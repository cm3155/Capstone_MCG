management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by welcome to todays hsbc q2 fixed income results conference call at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode there will be some opening remarks followed by questionandanswer session operator instructions i must advise you that this conference is being recorded today i would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today carlo pellerani group treasurer carlo pellerani group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc thank you sharon and hi everyone this is carlo im joined today by richard oconnor our head of investor relations and greg case head of debt investor relations together with richard boyns head of capital i joined hsbc in march after about nine years at ubs i know a few of you but looking forward to meeting the rest of you hopefully in person soon in the future my first few months at hsbc i have found the organization to be full of opportunities we have a tremendous franchise and that is also true in the financial resources space which is kind of the bread and butter of what we do in treasury we have a very strong set of resources and one of the key opportunities for us in the future is to look at how we optimize across all of those im sure you would have spent the last few days going through our results so what i thought of doing today is just giving you a very high level of introduction and then going straight to qa im not going to refer to any of the slides so today ill speak a little bit about the quarter our strategic delivery and our financial resources hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 04aug2021 so first on the quarter as you saw we generated pretax profit of billion for the quarter billion up yearon year and that included a release of million of ecls taking the yeartodate ecl release to million and as a reminder we still retained about billion of the ecls we had built out during the postcovid period second in terms of strategy we are making very good progress across all the four priorities that noel has said which as a reminder where to focus to digitize to energize and to transition you will see in the announcement from monday pages across all four so were very very happy on how that is progressing and alongside that we are well on track to meet the financial resource commitments that we had made including where reductions of cost and rwa programs in terms of financial resources first starting with balance sheet we have increased our loans by about for the quarter both on the side of mortgages and on the back of trade finance balances and our deposits have gone up by about in the quarter in terms of capital we continue to have a very very strong capital position our cet1 ratio of we have declared an interim dividend of per share for the first half of the year and we remain very comfortably above mda of about percentage points in terms of liquidity we also have a very very strong liquidity position we have about billion of hqla across the group you would have seen that we have announced a technical adjustment in our calculation of our lcr that is taking our lcr to which is about a adjustment which basically reflects a new methodology that better captures transferability challenges of liquidity across the group but just to stress that still represents significant surplus liquidity across the group we have over billion of surplus requirement across different entities of the group and finally to talk about funding in terms of our at1 you would have seen us in the market issuing about billion of at1 in yeartodate we have also redeemed billion and that is in line with the guidance that we had provided in broadly expect to issue for refinancing mainly we have no additional plan for at1 at the moment tier likewise we have very limited interest in that instrument for the moment and you shouldnt expect us to be anytime soon in the market in the mrel space our guidance for the year is billion as it was at the beginning of the year you would have seen us issuing about billion of mrel instruments during the last six months and you would have seen as well that we have started to venture in some of the locations that we ph havent passed in the past we had inaugural transactions in both hong kong dollars and in cny diversification is something that we deliberately will continue to pursue by trying to take a little bit of pressure off the most natural markets in particular the dollar markets where the majority of the demand is now there to depending on market conditions we would continue to look at other places for us to diversify our funding sources from that takes our mrel ratio to significantly above our or so requirement that we have and finally from an opco perspective subsidiaries have very little funding needs and opco issuances will continue to be relatively rare so just to wrap it up before we open for question we feel that this was another solid quarter good earnings diversification across the group and perhaps more importantly making very strategic progress on all our medium term goals on that note sharon we can open up for questions hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 04aug2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question today comes from the line of lee street from citigroup please go ahead your line is open lee street q analyst citigroup global markets ltd hello good afternoon all thank you thanks very much for taking my questions ive got a couple for you please firstly i guess as new treasury you talk about theres lots of opportunities just any thoughts on what maybe hsbc could do to make it a bit more efficient or what potentially might change or be different under your stewardship secondly i see in your pillar capital instruments disclosures youve got quite a few instruments that only work as capital till june of just any thoughts on did that actually to what extent are they a sort of serious impediment to resolution after june of and are there any fixes to get around that and then finally i suppose on a sort of similar vein or similar theme so youve got quite a lot of operating company or hsbc bank plc tier paper i think im correct in stating that obviously that wont work for mrel after this yearend but obviously still works as tier from a capital perspective so just any thoughts around how efficient that is for you as a form of capital instrument as one looks ahead they will be my three questions thank you very much carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc thank you thanks very much lee so from an opportunities perspective when you look across all the financial resources capital liquidity funding and also nii what you can see is that historically hsbc has had significant surpluses across all the metrics so what were trying to do is to make sure that the financial resources are fully deployed and aligned with our strategy so we are putting a strong spotlight on each of the resources and we are looking symmetrically as having too little resources or too much resources and trying to have the best deployment for all of those i can give you example if youre interested in each of those but one that perhaps is most obvious is on the liquidity side as i mentioned we have billionplus of surplus liquidity across the group a lot of that liquidity is not necessarily a bad thing if you kind of receive surplus deposits and those deposits are not costing you its not necessarily a bad thing but then what happens is those deposits in some entities generate capital requirements if those entities are leverageconstrained in other entities you have mrel requirements that are also driven by leverage requirements so there is a cost to those deposits even if they come at zero so what were doing is were putting a spotlight on all the resources were making sure that those are priced adequately to each of the businesses and each of the clients that are sourcing them and then were trying to find the best way of aligning them to the strategy of the group on your second question on lets call them legacy instrument and resolutions i mean this space is of course is extremely complicated and the way i would describe it is there are three dimensions that that have to be taken into account in simultaneously hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 04aug2021 one is the regulatory dimension you would have seen of course comments by the bank of england and pra about it we are in communication with them obviously cannot comment on the private discussion but that is an ongoing communication i would stress that this is not a space that from a regulatory perspective is black and white necessarily remember that when those instruments were issued they were fully compliant and somehow their rules are changing so that is a discussion were having with our supervisor and our regulator second there is of course the practicality dimension we need to see what is the practicality of potentially affecting those instruments the most challenging example perhaps in the new york loan instrument where the reason a magical solution that we have found about them so there are practical considerations that are perhaps challenging for us to affect those instruments and then finally are the economics of these transactions some of those economics are relatively easy from you for you from the outside to understand i mean clearly we have a fiduciary duty to our shareholders and we will look to ph us economically over time but some of the dynamics perhaps are been more difficult to observe externally because depending on whether we have or not hedged those instruments whether to the extent that we have hedges those are hedge accounts that are not the economics for us internally may not necessarily be the ones that youre expecting externally so long story short you have almost a triangle with those three dimension and depending on that then we are looking at what to do i cant comment on the discussions were having with the supervisor and regulator you will see us making a statement june next year when this public will make a selfassessment on resolvability coming october and on your third question yes i mean i guess at the moment that an instrument stops being stopped qualifying from a regulatory perspective and it changes if you want in the stack then of course the economics of that instrument change so to the extent that you had an instrument that was more junior that drops from there from the stack then you need to look at the pricing of that instrument in the context of replacement more senior instruments so that will be taken into account together with the practicality of potentially affecting that instrument in the market when at all times lee street q analyst citigroup global markets ltd okay thats helpful and just one quick followup there you suggested on the obviously discussions with indiscernible are ongoing theyre private i fully understand did you say the first that we would hear of that would be june next year or would you expect to for example in your pillar capital instruments disclose that yearend to disclose the ultimate treatment and the like then just because my understanding was this all needed to be wrapped up by the yearend when the grandfathering period ends so what would be the whats your best guess or whether you can give us on when you first might be communicating back to us on all of this carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc so the timeline is the timeline the official timeline is as follows we need to attest about we need to make a selfassessment on our resolution by 1st of october then that assessment is made public by both us and the bank of england by june next year to the extent there is something material in the interim according to our disclosure obligation then of course we would make that public hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 04aug2021 lee street q analyst citigroup global markets ltd okay thats very clear ill leave the floor for someone else thank you carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc cheers richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks lee operator thank you your next question comes from the line of violeta baraboi from société générale please go ahead your line is open violeta baraboi q analyst société générale sa uk hi good afternoon gentlemen thank you very much for having this call three questions on my side if i may the first one would be on the chinahong kong political situation has there been any commercial impact we havent heard anything about it on the equity call and thereve been things in the press about stateowned companies reducing activity with hsbc if you could give us a bit of color on that then the second question is about npl ratio so currently we have it at in stage and its unchanged year todate do you think that theyve already peaked and if not do you when do you think this ratio might peak and how far are we away from that peak currently and then the third question is about stage npls theyre still quite elevated at of the book and weve seen with other banks that most of them have seen reductions in stage and for some that there has been significant reductions therefore the question stands is do we are we going to slowly track back to levels thats around to or do you think its going to stay elevated for a while yeah thats it on my side thank you very much richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks violeta this is richard oconnor ill start with those three and let carlo chip in on the first one the chinahong kong situation clearly nothing much to say youve seen the hong kong and china results for the last months theyve been highly respectable weve at least maintained market share had yet another good mortgage performance based on trade performance taking market share in hong kong indiscernible in mainland china good growth in the book there heavy investments in the wealth business showing early signs of bearing fruit weve got ph clients in china were not going to comment on any individual one of them be them state owned or other but weve run a very good pipeline of deals and transactions including from the government to the bond issuance in china weve also won licenses so a fintech license first of all a fintech license and were obviously looking to expand that particularly that wealth franchise as we said into five more cities hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 04aug2021 so results are very solid customer engagement very strong very resilient results and economically you can see that hong kong china continue to perform well despite obviously nearterm challenges from covid in china weve seen in the last week unfortunately and hopefully that situation improves so yeah no we continue to invest heavily and the business continues to perform well we obviously want to perform even better thats why were investing more heavily in the business and those investments are showing good signs of traction and we really strive for very good relationships with the regulating governments at all levels in china and have very good engagement with them on the stage ill give you two contradictory answers look you saw the stage charges in q2 were very very low in fact they were zero of that million recovery we dont think you should expect that every quarter as we said to the equity analysts you do some of those get a bit of bumpiness in our stage charges and indeed our stage balances but with that obviously youve seen that that stage npl being broadly stable and ultimately not a lot in the pipeline so with the comment that it can be volatile were hopeful as economies improve that over the next months you do see those stage balances come down but again with the proviso that at the early stage of the economic cycle sometimes you get some latestage impairments as economies start to come out of difficult economic situations ill just give you one example obviously in the uk were seeing people coming off furlough companies are starting to pay down ph effectively government debt so theres still some uncertainties out there but generally youre seeing stage npls very stable and were hopeful they could nudge down from whats already quite a respectable level over the coming quarters ill just correct your language on stage its not stage npls its stage balances which as you say are quite high at of the book they did come down slightly in q2 and again we would expect that to continue as is as we all expect the economies will recover over the coming quarters its difficult to prepare banks on a likefor like basis because we certainly do quite a lot of overlays when we look at stage balances so i personally wouldnt compare each bank by bank look at the trends look at the commentary and look at the overall condition of the book and the condition of our book is good its been very very solid through the last months and we expect that to continue and net net would expect the stage overlays to reduce but each bank has a slightly different methodology and we think our stage overlays to get to that are higher than some of our peer banks violeta baraboi q analyst société générale sa uk understood thank you very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of corinne cunningham from autonomous please go ahead your line is open corinne cunningham q analyst bernstein autonomous llp afternoon everyone just a quick one from me on mrel do you think the crr leverage requirement is going to drop out of your requirements do you think its going to stop being a binding requirement i guess with the focus more on rwas weve seen that with a couple of other significant uk banks i just wondered if that was happening the same with yourselves thank you hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 04aug2021 carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc hi thanks for the question corinne so the mrel requirements for us as you saw is the most binding of three dimensions the rwa the leverage requirements or the sum of the parts at the moment and for the foreseeable future we see both the leverage requirement and the sum of the part being kind of equally binding if you decompose the sum of the parts components as well that you will see that in each of the different resolution groups leverage then also to be one of the important drivers so even if you got to a position where leverage in aggregate didnt become binding it might be binding in sum of the parts bottomup calculation so you almost need to do the calculation bottomup and then trying to figure out what it is of course when you are at the margin of where we are that sum of the parts or leverage is the most binding then perhaps there is a little bit of stickiness to the calculation as we said were guiding that the current requirement is about in rwa terms around corinne cunningham q analyst bernstein autonomous llp thank you and given that youve issued all of your mrel from the holding company anyway would it just be easier to become a single point of entry or are there other technical reasons why you stick with the multiple point of entry carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc well easy to become a single point of entry is it depends on what you mean by easy so let me step back so we like to call ourselves an mpeplus group what that basically means is that the group issues mrel topdown and distributes to the entity but the fact that we have three resolution groups at least in theory that could be advantageous from a resolution perspective because it gives our supervisor an optionality that perhaps other groups do not have and the optionality is to either hold the group together or to resolve it as three separate groups at least at the beginning in that hypothetical resolution we can ph and the days that ensue holding the groups together has a big advantage because it is you preserve value you avoid chaos its better from a systemic perspective and from not from a marketwide perspective and then it buys you time to allow you to then to extract the most value to the group and to minimize the impact that it may have into the system then in terms of if that is the starting point then the question is what is the advantage or disadvantage in going either sb or purely mp if any and then do remember that there are a lot of parties involved in this discussion there are interests in each of the different regions so at the moment we have a situation where potentially everyone has kind of the best possible solution because there is optionality obviously we continuously review these together with the colleagues and supervisors but as i said at the moment we are an mpeplus for the reasons that i mentioned corinne cunningham q analyst bernstein autonomous llp thanks very much hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 04aug2021 operator thank you operator instructions your next question comes from the line of tom jenkins from jefferies please go ahead your line is open tom jenkins q analyst jefferies thank you good afternoon gents good afternoon everybody ive got one question and i suppose one point of order ill start with the question and then go to point of order as usual lee and corinne have nicked my best questions unfortunately obviously triggerhappy on star one but there was one i still had which was youve obviously in the process of divesting some chunks of business in france and in the us obviously not the equity of the entities more the assets or the branches or whatever you want to call it there is debt left in those entities that either looks redundant from a regulatory perspective or expensive from a capital utility perspective i was just wondering is there what is a look ill leave it openended whats your thinking on those debts and then the point of order is and i think probably everyone on this call will agree and i hope they do is that we are very blessed in the uk to have fantastic ir people on fixed income so and i just want to say and i hope i embarrass him terribly but i just want to say that greg is one of the very better ones so invoking the olympic spirit im not going to give him the gold medal necessarily but hes definitely on the podium but for the question id appreciate an answer carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc yeah i was going to say i mean first of all on your last question tom its a bit early for the bonus season so if you and greg have had a discussion offline i mean it maybe you should have waited another call for doing that but thank you we appreciate that i mean on your question in terms of disposal i mean obviously what we do is we look at the balances that are being transferred and the resulting effects right so you just need to look at what is being transferred so in the case of the us we are disposing about billion of loans and about billion of deposits with billion of rwa so from a specifics that means that basically all else equal there is an billion funding gap that needs to be compensated for its not exactly like that because their surpluses and the requirements are different but that is high level the way to look at it in the case of france its actually quite balanced customer lending is billion and deposits billion so the way it happens is you look at what is being transferred you look at the resulting effects on all the financial resources plus also on the economics of your natural hedging that you had in place and then you kind of rebalance but there isnt anything meaningful coming out of both of them there isnt anything significant from a debt holder perspective to mention the only thing i would point out that it would be our intention to try to move the cover bond programs to the buyers in france that requires consent of the bond holders but except for that it should not be a major issue from a liabilities perspective i dont know richard if there is anything else you want to say richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc no i dont have very much to say tom you need to look whats left we will retain substantial wholesale businesses in both and in the us a mediumsized but highly indiscernible wealth with this which will still hold the majority of the deposits via value because they were obviously the higher value customers hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 04aug2021 so i think you need to look at it in context of the entity or entities concerned and the fact is a its good news that ph we are exiting these mass retail operations but were not exiting france and the us remains substantial economies we risk heavily in both there is very strong connectivity with the rest of the group a very strong multinational business wholesale and markets business in both obviously paris being the center of our eurozone activities and the us being the biggest capital market in the world so i think you need to live in the context of the total balance sheet in both and as carlo said these are not meaningful transactions from just a pure balance sheet indiscernible but they are meaningful in terms of the profit and loss of both entities so i would look at it from a pl and returns perspective rather than sort of a funding perspective although clearly you need to look at both tom jenkins q analyst jefferies well no in that case richard ph fine color thank you ph thats quite enormous i mean if thats the case then one if youre looking at it from pl perspective and again i do not know how you hedged or hedged against sort of various bonds but if im looking at sort of whatever 75year 80year bonds ive got to pay 7andchange percent for that almost minimal capital im just wondering what types of that would be in the us just for example carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc yes i can say the only other dimension to think about it is of course the value of focus in the strategy right so obviously focusing on our strength and trying to avoid a dilution of management in areas that are perhaps less kind of in line with our strategic there is an additional value but yeah the point you make is a valid one we look at that and of course as we rebalance we take it into account richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah indiscernible carlo said about looking at our capital security including indiscernible capital securities those points remain validly as much as anywhere else tom jenkins q analyst jefferies great chaps thanks very much indeed richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks tom thank you tom jenkins q analyst jefferies have a lovely afternoon operator thank you we will take our last question from the line of alvaro ruiz from morgan stanley please go ahead your line is open hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 04aug2021 alvaro ruiz de alda q analyst morgan stanley co international plc hello guys thank you very much for taking my call and i have a very specific question and its about the disco issued from the hong kong bank ph as per your pillar security is not eligible any more after january and reading all your disclosures this bank has indiscernible liquidity i guess ph will it have some sense about the economics about not redeeming these security the more information the better but i know that you cannot disclose that much thank you very much carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc hi alvaro thanks for the question you answered the question for me we cannot quite disclose namespecific so i so what are the things that i could say that are helpful i think the first thing is just to restate what you said is the security in locally doesnt have regulatory eligibility so of course going back to what i was saying earlier the economics of the security have to be assessed against the replacement cost of a more senior note and hence a cheaper note having said that the spreads on those securities are relatively cheap it gives you a longterm optionality so the way to think about it is to the point youre making you assess the surplus liquidity you have you assess what are the additional kind of expectations you have in time you tried to project that and then you decide whether there is a need for the security or indeed there is a value in keeping it but im afraid thats all i can say but i think that from your question i think the components that youre raising are the right ones to consider alvaro ruiz de alda q analyst morgan stanley co international plc and just to confirm you look the security independent from the other securities each without the indiscernible bank carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc broadly broadly yes broadly yes we look at each of the entities so mrel is pulled down from the top from the entity so the entity will have a requirement and the requirement triggers a demand from the holding company and the holding company will put it down so you start at the entity and the requirements of the entity to evaluate the need and the economics indeed alvaro ruiz de alda q analyst morgan stanley co international plc sorry im just lost the securities are not mreleligible then its just your funding if you just compare it with the cost of deposits or am i missing something carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc no those are the right components alvaro ruiz de alda q analyst morgan stanley co international plc okay thank you very much hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 04aug2021 carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc thanks alvaro operator thank you i will now hand the call back for any closing remarks carlo pellerani group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc well thank you thank you very much for joining hopefully the this qa was useful if you have
