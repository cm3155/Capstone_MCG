kemper umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thank you kay and thanks everyone for joining us today i hope you and your families are safe and well as we approach the ninth month of this adjusted way of doing business at serving our customers our systems are performing well and were continuing our measured approach to the return to the workplace we had a multi phase plan and currently have about of our nonbranch associates in our corporate facilities the majority of our associate base still remains remote we continue to meet with our customers and our branches by appointment or through our driveup operations at most locations our teams are very adept at virtual meetings and have had success with calling efforts but i know well all be ready for an eventual return to inperson interactions and a handshake these times have reinforced what weve always known relationships matter im extremely proud and impressed with how our associates continue to adapt while maintaining those relationships with our customers and each other doing whats right to support our workforce customers and communities is one of our priorities along with maintaining our high quality underwriting standards and solid capital and liquidity levels our third quarter results reflect those priorities with net chargeoffs of just of total loans improving past due trends and doubledigit yearoveryear growth on both sides of the balance sheet on the credit front provision for the quarter was million reflecting the quality of our loan book and a reduction in modified loan balances third quarter provision represents times net chargeoffs of million the reserve build in the third quarter brings our total allowance for credit losses on loans to million at september with an allowance to loan coverage of excluding ppp loans that coverage is or nearly two times what it was at yearend prior to the adoption of cecl total reserves were million or times nonperforming assets compared to the peer median of times based on those who have reported today we expect the bulk of our reserve build maybe behind us our portfolio is wellpositioned and we havent seen material signs of deterioration in our markets todate however there are several significant factors including the election the next round of stimulus and the duration of the pandemic that will impact the economy and our borrowers this underscores the importance of our strong credit and capital position during the quarter we completed our first subordinated debt issuance with million or ph fixedtofix rate notes the opportunity to bring in this tier capital at an attractive rate strengthens our already solid capital levels and reduces our overall cost of capital our total riskbased capital ratios improved basis points to for the third quarter our top priority for use of capital remains organic growth as we have opportunities for deeper penetration in many of our markets and lending verticals and as market conditions allow well continue to look for the opportunities to augment that growth with strategic acquisitions returning capital to our shareholders has long been important to us and as stated in the press release the board just approved a dividend increase payable in january another anecdote ill share today is that next spring marks our 50th anniversary of our listing on the nasdaq we went public in and have paid a dividend for each of the past years more recently weve increased our annual dividend interrupted since thats years of increases even through the great recession for a total increase of nearly thats something im very proud of now moving back to our results we posted net income of million or per share for the third quarter pretax preprovision income of million represents a increase over the linkedquarter and a umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 increase compared to the third quarter of total fee income was strong at million the quarterover quarter decrease of million was largely driven by marketrelated adjustments including coli valuations along with decreased gains on sale of securities but we had positive trends in the trust and securities processing line and card spending volume increased from the lower levels in the second quarter driving improved interchange income ram will share more details on those drivers shortly net interest income increased from the second quarter as we posted strong loan volumes and growth in the afs book while lower deposits and borrowing costs helped us partially mitigate reduced earning asset yields despite these unprecedented times average loans excluding ppp balances increased on a linkedquarter annualized basis and ill note that we surpassed for the first time billion in assets new loan production outside of ppp was million the highest origination level yeartodate commercial line utilization remains stable from the prior quarter at this is similar to the recent averages after the spike in march and april average loan growth was again driven largely by commercial and consumer real estate last quarter i mentioned the mortgage prequalification applications hit record highs and we saw some of that in resulting growth with average consumer real estate loans increasing linked quarter our loan portfolio remains diverse and wellbalanced across several product lines geographies and industries total composition is shown on slide followed by loan activity during the quarter and breakdowns of our commercial portfolio by asset class our billion ppp loan portfolio is shown by industry and geography on slide were preparing to accept forgiveness applications in the next few days on slide youll see updated our exposure to sensitive industries at june we reported that approximately of our total loans excluding ppp balances were in what we call a potentially more impacted category at the end of september that was down to total loans in these categories are billion representing of our loan portfolio however after analysis we feel that approximately billion or could possibly carry more risk since if the crisis is prolonged we are closely monitoring these relationships and have regular communication with these borrowers the granular look at these loan types is included in the loan risk table on page in the asset quality section this data shows the quality of our loan portfolio and contains details on our modified loans by category on the following slide youll see that we have a reduction of more than in modified loan balances compared to the second quarter as you recall based on an initial request we approved approximately billion in modifications however many of those were ultimately not needed by the customers at september loan modification balances had dropped to million or of loans down from billion or of loans last quarter and if you exclude the portion related to our business banking portfolio we had just million remaining in business banking which includes our practice solution clients largely dental offices we proactively offer six month deferrals many were made in april and may therefore the deferrals are scheduled to expire during the fourth quarter we expect the vast majority of our clients to return to normal payment status and early indications are very positive finally as you may have seen in our press release early last week were excited about a recent success story in our small business investment company umb capital corporation our million investment in ittella international initiated in resulted in a ownership stake in tattooed chef following its ipo which was umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 completed on october this is truly a lifecycle investment for us showcasing the capabilities of our capital finance division our relationship with ittella began in our assetbased lending group and we were able to partner with them as they grew our capabilities allow us to meet a variety of capital needs for our clients at each stage of development from mezzanine to working capital in closing i reiterate that we continue to manage for the longterm with a strong capital and liquidity position a history of prudent risk management and diverse revenue sources this helps provide buffers in the interest rate environment and serves us well as we navigate through the crisis now ill turn it back over to ram ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thank you mariner looking at the quarterly results net interest income of million represents an increase of million from the second quarter driven by strong growth in ci and cre loans and a larger afs portfolio total earning asset yields fell basis points to from the linked quarter driven by yield declines of basis points in both loans and total securities net interest spread decreased basis points from the second quarter and was down only basis point from a year ago net interest margin compressed by basis points on a linked quarter basis drivers of this change included negative basis points from lower reinvestment rates and market changes to the afs portfolio a basis point reduction from the reduced benefit of free funds and negative basis points related to earning asset mix shift partially offset by a basis point impact from deposit mix along with cd and money market rate changes liquidity levels remain elevated and consistent with the second quarter levels at over times level seen a year ago as we noted in the release we terminated our million interest rate floor hedge for million during the third quarter the unrealized gain remaining in aoci was million which will be amortized into net interest income through september of noninterest income as shown on slide was million for the quarter a reduction of million valuation adjustments and companyowned life insurance income accounted for million of the sequential decline this decrease is offset by a similar decrease in deferred compensation expense gains on sale of securities accounted for an additional million decline from the linked quarter we saw improved trends in asset servicing with our alternative investment registered funds administration and custody businesses driving the largest portion of the million increase in trust and securities processing income bankcard fees improved or million from the second quarter driven by a linkedquarter increase in card spending volume weve seen spending levels improve from april lows but they remain below prepandemic levels we believe there has been some catchup in routine medical and dental care following the shutdowns earlier in the year and healthcare spending surpassed yearoveryear levels commercial credit purchase volumes improved over the second quarter but are still below prioryear levels with corporate travel and entertainment still on hold for many companies public sector spending is down due to significant decreases in new fiscal year budgets and many schools across our footprint are either not open or at limited capacity the million linkedquarter reduction in investment banking fee income was driven largely by lower municipal and corporate bond volumes after a very strong second umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 quarter additionally market valuation adjustments in our trading portfolio accounted for million of the decrease beginning in the fourth quarter our fee income will be subject to some volatility from market value adjustments to our position in tattooed chef as part of the transaction we received million in cash and just over million shares of ttcf a publicly traded entity changes in market values on our share ownership will flow through our income statement as unrealized gains or losses at each reporting period based on recent trading levels our fourth quarter gains may be approximately million to million but obviously will be adjusted to reflect the stock price at quarterend expenses for the quarter decreased or million compared to the second quarter largely driven by an million decrease in deferred compensation expense the offset to the decreased coli income i mentioned further detail is shown on slide the tax rate for the quarter was and for the full year we anticipate it will be approximately to moving to the balance sheet average deposits increased on a linked quarter basis and dda balances grew by free funds now comprised just over of total deposits we continue to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios bolstered by the sub debt offering during the quarter with our total riskbased capital at cet1 ratio at and a leverage ratio at tangible common equity to assets was trends in our capital ratios are shown on slide our tangible book value per share increased to at the end of the quarter up from a year ago for comparison our peers that have reported so far have shown an increase of that concludes our prepared remarks and ill now turn it back over to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question today comes from chris mcgratty with kbw mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning ram good morning mariner nice quarter overall im hoping to talk a little bit about expenses to start you guys had them pretty wellcontrolled this quarter but rereading the transcript from last quarter you talked about just a really big focus on expenses given the revenue environment interested in your thoughts about expenses investments you may need to make and potential sources of rationalizations to thanks mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yes this is mariner thanks for the question as weve been talking the last few quarters we remain very focused on being an efficient company and weve undertaken over time any number of exercises but really its more the way were operating and we are able to with digitization and acceptance of digitization from the customer base weve been able to continue to find efficiencies through the use of technology we continue to manage staffing levels based on performance and continue to look at our physical plant and you should expect us to continue to focus on expenses without giving you any particular guidance christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc maybe just on one line item and in the expenses the personnel number ram was somewhat high in the last couple of quarters im interested how much of that was kind of a catch up from really low first quarter and bonus accruals and maybe that line item is that in this indiscernible is that a decent jumping off point to kind of forecast growth ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes the one thing that flows through that line item is also our deferred comp expense right so quarterover quarter we saw some movement over there depending on what happens with the market but usually theres equal offset on the coli side so if you look at just what happened this particular quarter we have deferred comp expenses of just under million which was down about million from the prior quarter but if you exclude that noise theres always the usual seasonal resets and fica but the overall incentives were just impacted by some of the trading volumes that you see the bond trading has been a pretty strong headline for us other fee income opportunities have also been a strong headline so anything volume related will always increase salaries from one period to another period but these salaries just umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 when you look at salaries and wages what you see in the fourth quarter is probably a good starting point enter christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and if i could just on a couple of modeling questions the ppp can you let us know what was in the quarter for the fees what remains and then yes i guess into like a cadence of the fees mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp ram do you take that ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes ill take that so whats in our fees right now is just a plain vanilla finance charge of and the amortization of the origination fee as you know as mariner said well be or were gearing up to take forgiveness applications and so none of that is really in our fee income or net interest income base for the third quarter chances are with the way the process is playing out therell be a very little impact if any in the fourth quarter and most of it will be probably in christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then on the taxes if i could it sounds like the fourth quarter a little bit of a higher tax rate ram and then how do we think about the sensitivity if we do get a change in administration to some of the proposals that are being floated in washington with the tax hikes mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yes christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc is it assumed yes ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp on the first part so we said to yes a higher tax rate for the fourth quarter a lot of it would depend on our pretax income as i said in my script we might have as much as million million gain from our investment in tattooed chef so when pretax income goes up your tax rate effective tax rate will also go up on the second part of that if corporate tax rate went from to well see probably about a basis point increase on our etr when that goes into effect christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc awesome thank you very much umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks chris operator our next question comes from nathan race with piper sandler nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yes hi guys good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey nate ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey nate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co i was hoping to start on credit it looks like this quarter indiscernible was largely a function of criticized and classified trends in the quarter so just curious to get a sense of how that trended during and if a lot of that criticized and classified inflow was just concentrated in that atrisk portfolios that have been outlined in the slide deck or if theres some other areas that also saw some inflows mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp on the provision expense largely it is definitely based on mostly credit performance dont have much macro modelingrelated provision expense in the third quarter to speak of not much so its mostly just credit performance and it was a good quarter from that perspective with basis points in chargeoffs and the typical growth level weve been seeing so its nice growth from the quarter two so performances performance is strong and growth is strong and thats basically what you saw on the provision expense for the most part if that answers the question nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yes thats helpful thanks mariner i guess i was also just hoping to get some color just in terms of broader criticized and classified trends in the quarter i dont think there was a slide mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp sure you noticed so theyre on youll see this in the 10q our criticized are down so overall criticized are slightly down nothing to note as it relates to overall the way we think about all this so npas ticked up slightly but criticized in total are down nothing to note really we dont expect anything different when it comes to charge offs in the coming periods that we dont see or expect today as we look at the data its the same kind of comment umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 ive made before which is well see some spikes along the top as it relates to putting credits on the watch list or a credit going to npa as we are very quick to manage credits at umb were quick to identify problems were quick to manage them so youll see peaks and valleys along the top but whats really important the way we look at it and the way we think about it is theres very little migration to doubtful and loss and thats what we care about and thats what we think about and we dont expect anything different in as far as we can see out right now as relates to migration to doubtful and loss nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great yes thats super helpful and then just thinking about the margin trajectory going forward of ppps ram any thoughts obviously securities reinvestment rates are a challenge these days but it seems like indiscernible remains pretty solid so hopefully that change in earned assets should help going forward but just kind of any thoughts on how you see that core margin trajectory through the fourth quarter and early ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes sure i can take that if you think about the two main reasons for margin compression today right as you mentioned its the reinvestment rates on our afs book are lower than whats rolling off and we have some data in our slide deck that shows we have close to billion of maturities coming over the next months at a rate and for instance what we reinvested in september had a handle on it right so theres some compression and the other thing thats happening is also the earning asset mix shift not only within the loan book but between loans and earning assets a lot of it is because of the liquidity bill so the big wildcard as you rightly pointed will be the pace of ppp runoffs right and for instance if you assumed all our ppp balances ran off in the third quarter and were replaced by nonppp loans our margin would have been basis points higher this quarter but thats not how its going to play out in the short run so as ppp loans exit we would expect our loanto deposit ratio probably come down point or and thats going to probably drive a little bit more of the unfavorable earning mix shift that i talked about and then the other wildcard is also the excess liquidity part so while it was stable as i said on a linkedquarter basis its still about times where it was prepandemic levels and for us in our businesses as you all know well see more liquidity in the fourth and first quarters from public funds business so all said i would say i probably expect margin to trough in the next couple of quarters because of excess liquidity and this other ppp dynamic im talking about bu what we do we always said this in these lower rate environments low interest rate environments we tend to focus on net interest income growth so that always will be a differentiator for us well keep the dry powder in terms of deposits to deploy later nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it thats great color i appreciate it guys taking the questions thank you umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks nathan operator operator instructions our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning guys mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yes i guess indiscernible you to followup on the nii focus is it safe to assume just given the kind of growth that you guys are seeing exppp we should expect nii growth to continue or do you see any reason why nii could actually decline over the coming quarters mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i mean just based on what ram just said its likely that itll continue to increase just to ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and got it maybe just on credit manner if you take a step back i know you feel very good about your loan book for a bank that is actually growing the loan portfolio just talk to us as you think about the puts and takes in terms of the macro outlook looking into the next year do you see are you more worried about credit or are you more optimistic about growth when you think about mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp so ebrahim you know me pretty well youve watched us for a while im a career pessimist so we the thing about the way we underwrite is were always underwriting for the next crisis so as it relates to how we underwrite in general were always prepared for the worst we always underwrite to the worstcase scenario so were really not doing anything different in the way that we underwrite were we want to bank customers that know that things can get bad and have built equity and have global cash flow and sponsor strength and all those kinds of things people that we bank people who believe what we believe is that we believe in gravity we believe that what goes up must come down and so were always underwriting that way so we dont wait for a crisis to operate like theres a crisis umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 and so as we think of the first quarter a couple of comments first quarter and second quarter a couple comments i would make about our outlook for that you know i dont we dont believe that the economy cares who the president is we also dont believe that were going to go into the new year without another stimulus package and so we believe that therell be stimulus and we dont believe that the markets care who is president what we worry about is if the coronavirus pandemic were to get worse that would likely apply some pressure to our more sensitive impacted credit list that weve provided for you the investor community so thats what we worry about we i think that as it relates to the rest of our book i think well go on into the next year uninterrupted for the with the rest of the with the book but as it relates to some of those industries that weve identified that are sensitive to the pandemic we would likely see some stress there however i would revert back to my original comment which is that when we originated those credits we originated them knowing that things could get worse and so we assess global cash flow sponsor strength loan to values location cap rates were very conservative about the way we look at those things and so we know that there while there will be stress we dont worry particularly about higher than normal loss levels ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it that is helpful thanks mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks ebrahim operator operator instructions seeing no further
