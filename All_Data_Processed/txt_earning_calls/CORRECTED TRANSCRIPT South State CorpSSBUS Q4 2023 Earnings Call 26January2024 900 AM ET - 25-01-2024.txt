statements and risks and uncertainties which may affect us now ill turn the call over to john corbett our ceo south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp thanks will good morning everybody thank you for joining us you can see in the earnings release that southstate delivered a solid quarter that was consistent with our guidance high level it was another quarter of steady loan and customer deposit growth with midsingle digit growth in both nim dipped a couple basis points but is leveling off and capital ratios are growing nicely the end of the year is always a time for reflection as we look back on and specifically the turmoil last spring it was a period that demonstrated the resilience of southstate particularly the resilience of our granular deposit franchise the resilience of our asset quality and the resilience of the high growth markets where we operate a new census report was issued last month and not surprising florida south carolina north carolina and georgia were all in the top five fastestgrowing states in the country during and since the pandemic over million people have moved to florida southstate is a company that was forged during the great recession during a decade of rapid consolidation the culmination of that period was a merger of equals announced four years ago this month that significant event in our history was an opportunity to catch our breath and spend a couple years to retool the guts of the bank specifically in the areas of technology and risk management our goal was to strengthen the infrastructure without sacrificing our decentralized and entrepreneurial culture it was painstaking work that affected every area of the bank we upgraded different technology platforms and increased our annual technology spend by annual spending on technology in is estimated to be million more than it was in on the risk management side our program has matured to meet the heightened expectations of the occ we upgraded with experienced professionals from the big banks and strengthened the three lines of defense during the first couple years those technology and risk management changes took a toll on our employees and impacted the customer experience but it was shortterm pain for longterm gain so with a larger bank infrastructure in place our focus pivoted in to making our employees and customers lives better we needed to refine the new technology so that it was serving us rather than the other way around and i think weve been largely successful employee engagement is now back to the top quartile of our peers and were beginning to leverage the power of the new technology now in as we approach the end of the covid era and hopefully a more normal yield curve we believe we can deliver outsized shareholder returns in the future its a future thats possible because of the hard work over the last few years so ill close by thanking our team for preparing us for this next chapter ill pass it back to will now to walk you through the details on the quarter william e matthews senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thank you john as you noted the fourth quarter was a good finish to a year in which southstate reported solid performance and soundness profitability and growth while facing a relatively volatile environment ill touch on a few details before we move to qa on the balance sheet fourth quarter annualized loan growth of brought our fullyear growth to customer deposit growth excluding the maturing brokered cds we didnt replace of annualized approximately matched south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 the loan growth rate for the full year total deposits grew with customer deposits essentially flat ddas represented of total deposits at quarter end down another percent from last quarter leaving us near the levels we were prepandemic for dda as a percentage of deposits turning to the income statement our nim was down basis points from the prior quarter and consistent with our to guidance loan yields in q4 were up basis points and deposits were up basis points in line with our basis point to basis point guidance this brings our cycletodate loan beta to and our cycletodate deposit beta to our net interest income of million was essentially flat with the third quarter for the fullyear margin comparison versus 2023s nim of ph was basis points higher than 2022s while the cost of deposits rose from basis points in to basis points in in a period of basis points of fed rate hikes not to mention the march crisis while its been a challenging period in which to manage a financial institution balance sheet i think our margin performance during this period of rapid change really highlights the value of our core funding base noninterest income of million was down million from q3 and at basis points ph of assets was in line with our basis points to basis points guidance correspondent revenue was million after million in interest expense on swap collateral ph per million in gross revenue down approximately million from q3 wealth had a record quarter with revenue exceeding million and we had a strong quarter in deposit fees similar to q3 and last years fourth quarter mortgage revenue continued to be weak though ill compliment our leadership on their performance in this challenged environment we track various metrics versus the mortgage bankers association quarterly performance report and our team consistently outperforms the industry in several key metrics operating expenses of million which excludes the million for the fdic special assessment were in line with our expectations and were above q3 levels due to some of the items we mentioned in our third quarter call looking ahead we expect nie for q1 in the mid to high subject to normal variations in the expense categories impacted by noninterest income and performance with respect to credit we recognized ph million in net chargeoffs in the quarter bringing our year todate total to million or basis points for the quarter and basis points for the full year of the years net chargeoffs million came from deposit accounts and million from loans for approximately basis points in loan net chargeoffs our provision expense was million for the quarter and million for the year leaving our ending total reserve to remain approximately flat at basis points of loans and over the last two years weve provisioned million against only million in net chargeoffs so weve built our reserves appropriately under cecl in advance of potential credit deterioration for overall asset quality trends npas were up million driven by an increase in sba loan nonaccruals which are or more government guaranteed special mention loans declined and substandard loans increased the increase in over is due to utility company storm repair receivables in our factoring business these typically turn slowly and the majority of these have been collected since quarter end loan pastdues were down quarter overquarter of our npas are current on payments and the pastdue npas are centered on the sba consumer and residential portfolios ill reiterate that we do not see significant loss content in our portfolio south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 di line utilization was up in the quarter and home equity line of credit utilization was down slightly we continue to have very strong capital ratios with a ce tier of or if aoci were included in the calculation the movedown in interest rates caused our aoci to shrink helping our ending tce to grow to our ending tbv per share grew to up for the year during the fourth quarter we repurchased  at a volumeweighted average price of we continue to believe riskweighted asset growth and capital formation rate should be in a range that allows us to continue to grow our regulatory capital ratios and provide us with great flexibility operator well now take questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of catherine mealor with kbw your line is open catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i guess to start with your margin outlook margin came right in line with your guidance for this quarter im just curious how youre thinking about the margin to this year maybe and how youre thinking about how rate cuts impact your margin outlook thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure catherine its steve thanks for asking the question we have a page that we show every quarter on page its the nim trend and as you mentioned it went down from to so basis points but within our guidance between and our deposit cost increased basis points which was within our guidance of basis points to basis points so as we think about its interestearning assets its rate forecast and then our deposit beta assumptions so for interestearning assets for the fullyear were sort of just reiterating the billion thats sort of what weve thought about for the last several quarters so were thinking billion wed start out like the fourth quarter was in the million range and so i wouldnt expect that to be much different coming out of the out of first quarter seasonality south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 as it relates to the second assumption which is the rate forecast the moodys consensus which is what we use shows four rate cuts in they start in april and then we have four rate cuts in so you would end the year at fed funds in and our assumption you would hit fed funds rate at by the end of on our deposit beta page which is our cycletodate beta is and we would continue to expect deposit costs to increase similarly in the fourth quarter before we get rate cuts sometime in the second quarter its how we see ph it so deposit cost between in the first quarter so i guess based on all those assumptions we would expect the fullyear nim to average somewhere between and for the full year in and we would sort of expect the first half to be in that to range and then exiting the back half in that to range so thats kind of how were thinking about with those assumptions as we think about and we think about another four rate cuts in were thinking as we model it somewhere in that to nim range in depending on how we exit and then just kind of the last point ill make is if we kind of play this out and the forward curve is sort of showing that at the end of we sort of have a to fed funds rate and sort of a flatter upwardsloping curve would look a lot like when our nims were in the yeah maybe range so anyway as we kind of think about the short medium and long thats sort of how were thinking about it related to the forecast catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and thats really helpful indiscernible guidance this earnings season indiscernible stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp indiscernible catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i love it i love it yeah but this is really helpful and its just its interesting it feels like youve just got upward momentum in your margin and i think im curious to ph see how you are thinking about how deposit costs play into that i mean youve got such an opportunity to reprice assets on the way up even if we get rate cuts i feel like your loan yields are still going to be moving up just given the way youre structured there and so are there significant declines in deposit costs throughout all these assumptions or is it more kind of a stabilization in deposit cost and then just and really whats driving the higher margin is just upward momentum on the asset side stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah no its a good question so maybe start with the asset side i think we talked about it last quarter but just to reiterate we in we have well over billion of fixed rate and adjustable rate repricings that are going to happen in i think in its like billion and with billion so its a healthy amount every year and so yeah those are somewhere in the to range for all three of those years so theyre kind of south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 fixed in there as we think about so thats going to be a tailwind assuming that the fiveyear treasury doesnt move much lower than therell be a spread over that if you think about the deposit rates our money market accounts youve seen a big increase in that over the last months think if you looked in the earnings release i think our money market accounts went up maybe billion or so and our cds went up about billion and a lot of that was negotiated rates and so in our total portfolio of deposits we have about a little over billion of negotiated rates that weve given to our team to that theyve managed to exception price on the flip side of that we have about billion of floating rate loans about of our loans is floating so you kind of look at both of those and they sort of maybe not perfectly offset each other but help cds theres another billion that eventually will reprice to the front end of the curve over time and then the we have securities thatll reprice so anyway i guess the big tailwind to your point is really trying to manage the floating rate assets versus the negotiated deposits and cds and then the fixed rate loans over time are sort of your help to margin i dont know if thats helpful but ph sort of how we think about it catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah yeah thats very very helpful all right great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of stephen scouten with piper sandler your line is open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone im kind of curious you mentioned the dda percentage will would kind of back down to the prepandemic level do we think this can kind of stabilize here at this level or you expect a little bit more mix shift as we move on maybe prior to a potential rate cut william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp steve its hard to say i think a few quarters ago we probably would have thought this would be where we end up its given that weve seen continued decline in that percentage i dont think its unreasonable to say it might go down further from here i dont know how much further the pace of that change has mitigated quite a bit the last few quarters but its hard to say that were at the end necessarily but its really its hard to know stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah and to wills point i mean its sort of been a situation where its gone down its just its ph where and when does the fed pivot and so its probably at that point is when all that changes but thats a indiscernible stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co for sure okay and how should we think about kind of the provision and reserves moving forward i mean obviously you guys have talked about how much youve built relative to net chargeoff ph think will said you dont really see material or significant loss content in the book so it kind of felt like a big directional south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 reversal this quarter maybe whats kind of normalized net chargeoffs for you as you think about your portfolio and do you think we could see this reserve start to trend down given no significant worsening in the core book william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yes yes steve and i think the way i think about it our chargeoffs last year were basis points and thats theyve been very low for last several years but i think its reasonable to expect they normalize a bit from such a low level and to extent they do that would impact provision expense so we did as we highlighted build our reserve the last couple years in advance of potential deterioration in the economy but depending on our charge off levels from here that could lead to provision expense to cover those chargeoffs and depending on whatever else the model tells us as far as normalized chargeoffs i dont have a good number to estimate i mean when you look back at peer group ph itll certainly be higher than what weve experienced but i think its hard to say for certain that we could hang in there below basis points every year in net chargeoffs but be great if we could stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay good and then just last thing from me maybe to john this is maybe more your side of the coin here wondering around ma in this environment obviously i know was a tough year but you guys fared phenomenally well so a relatively advantaged currency rate presumably coming down making the math a little bit better im just kind of wondering how you think about ma this year and the potential for executing a deal john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah sure as ive said previously i mean were open for business and to your point i suspect that the math is becoming easier with the lower interest rate marks but stephen really no change from our prior guidance i mean our ideal partner if we were to do something would be in a to a third of our proforma company were in great markets in the southeast and wed prefer to double down on our existing highgrowth markets but the regulatory environments a little tough for that right now so weve updated our population map on page and if we were to do a market extension type of deal need to be in a similar highgrowth market like tennessee or texas but from a capital management standpoint i think were in a good spot with excess capital and weve got flexibility to use that capital we can deploy it in share repurchases we bought a little bit of shares back in the fourth quarter we could do a bond restructure or we could deploy it in ma stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah helpful commentary john thanks a lot guys appreciate the time john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of michael rose with raymond james your line is open south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to get some comments on slide which is the loan production chart obviously its come down since a very strong i know some of that is just your kind of conservative nature maybe not wanting to take on other peoples credits as they move out of the banks but just given your footprint just wanted to get some thoughts on loan growth expectations as we think about the year where are areas that you can maybe push the gas pedal a little bit and i would assume that some of the cre portfolios or some areas where youd be a little bit more cautious but i think youd previously kind of talked about a midsingledigit loan growth rate for next year so just wanted to get some context there thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah michael its john that graph is very interesting to me on page and we kind of had peak record production in the second quarter of and if you think back well what happened in the second quarter of thats when the fed started raising shortterm interest rates and precipitously after that youve seen a steady trend downward of production so the fed is getting what it wants for we guided to midsingledigit growth for the year and we ended at growth so given the uncertainty in the ph economies i feel like thats a very appropriate level of growth with where we are in the cycle pipelines for the end of the year are down considerably from where they were at the beginning of down about but even though the pipelines are slowing down michael theres kind of an embedded tailwind of loan growth because with rates where they are theres going to be slowing prepayments and theres continuing to be funding of loans that are unfunded that we made in so our guidance really hadnt changed we think midsingledigit growths reasonable and until rates decline but where do we see that growth for us weve seen a considerable amount of residential real estate growth in and were getting a nice coupon for that growth and theres just more people moving into our markets than there are homes available so i feel good about those credits from a asset quality standpoint cre activitys been very low in with the recent rise in rates you might see a little pickup there in with the fiveyear treasury down as much as it is and then weve just got a continuous push on the ci middlemarket space so thats an area that were leaning into so hope thats helpful michael michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very much so and then maybe just one for steve i think the stepdown in correspondent this quarter was a little bit greater than what some of us were kind of expecting i know theres typically kind of a seasonal rebound in the first quarter can you just kind of walk us through the dynamics there and i think you had previously kind of talked about a fee to average assets kind of in the basis point to basis point range any reason to think that that might be different as we progress through the thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure yeah thanks mike for the question yeah we on page is our fee income percentage and you can see that were million this quarter basis points of average assets and of course that was within our guide of we said at the low end of the basis points to basis points range in the fourth quarter just of what we saw were just kind of reiterating the same guidance for we would sort of expect a noninterest income to south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 average assets to be in the basis points to basis points for the full year its going to start on the lower end of the range like the fourth like we had in the fourth quarter for the first half of the year and probably the upper end of the range in the back half of the year and the reasoning for that is just sort of the yield curve normalizing and sort of our interest rate sensitive businesses like mortgage and correspondent they just perform better when things are a little bit more normal from that perspective so as you kind of take that into we would expect our noninterest income to average assets to return to that to basis points which was approximately the level so the way i kind of think about the variability in margin and our kind of our interestsensitive businesses is we need a little bit more yield curve normalization for those things to sort of get back to ill call it more normal levels so thats kind of how were thinking about it and like you mentioned correspondent with the and mortgage although mortgage was probably less volatile at this point but correspondent i dont think that probably if you think about the fixed income business until they start cutting rates thats probably not going to improve a lot our interest rate swap business because of the lack of loan volume in the industry in the fourth quarter probably in the first quarter its probably not going to ramp to the sort of the back half of the year as rates stabilize michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thats very helpful and then maybe if i can just squeeze one more in for john just reflecting on your comments at the beginning of the call around technology cost i think i was struck by how much the spend has increased in three years time or four years time up million as you think about going forward just conceptually any larger technology products or rehauls that you need to do or is it just more around the edges because thats a pretty big lift in cost in a couple years thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah sure i think our motto for was building a better bank and really was focused on the customer experience the employee experience and getting feedback from our team how to take friction out of the technology for its kind of finish the drill is the theme and its really the technology and process improvements that were already put in place the last couple years we just want to complete those projects so theres really not michael new significant technology platforms that weve got in the queue to update so i think the bulk of our technology spending increases is in the rearview mirror i mean theres always going to be growth in that category but nowhere near the level weve seen the last few years stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp hey michael this is steve the only other comment i would make is remember when we did the moe back four years ago that was one of the main reasons we did it there was investment in technology that we needed to make and so we used that period as an opportunity to take cost out of certain areas and reallocate it to the technology and so thats sort of been the story of the last several years michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc makes sense thanks for all the color operator your next question comes from the line of brandon king with truist securities your line is open south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp hi brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey so i appreciate the nearterm guidance on expenses but are you expecting expenses to kind of stay in that similar range throughout the year or kind of growth rate are you think is a good base case assumption william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah brandon thanks for the id say for the full year i think around that billion number is about what we would expect at this point there are of course some theres some components of compensation et cetera that fluctuate with revenue volumes and some of the fee businesses in particular that if that turns out differently than we expect those can move up or down but for the full year i think consensus said its right around billion and that feels like a pretty good spot based on what we see today brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and on fees with the cfpb overdraft proposal are you considering any particular changes to your overdraft policies and i guess if not what could be the potential impact if that does go into effect stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah brandon its steve we made some changes maybe to months ago we arent contemplating any new changes i know there was a new paper that came out a few days ago but as i understand it the earliest that would be approved is in october of so i think its probably just too early and of course were thinking about it but we havent run the math on any effect that would have on us for sure but anyway thats kind of how were thinking about it brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then lastly on deposit pricing i know cds continue to be a headwind near term but could you potentially quantify or give some context around nearterm cd repricing and then as youre looking and doing the numbers when could that potentially turn into a tailwind maybe either in or stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure brandon this is steve i think we have about billion of cds i think of that roughly come due in we have a fair amount coming due in the first quarter i want to say its not quite half but its a fair amount so as we think about repricing were just cds by nature or retail cds are generally pretty short in nature and we retooled a couple of our retail products to continue to shorten those up but the other ph day cds south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 only make up of our total deposits so itll be a little bit of a tailwind i think the exception probably from negotiated rates on the money markets is probably the place we put more liability sensitivity as we thought about it brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of samuel varga with ubs your line is open samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc i wanted to go back to the margin discussion just for a little bit just to clarify on the obviously im not digging too far into the and guides but just to clarify youre assuming that the mid to longer end of the curve is staying flattish ph at current levels so theres a steepness to the curve stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah if you look at the moodys consensus forecast i believe that today the all that fiveyear part which is where we put a lot of our assets is somewhere in the range i want to say by the end of its in that range give or take to sort of a flat curve by the time they cut indiscernible rates and so on so thats sort of our assumption for rates we dont see if the fiveyear part of the curve went up to of course our repricing would be stronger but we might have other issues and if the fiveyear goes down to the next year then theres probably other rate issues but anyway thats how john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp if you were saying that for the end of steve so there is at the end of is the moodys consensus a little higher than that isnt it stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 its a little higher than its somewhere between and i think and then by the end of its around so yeah but as you know at the end of october i think when we had our earnings call i think the fiveyear treasury moodys consensus was more like so it does move around for sure so well find out for sure samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you thats very helpful and then in terms of the down betas for what sort of assumptions do you have there for deposit down betas stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah let me take a bit of a longerterm view because theres always a lag in all of this but from our experience and from our modeling as i think about our betas i would say on the down betas its about total so for instance if i kind of run the math on were at fed funds rate and over the next couple of years they cut it to or basis points you would expect from our peak maybe basis points of pressure to be relieved coming back by and i know im not just talking about but it is a linear ramp and it takes time to do it but that would be really consistent if you kind of look back at our history look its a beta but theres always a little bit of a lag in that first couple rate cuts samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc that makes sense and then just a quick one do you happen to have the spot interestbearing deposit costs for december yearend stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp no we dont not here in front of me unfortunately samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc all right no problem thanks guys for taking my questions i appreciate it stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of russell gunther with stephens your line is open russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys just a couple quick clarifiers at this point the down beta youre contemplating that through the cycle and that would compare to the up beta of roughly did i hear that right south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah thats right russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc okay very good stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp and that would be the total russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc thank you and then stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp it would be total deposit betas russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc total yes stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc yeah okay excellent understood thank you and then just lastly as you guys kind of balance you mentioned the potential for a bond restructure versus buying back stock just kind of walk us through the thought process there and then if you could confirm any potential bond restructure that would get done would be likely accretive to that nim guidance for stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure russell its steve weve talked about that on the call i think it was last quarter we talked about it and i think its the same kind of calculus its really just trying to think about our uses of capital i think we talked up to maybe a ph maybe not more ahead than of our portfolio restructure and obviously wed be thinking about it in terms of earnback period less than three years thats how we would think about it its a lever were thinking about what were kind of just back to positioning the balance sheet thinking about the future if rates come down we are thinking about liability sensitivity a little bit and we want to think about how to position if rates do fall how to best position all the balance sheet and of course that takes time to do it but south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 weve been thinking about it for the last couple of quarters certainly we want to think about it for the next four or five so thats from a perspective of the bond restructure its certainly something on the table and to your point its a lever if they continue to have higher rates and our nim has some pressure thats a way that we can level set it but thats just on the restructure on the capital side william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah and as you noted i mean with the cet that does give us the luxury of considering more than one option and certainly share repurchases are a use of capital that we think about as well and where we sit today based on our forecasted riskweighted asset growth and capital formation rate if we dont do any of those things youre going to see that cet continue to climb from there so we like the flexibility weve got with our capital position today and well continue to think about all those options we mentioned russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc thats great guys i appreciate you taking my questions thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson your line is open gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp good morning gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co i wanted to ask about kind of the earning asset mix for you talked about i think flattish earning assets from the fourth quarter level of what looks like somewhere in the range of billion of net loan growth so from a funding perspective of that loan growth what are the cash flows indiscernible securities portfolio for the year and how lean would you run cash as youre thinking about kind of remixing the assets on the balance sheet a little bit stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure i guess its really i dont think its changed a whole lot as you think about if we have midsingle digit loan growth thats i dont know billion billion something like that we have our securities portfolio thats running off somewhere depending on rates million to million a year so that would imply that you have about to deposit growth assumptions built in there and we think its slow in the front end it probably ramps in the back end if you think about q3 and all that stuff that they end up bringing that back i would imagine south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 that liquidity in the system would get better in the back half but so just to make sure i was clear our average our expected average for the year of earning assets is billion our it will start out a little lower than that of course end up a little higher than that based on those assumptions gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay appreciate that and then just with the commentary in the press release with of the reduction in brokered deposits can you tell us what the brokered balances are at yearend stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah i dont have that in front of me but i think its around million million or so weve really brought that down over during the march banking situation we took it up billion just to make sure that we had plenty of liquidity ph fortressed balance sheet and then of course thats run off quite a bit over the year as i think about at least in the first half i certainly think well replace those and potentially grow it a little bit but itll be somewhere in that range historically we run about of average deposits so thatd be about s1 billion somewhere in that million to billion range i dont know somewhere in there thats typically how we run it depending on rates gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co great thanks very much operator there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call to john corbett for closing remarks john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp all right i know you guys have had a busy morning with a lot of calls so
