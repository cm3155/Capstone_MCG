you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call im going to provide remarks on our financial performance strategic execution and merger integration before turning over to glenn to review our financials in more detail the third quarter results announced today reflect a strong progress weve made in creating a highperforming and differentiated company through solid execution on ph integration activities and a laser focus on delivering for our clients we are ph one unified webster growing across a diverse set of business lines realizing revenue and cost synergies supporting the communities in an expanded footprint and delivering financial results that meet or exceed the target metrics we set forth when we announced ph the moe months ago our financial performance this quarter was stronger than ph last quarter on an adjusted basis we generated diluted eps of versus last quarter net income available to common shareholders million versus million last quarter and ppnr indiscernible million the ph potential of the company we have created is evident in our results on an adjusted basis we produced a return on assets in excess of and a return on tangible common equity of nearly our efficiency ratio was in the quarter an over 400basispoint improvement these results exceed the fullyear pro formas we provided when we first announced our merger in april we are surpassing loan growth expectations without expanding our risk tolerances were ph proactively optimizing the balance sheet weve continued to generate solid fee income weve done an excellent job of maintaining client service levels adding and retaining clients and talent while executing on the integration plan given the positioning of our balance sheet the nim ph expanded basis points to loans grew meaningfully this quarter driven indiscernible asset classes and geographies several of our major loan categories grew significantly including ci cre and residential mortgage deposits also grew just under while executing indiscernible cost synergies and approaching an efficiency ratio of we continue to make investments across the company we have said from the outset that webster post moe is a indiscernible we have been adding to commercial verticals indiscernible we had the opportunity to add middle market indiscernible national abl team we will continue to look for and make investments in colleagues and businesses that can grow our differentiated commercial business lines and that will generate deposits fees and loans and we look to maximize economic profit over time we will also continue to ph invest in technology that enhances colleague and client experience as we operate in an uncertain macro environment we continue to execute on asset growth while staying disciplined and prudent in the risk selection underwriting and portfolio management activities our credit metrics remain remarkably strong with lower npls and npas lower commercial classified loans and lower delinquencies all compared to prior quarter on both a percentage of portfolio and absolute basis while you will see the net chargeoffs were elevated from the prior quarter at a reported 25basispoint annualized approximately million of the net chargeoffs resulted from proactive balance sheet management and optimization through the sale of more than million worth of loans that were either no longer strategic or had suboptimal riskreturn ph metrics absent those portfolio actions the net chargeoff rate would be an annualized basis points more in line with q2 and still below our fiveyear indiscernible annualized range of basis points to basis points a quick recap on integration as i touched on a number of the items ph in the integration slide already we continue to integrate subledgers and systems ph underlying our core infrastructures combined our commercial credit risk management system and rolled out consolidated commercial pricing tools and we continued our corporate real estate consolidation where we are now complete major milestones we webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 anticipate in the fourth quarter include the consolidation of cloud data centers the transition of our consumer wealth and investment services operations to a thirdparty provider and by yearend all of our colleagues will have completed cultural activation sessions establishing a common foundation for our organization and aligning colleagues on strategy ph expected behaviors and most importantly the strong values that are at the foundation of webster bank with that im going to turn it over to glenn to review our financial performance for the quarter glenn i macinnes executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp thanks john and good morning everyone i will start with indiscernible reconciliation of core earnings on slide we reported gaap net income to common shareholders of million with eps of on an adjusted basis we reported net income to common shareholders of million and eps of each of which exclude onetime after tax expenses of million merger expenses were related to real estate consolidation ph severance and profession the strategic initiative expense is primarily a contribution to the webster foundation next ill review balance sheet trends before moving on to the income statement on slide at periodend total assets were billion with total loans of billion and total deposits of billion loan growth was predominantly driven by the commercial and residential portfolios deposits were up over million on a quarteroverquarter basis with both public funds and hsa contributing i will provide some additional color on the breakout later in the presentation loan growth was also funded ph in part with cash flow from the securities portfolio and shorter duration fhlb advances slide highlights ph the diversity of our loan growth by category a great illustration of the breadth of our promising ph business lines in total we grew loans billion or on a linked quarter basis growth was ph evenly balanced between categories with ci sponsor and commercial real estate all growing ph about million and residential mortgage growing million yield on the portfolio increased basis points excluding accretion the yield increased basis points a reflection of ph of the portfolio being floating or periodic switching to deposits on slide total deposit balances increased by million or increases in public funds and hsa drove the growth with the former up over million and hsa up million corporate deposits grew roughly million as we utilized a greater number of ph suite and other alternative sources of funds the total deposit costs increased basis points from basis points prior quarter our effective data was in the quarter and since the closing of the merger hsa cost of deposits were unchanged illustrating the value of the business in a rising rate environment a final note on hsa excluding thirdparty administrative accounts deposits grew million or yearoveryear additional detail on hsa bank is on slide in the appendix beginning on slide i will review the details of our income statement we provide our reported to adjusted income statement by line item and compare our adjusted earnings for second quarter significant growth in net interest income this quarter drove meaningful improvement in ppnr net income and eps on an adjusted basis ppnr was up million or net income was up million or and eps was up or i will cover the individual line items in more detail on subsequent slides the net interest margin was up basis points on a reported basis and our efficiency ratio was down basis points webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 on slide net interest income grew million relative to the prior quarter adjusting for accretion in both periods net interest income was up million this was an exceptionally strong result driven by growth and the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet excluding accretion the net interest margin increased basis points to and the earning asset yield was up basis points in the quarter also excluding accretion in addition to the trajectory of benchmark rates the increase in loan yields accelerated as the portion of our loan book that reprices is no longer impacted by floors as illustrated on the earlier slide the cost of deposits increased basis points quarteroverquarter while we anticipate deposit pricing increases in the coming quarters our nim should continue to grow given the attractive profile of our earning assets which reprice and originate at higher absolute rates on slide we highlight our fee income for the quarter on an adjusted basis fees were down million linked quarter and million yearoveryear the linked quarter decrease in fee income was driven primarily by lower levels of customer interest rate hedging activity and other transactional loan fees in commercial banking the yearoveryear decline was the result of lower direct investment and mortgage banking income slide summarizes noninterest expense we reported adjusted expense of million relative to prior quarter of million we continue to make progress on cost efficiencies related to the merger however this quarter included increased levels of performancebased compensation the yearoveryear decline of million is the combination of our cost save efforts todate offset by the increase in intangible amortization the bend acquisition and performancebased compensation slide highlights our allowance for credit losses which was up million over prior quarter after recording million in net chargeoffs we recorded million in provision expense with loan growth representing million of the increase and macro factors adding million on slide we highlight our key asset quality metrics on the upper left nonperforming assets declined million or quarteroverquarter likewise commercial classified loans declined million or net chargeoffs in the upper right totaled ph million or basis points of average loans on an annualized basis as john mentioned million of the chargeoffs were related to portfolio optimization activities without that net chargeoff rate would have been closer to basis points the allowance coverage declined modestly from to at periodend the allowance to nonperforming loan ratio increased times up from times last quarter coverage as a percent of commercial classified loans increased to from last quarter slide highlights our strong capital levels all capital ratios remain well in excess of regulatory and internal targets our common equity tier ratio remains strong at and is still above the mediumterm operating target of the tangible common equity ratio was the net of all capital effects this quarter resulted in a slight decline in our tangible book value per share which decreased to this was primarily driven by aoci valuation share repurchases and partially offset by strong earnings ill wrap up my comments with our outlook on slide we have narrowed our view down to the remaining quarter we expect gaap net interest income on a nonfte basis of million to million excluding accretion driven by our projection of a yearend fed funds rate of as well as continued loan growth this excludes million of scheduled purchase accounting accretion the details of which can be found on slide in the appendix for those modeling net interest income on an fte basis i would add roughly million to that measurement relative to last quarter our outlook implies full year net interest income excluding accretion of billion an increase of roughly million or from the outlook we provided last quarter webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 we expect loan growth for the quarter will be in the range of to given progress so far this year that would imply a growth of around since merger close relative to our original target of to fee income should be in the range of million to million which incorporates the impact of lower fees on the outsourced consumer investment business core expenses are expected to be in the range of million to million which includes increased performancebased compensation relative to our prior estimates on capital our overall philosophy is unchanged as we approach our mediumterm operating target organic growth opportunities will likely ph occupy a greater share of capital deployment and we will remain disciplined in evaluating opportunities to effectively deploy capital and lastly we are forecasting an effective tax rate of to with that ill turn things back over to john for closing remarks john r ciulla president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks glenn we recognize were operating at a time of uncertainty in the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape and that there are wider ranges of potential outcomes that could impact the operating environment we believe that our diversified and highquality businesses and loan and securities portfolios our healthy capital and loan reserve positions our credit and operating risk infrastructures and the quality of our colleagues all have us prepared to effectively navigate the macro environment ahead as i mentioned above we are being thoughtful in our loan risk selection and emphasizing strong underwriting and portfolio management processes i want to wrap up by emphasizing the outstanding progress weve made yeartodate and the momentum we expect to carry forward our commercial loans are on pace with growth this year as we pursue growth in businesses where we have a strategic advantage and the ability to be selective with respect to risk profile and return metrics our deposit franchise positions us particularly well relative to peers where our total cost of deposits increased just basis points relative to a 57basispoint increase in our earning asset yields excluding the impact of accretable yield we remain confident in our ability to fund future loan growth given our multiple deposit channels and our liquidity profile we expect we will continue to meaningfully benefit from interest rate increases and we have levers to pull in terms of capital allocation efficiencies and investment to maintain the current momentum well be sending out a save the date but we wanted to provide a headsup that our intention is to hold an investor day in new york city on march where youll have the opportunity to hear from our talented management team on our company and the goforward strategies and financial performance expectations for and beyond and finally thank you to my colleagues for their continued diligence and hard work as they execute on our core business initiatives while addressing the added challenge of integrating the new webster and i want to apologize i understand we had some technical difficulties at the beginning of the call and i thank you for bearing with us operator glenn and i will open it up to questions webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions operator instructions your first question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with keefe bruyette woods john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning thanks for the question maybe glenn the upgraded nii guide the million i guess very good update one of the trends weve seen this quarter is the narrative around peak nii wouldnt seem like thats the case given this but can you speak to growth from that fourth quarter level as you go into id be interested in your thoughts there thanks glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp sure great so let me just start ill talk a little about nim so just for texture i think our exaccretion or exit nim in september was and then i would think if you look at our q4 range id probably put that in the range again exaccretion of so we continue to see nim expansion as we look out into i think theres a couple of factors one is that our modeling were expecting peak fed funds in the second quarter of around ph million right and so given that dynamic and our beta which were forecasting again in like the low over the next four quarters we continue to see nim expansion now we see nim expansion going into the first quarter and then we see more modest nim expansion in the back half of the year so i think we still feel really positive about the prospects in the dynamic here is that even though we have higher deposit pricing which we are expecting our asset book is repricing more significantly christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great is the the low thats interestbearing or is that total glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp low christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc im sorry is that for all deposits or just interestbearing deposits glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah indiscernible im looking at the total deposit costs webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp and i would say lower christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp over the course of four quarters christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and then if i could the actions you took in the quarter to clean up credit could you just provide a little bit more color on that i think you said you i think theres a loan sale maybe i guess what prompted this could you consider more and i guess how should we be thinking about the confidence in credit going into the year john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah chris happy to talk about it and i think its important to talk about it i think it was less to clean up credit and more literally to kind of optimize our balance sheet going forward so weve talked publicly in the beginning that after diligence and closing the deal we liked all the businesses but that over the next four to six quarters from close as good stewards of capital we would continue to look at all of our businesses to see whether they remained strategic whether the risk return dynamics were strong whether or not there were any potential kind of credit weaknesses as we looked out over paradigm shifts and so we took the opportunity i mean think about it we grew loans around including the disposition of over million in assets and with the tailwinds from our asset sensitivity and the strong organic loan growth in key segments we thought it was a great time to take those actions and if you think about it again look at the total charges related to those actions over million the average sale price was like on the dollar so this certainly werent sale of distressed assets and there were note sales in there there were portfolio sales some to regulated banks so this was not kind of a cleanup of credit right in front of us but obviously in a higher expectation of spread environment theres an interest rate impact on the discount on the prices and there were some note sales of nonstrategic office for example that we thought now would be a good time to dispose of so we just thought it was a really smart move and obviously we think itll benefit us going forward as much from a return on equity perspective as from an ph avoid credit issue perspective christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great color i agree good move should we expect more into the end of the year or is this kind of a webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp i dont see anything right now so we dont have that in our guidance i dont think its going to be a reflection of what we do every quarter going forward we really like the businesses were in but obviously as we said well continue to look at the dynamics of the combined portfolios and so if there are opportunities that make sense from an economic perspective or give us more flexibility going forward or protect us from potential paradigm shifts in credit well do it but nothing thats in our sights christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks john john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey mark good morning mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co glenn i wondered if you could share with us whats the spot rate on deposits are today glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp sure i know that we ended the quarter i think were lets see i have that here so i would put it in the range of yes it might be say in the range of basis points to basis points mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then secondly just to kind of follow up on one of the earlier questions about credit i guess im curious how you guys are when you do your modeling how youre thinking about the provision line john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i mean mark as you know we think a lot about the provision line and we have a relatively conservative bias but that doesnt always factor in particularly with cecl and the way it works now so i would say at the high level and then glenn certainly feel free to fill in the dynamics this quarter were significant loan growth right webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 which requires a higher reserve the moodys scenario which us and many of our peers use was kind of worse right which requires in general directionally more reserves then you saw our credit stats which as i said i used the word remarkably not to brag just to be like surprising in this environment right that our npas and our classifieds were down materially so thats kind of a good guy if you will and then i will tell you that as im looking at the portfolio one encouraging kind of data point for me is that in each of the last three consecutive quarters the average weighted risk rating of our originations is actually better than on a material basis than the actual weighted average risk rating of the existing commercial portfolio translated into the fact that we are bringing on lower risk assets then we have each sequential quarter which ends up bringing down the overall weighted average risk rating which again would be a good guy so you saw those dynamics bigger loan portfolio more reserves worse forwardlooking economic scenario for moodys more reserves better asset quality metrics lower reserves and then higher quality originations lower reserves and thats kind of where we end up we feel really good if you look at our peers mark were still top quartile at least in terms of our reserve coverage ratios and im pretty pleased with where we are we also have a lot of capital so thats kind of the way im thinking about it glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah the only thing i would add to that mark is that john talked about the loan growth billion million provision against that and then if you look at the macro factors and we have million on the slide here theres really two things one if you just strip out the moodys impact and the fact that they slashed gdp estimates i mean thats probably million and sort of clawing that back is million so the net million are those two things and that million is really related to as john highlighted the improvement that we see in npls indiscernible classifieds et cetera and a weighted risk metric thats improving mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co great and lastly i wonder if you could give us sense for what your loan pipelines look like today and maybe also share with us what the commercial line utilization rates are john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah id say were still tracking ph all of the different lines i would characterize the line utilization as flat to slightly up not materially across all of our commercial businesses mark and im not sure what that evidence is i mean i think still solid demand but theyre not its not expanding at a crazy margin in abl for example which is usually a harbinger of faster working capital cycles i would say flat to marginally up the pipeline is relatively strong in certain sectors i kind of feel like well see a flattening of loan growth over the next couple of quarters in kind of core middle market areas we have seen some slowdown in the trading of real estate assets or in the sponsor book in terms of people selling companies and buying companies so that has an impact but if i look just at my pipeline report which obviously i did last night its robust and its similar as you see slightly above third quarter going into fourth quarter where theres usually a heightened amount of activity mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp hey mark before you go let me just clarify something i may have misunderstood the question on our deposit costs for the second quarter i think we exited like a basis points but on the fourth quarter were expecting that to be in the range of basis points to basis points just for clarification mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp sure john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks a lot mark operator your next question comes from the line of casey haire with jefferies casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah hey thanks good morning guys john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc how you guys are doing glenn just to clarify i think you meant you said third quarter it exited the quarter the spot rate for deposit costs ended basis points to basis points or you expect fourth quarter to end that way glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp well i said the third quarter right now were at basis points and as you go into the fourth quarter with our beta assumptions were probably in the range of basis points to basis points casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay thanks for clarifying all right so i was wondering about the funding strategy in the fourth quarter underlying your nii guide here so in the third quarter you guys kind of had a nice balance between a rebound in the muni deposits rundown on securities and a little bit of borrowings what is the outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond here webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah so great question so if you look at our loan guide and you say sort of take a right in the middle between and youll probably be at billion or something like that so lets just use that as a proxy i think that the thing thats really encouraging about the franchise is that and weve pointed this out a few times is that we have so many multiple levers of funding and liquidity sources thats really encouraging so as i look at funding going into the fourth quarter and even beyond some of the key drivers will be things like the continued runoff of our securities portfolio as we invest that in loans i think we have deposit growth in some of our commercial segments obviously hsa as we get toward the first part of next year and then we have a digital deposit gathering sources whether its brio whether its banking as a service things like that and then lastly from a liquidity standpoint we have plenty of sources of funds as far as funds that we can draw down on but that would be sort of the last thing we do so we continue to feel good about our funding ability casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay and the guide is predicated on another bps of fed hikes here what kind of upside is there i mean the forward curve is at ph million by yearend what kind of upside would there be if it plays out as the curve expects glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah i mean look were using our estimate right now of ph million obviously theres more upside indiscernible you could figure it out mathematically but i dont i guess the thing i would point out is the significance of our assets repricing and the slowness of betas coming around so i dont have that where our model has its peaking at ph million if theres upside to that that would be additive generally casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and just last one on the credit front so the million disposition was the sponsor and specialty finance book touched and just any color on the if my math is right there was about million of commercial losses outside of the disposition just any color on what was driving that john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah nothing in sponsor and specialty was disposed of and with respect to the core basis points that i reflected driven by two commercial credits casey one of which has been classified since prepandemic and finally capitulated neither of them were in the same geography asset class or kind of had anything that i would say is systemic in there i feel pretty good about basis points of chargeoffs at this point in the cycle so nothing to say except two unique credits that ended up having loss given defaults at the end of the day unfortunately casey haire q analyst jefferies llc understood thank you guys webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp thanks casey operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start on the deposit side so if we look at noninterestbearing deposit balances you actually had pretty decent growth in the quarter while banks everywhere are seeing outflows how did you buck the trend in the quarter and do you now expect to see outflows of those moving forward john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah steve obviously its relatively good news but were also pretty realistic about it there was some seasonal inflows from government deposits right and so our focus going forward is on making sure that as we kind of go through the next few quarters that our focus is on continuing where were growing loans to grow full relationships to grow commercial deposits obviously were going to get the benefit of hsa as we get to yearend in first quarter so i think we did it largely because weve got really sticky deposits in our retail franchise i think weve got really good commercial solid deposits with our relationships but i would have to say that a lot of the reason we were able to claim a deposit growth when there were outflows was a seasonal ph flowin from government deposits so as glenn said i think whats great right now about the way that our balance sheet is made up is we do benefit from the asset sensitivity significantly obviously were taking prudent measures to make sure whenever the time comes when fed funds rate comes down were protecting our cash flows but it does give us some pricing flexibility in key relationship areas on deposits and obviously were focused now on continuing to generate core deposits but weve got hsa weve got the direct bank in brio which is a higher cost deposit but nonetheless a deposit that we found to be stickier than we originally thought it would be and then weve got obviously all the diversified business banking commercial segments small business and retail so its going to be work and were continuing to focus on it right because if youre growing loans at the clip we are we need to make sure that were continuing to generate good sticky deposits going forward but well take the victory of growing deposits in the quarter but we also did benefit from government seasonality webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay john can you size that for us what was that benefit from the seasonal inflow from government deposits john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp well i think it was about glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp million steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc ph it was million okay thank you glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp quarteroverquarter right steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so then there was sort of a decline in the commercial i think we have indiscernible glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp and offset by some wholesale funding steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay i wanted to also ask so the loan to deposit ratios moved up quite a bit over the last few quarters where do you see that stabilizing glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so we feel good about operating in the high to range given the environment today so thats where i would expect it to be in fact as i look out over the next couple of quarters thats exactly where it is webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you okay thanks and then finally so regarding the acquisition of peoples this deal has attracted quite a bit of attention in connecticut particularly around the system conversion that didnt seem to go as planned how much of an opportunity is that for you right youre the bank i think of most that could benefit from whats going on there and have you seen any increase in client acquisition related to all the negative news on that thanks john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp steve you cant ask that you cant get me on that question i have such respect for that bank look weve talked about this in the past that its interesting in a lot of our key businesses we really dont overlap with peoples and we didnt overlap with peoples and we dont overlap with the combined mtpeoples there obviously have been some disruptions peoples bank clients are loyal because peoples is a really good bank there are opportunities obviously with colleague disruption there as well because thats not an moe its an acquisition and so there are opportunities from a personnel perspective and from a client perspective over time but as i said its a good bank and i wouldnt want to comment on specific opportunities steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay fair enough thanks for taking my questions glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp thanks steve operator your next question comes from the line of matthew breese with stephens inc matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp hey matt john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp good morning matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey john you alluded to this earlier just talking about maybe a softening of loan growth next year but i was hoping you could better kind of frame that for us i think historically youve always positioned the bank to be kind of a highsingledigit grower obviously indiscernible last few quarters have been better than that webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 how would you kind of frame for us what next year expectations are and then secondarily just a sense for current rate on the pipeline yeah ill leave it there john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah thats a great question and were sort of not changing guidance i think were to year in and year out this year i think weve been selective weve got a couple of categories that have really driven growth and i think were fortunate they tend to be categories with lower loss given default which im happy about in this cycle as i mentioned earlier to one of the questions our pipeline remains robust i think were going to have the ability and the luxury and i think many of our competitors will as well be a little bit more selective on rate and structure just given the fact that some of the nonbank lenders and their cost of funds and other dynamics are changing the nature of the marketplace so i still feel like when we made the announcement in april of one of the premises of the deal was that we on a combined basis could grow our commercial loans to year in and year out were obviously benefited by a bigger balance sheet and higher hold levels which weve talked about so even if the loan market and loan demand slows a little bit some of the niches and verticals and relationships that we have continue to enable us to grow loans so in our model were still looking at to loan growth next year regardless of kind of what the overall demand environment is and i believe we can do it safely we dont want jason on the call obviously because you never want your chief credit risk officer on the earnings call that generally portends to bad things but if he were here i think were able to kind of narrow our focus in resilient businesses stay away from things we think are more cyclical and continue to grow loans safely at to matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp and the only thing i would add to it is when you look at the quarter i think our originations were probably about and this is the third quarter at about ph right and so as we look out its probably going to be closer to the range of like ph to origination rate matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay and then could you just talk about digital deposits the balances between briodirect and then the banking as a service segment and how much of your funding projections should we be thinking rely on these buckets versus traditional ph street retail and commercial john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah matt sure and i think ive been pretty consistent in saying weve tried to lean in in those areas obviously brio is up running and proven and were able to generate some deposits there we did in the second quarter we did in the third quarter glenn can give you the number as it relates to banking as a service i dont know whether this is a pivot in narrative but in the second quarter i talked about the fact that we have three or four relationships that are live with a pipeline of about million to million of deposits but that we really didnt webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 factor in significant profitability or contribution nor did we factor in significant investment in the banking as a service space i think the update there is things are a little slower than we thought luis and i continue to kind of narrow our focus in those areas where we think we can drive core deposits and drive kind of liquidity were not factoring in significant funding from the ph bas channel over the course of so were not relying on that in our model that would be upside gravy with respect to brio we do expect to have that as part of our arsenal and maybe glenn you can indiscernible glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah sure so i think just to start like digital direct is probably about billion right now ph and so with the biggest driver of that being brio but as you know brio is like more of a higher beta type product but it is a lever that we have that we can get good funding and as long as were turning ph it into the loans in the range of to thats a pretty good funding source so i think brio is one channel that we have that we can pull the lever we can adjust that pretty quickly and then as john mentioned the banking as a service and stuff like that but more importantly i think besides securities portfolio running off we expect to have deposit growth in commercial segments hsa as you know will come in in the first quarter thats the enrollment period so we should see a pop on the hsa as well so theres again i keep coming back to it because i think its really unique for us is that we have so many multiple sources of funding that will continue to distinguish us and certainly its playing out in our financial forecast matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay thank you and then last one for me just going back to the loan sale i think theres been some lingering questions on whether or not there were areas of the sterling portfolio that would eventually be exited or continue to be part of the story did the loan sale have anything to do with kind of legacy sterling ancillary segments and if so what were those john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah im not going to talk specifically i think the overall theme is both banks had kind of suboptimal riskreturn businesses and as we work through them as a billion bank now we have the opportunity to decide whether or not we can either accelerate and correct and improve businesses or decide to exit so i guess im trying not to be ph too mad i think the answer is kind of not specifically related to legacy sterling but related to the entire organization there are suboptimal portfolios that kind of weve looked at and moved through we were able to kind of act on everything we identified in the quarter as things where we didnt think we were going to be able to get return for the appropriate risk or as i said on a couple of select note sales in key areas where there may be paradigm shifts like office we were able to kind of lighten our exposure so im going to leave it at that and i dont think its a worry i mean you characterize it as kind of like a worry but there are subscale and suboptimal businesses that we will over time figure out whether or not we want to accelerate or whether we want to exit and whether that exit is a loan sale or just as a wind down of the business thatll happen over time but right now we love the portfolio of assets we like the credit quality a lot in the entire bank when you bring all the portfolios together webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay thats all i had thanks for taking my questions john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo securities timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is timur braziler filling in for jared john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey guys maybe just starting on the bond book and using that as a source of funds does that slow with the expectation that loan growth slows and does that pretty much end in the first quarter as the hsa seasonality kicks in i guess whats a good kind of base we should be thinking about for the bond book glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so i think you would continue to see first of all it has extended with the rise in rates so our cash flow has come down a little bit but still for the quarter if youre using something in the range of like million i think thats pretty good right so thats how i would generally model it but we continue to reinvest what came off in the third quarter is like million that came off at right so if we can reinvest that in loans you can see the spread indiscernible right and so well continue to do that as a source of funding for loans going forward john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp did you have a second part to that question timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc oh just with hsa coming on in the first quarter and that being used as a funding vehicle john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc is that kind of slow john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp no i mean timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc in or is that the strategy that will be used in as well john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i mean i think weve talked about this but i think if you look at the total book at billion we sort of think of it as part of it is that the deployment of the excess liquidity we had back a couple of quarters ago and so thats done well for us from an earnings standpoint but its always been our attention to sort of move that into the loan book and pick up basis points or now basis points in doing so so even with hsa coming in in the first quarter given our loan growth for the year i think thatll still be a good source of funding for us timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then maybe just bigger picture on the sterling integration i mean the results post deal closing have already been quite strong integration is still kind of slated for middle of next year what changes once that integration is complete is that just youll be able to take out some more expenses or do you expect to see some operational gains kind of in how lending or deposit generation is being conducted john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah thats a really interesting question i think it wont have a material impact on our ability to generate revenue right one of the things we talked about with this transaction is the complementary nature and again i always harp on this and ill take the opportunity to do it again is that a lot of times when moes dont deliver either in time or they dont deliver ever its not because of the cost saves this wasnt a cost save deal only of the combined cost save no banking center consolidation out of the gate right it was really about the fact that we were able to put two banks together where everyone could continue focusing on their customer because there was virtually no overlap from a retail business banking or commercial perspective and i think thats proven out so when we get the technology integration and conversion done next july i dont think that signals our addition to accelerate revenue except to your point of having maybe a more resilient and scalable operational platform but for us what it will do is we will finally get to retire one of two core systems well kind of finally get to retire several commercial subledgers and make us more efficient over time so we do feel like our operational effectiveness will be better our operational efficiency and our cost structure will certainly go down and thats one of the things were excited about youve seen obviously inflationary pressures on the industry throughout we still have another months to months of the ability to offset some of the pressures of inflationary expenses on wages and other things by the fact that we still havent consolidated three call centers we still havent fully gotten webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 to our conversion on our core systems so all of that should give us kind of more flexibility from an expense perspective i dont think itll change the trajectory of revenue growth timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then just last for me more of a modeling question the scheduled accretion guide of million in do you have any visibility as to what accelerated accretion in the quarter could be just kind of looking at the delta between third quarter accretion and the fourth quarter guide and i guess for the third quarter accretion was any of that component driven by the million of loan sales that kind of drive any of the accelerated accretion component there glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp no i mean this is generally its prepayments i mean accretion is down obviously quarteroverquarter but therell be volatility look when we announced and put in the you see the impact of purchase accounting back on page in the slide that was just based on scheduling and obviously as customers prepay and stuff like that thatll accelerate right i think theres probably about maybe its a smaller amount its probably to due to the loan sale in that accretion ph however its not meaningful timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay but looking at the i guess its hard to look at the paydown schedule but should we be assuming a similar level kind of of accelerated accretion in the fourth quarter or is that glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp oh we gave it to you we laid it out for you there its like on the loan side its ph billion right and thats our best estimate right now indiscernible it could change based on prepayment activity and stuff like that timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it great thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp thanks operator your next question comes from the line of laurie hunsicker with compass point webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah hi thanks john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey laurie laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp good morning laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc aoci what was that intangible common equity this quarter on a dollar basis glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp without aoci laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc no no just what was the aoci drag in the intangible common equity glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so the aoci in the third quarter impact was its million right thats after tax so thats an increase of about million quarteroverquarter laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc perfect perfect okay great and then john and glenn just going back to the million sale and i appreciate you dont want to break out with legacy webster versus legacy sterling how much of that was office and then kind of what were the other larger components in there and then just a refresh on office right we have last quarter you gave us it was billion of which million was in new york or nyc i guess proper do you have a refresh on what that is as of thanks john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp sure sure im happy to do that so the impact on our office exposure between the asset sales and other just general amortization and payoffs is about million so were million lighter on total office exposure than webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 what we had walked through and ill refresh those numbers for you in a second and the rest of the stuff related to kind of general ci activity in terms of the million so general ci businesses i would say that to refresh office if you recall theres not really a material change except for the million or so reduction so we talked about billion in total office exposure about a little over million of which was kind of stabilized medical office which has a much better operating profile and i think is not subject to paradigm shifts that would impact traditional office so if you take that billion remaining roughly about half of it is class a the other half is class bc which is what were focused on the most so again take maybe of the asset sales youre down to about million in terms of bc office exposure the total new york city office exposure in the five boroughs is around million that remains largely unchanged and thats about split a and then b and c we havent seen really a change in the underlying risk ratings or classified contents there although were not taking our focus off of it and obviously evidenced by the fact that some of our discrete note sales were in that category laurie but also again reminding you that we sold all of those loans at a combined rate of on the dollar we werent selling loans with identified loss content were just making decisions to kind of eliminate nonstrategic assets that over time could have lower value laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc got it okay and just so that im clear i had in my notes last quarter million was new york city thats now down to million john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp let me check maybe its oh i think medical is also in that laurie so nonmedical office in new york around million operator and at this time there are no further questions john r ciulla president chief executive officer director webster financial corp great thank you very much for joining us today and have a wonderful day operator this concludes todays conference you may now disconnect webster
