passion and commitment to rebuild and return to a level of normalcy shifting to our third quarter financial performance were extremely proud of the accomplishments and results we released earlier today this was driven by continued solid loan growth and strong margin expansion coupled with excellent credit metrics and a efficiency ratio in evaluating yeartodate performance i believe the third quarter is indicative of the year strong loan growth ongoing deposit pricing discipline and prudent expense management have resulted in very strong net income and ppnr growth for the year however we know there continues to be economic uncertainty ahead therefore we will prioritize and remain resilient around the key safety and soundness components including capital liquidity and credit nonetheless with the continued strong performance of our core businesses as well as our new initiatives which will begin to generate income we feel certain we will perform well through this cycle and reach the other side as a stronger more diversified company consistent with our longerterm top quartile objectives synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 let me provide a brief update on some of our new initiatives as i know jamie will cover our core business performance story as he shares the quarterly financials maast our bankingasaservice platform continues to progress with beta testing of our first integrated software provider client in fact we expect to add a second client to beta testing in the fourth quarter and remain focused on an early official launch with a pilot solution in place were enhancing testing functionality and capabilities throughout the remainder of the year while we strengthen the product offering and expand the pilot into other b2b segments we continue to recruit top talent to prepare for the launch and build out phases and of the product offering we remain committed and confident to this opportunity and our teams are working diligently to ensure we deliver a differentiated product early next year in addition we announced last week we continue to build out our corporate and investment banking team with coverage and credit product leaders onboarded for our healthcare services vertical as well as our ph leader for debt capital markets weve also closed our first transactions in the technology media and communications as well as the financial institutions verticals with all of our vertical leads now in place we expect to accelerate adding new business in the months and quarters ahead we continue to make investments in our treasury and payment solutions that will serve as new sources of revenue and well roll out new analytical capabilities in the consumer business in the fourth quarter that will provide opportunities to strengthen and deepen existing relationships we also continue to be pleased with one of our newest industry verticals our restaurant specialty group with million in loan growth this quarter this brings the portfolio to million im also happy to announce that we raised our base wage to per hour in the third quarter which we feel will offset some of the inflationary pressures felt by our team members and ensure we have a competitive compensation structure to continue to attract and retain talent overall i believe we continue to execute exceptionally well on our strategic plan this success is directly attributable to our 5000plus team members who serve our clients and internal partners with a purpose this continued focus on execution allows us to perform at a high level regardless of the underlying economic conditions i am truly humbled and proud of what you do every day let me turn to slide and our financial highlights for the quarter net income yearoveryear was up led by total revenue for the third quarter of million an increase of yearoveryear and quarteronquarter the revenue increase was driven by nii growth a result of continued healthy loan growth and a 27basispoint expansion in net interest margin ppnr was million for the quarter an increase of yearoveryear representing the highest level seen in over years this performance led to adjusted eps of return on average assets of and return on tangible common equity of as well as an efficiency ratio of all representing excellent operating metrics which serves as validation of the teams continued execution loans increased billion or quarteroverquarter with diversified growth across all segments commercial loans again served as the primary driver of growth it is reaffirming to see loan growth in all of our business units again this quarter leading to our fifth consecutive quarter of doubledigit loan growth deposits declined quarteroverquarter driven by balanced diminishment and ratebearing balances as we have shared previously our clients continue to maintain average balances that are higher than prepandemic synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 levels however during the third quarter we saw a decline in average balances as clients utilized their cash in businessrelated investments and commercial and consumers sought higher return alternatives despite the diminishment net production has continued to increase and we remain focused on our efforts to grow deposit relationships over time our underlying credit performance continues to trend positively as our npa npl and criticized classified ratios remain stable and quarterly chargeoffs dropped to historically low levels as we have noted before the performance of our loan book is a function of portfolio diversification and a strict adherence to our disciplined credit framework we remain cautiously optimistic on the nearterm outlook for credit lastly capital ratios remain consistent quarteroverquarter representing both our strong earnings and our focus on deploying capital to client loan growth now ill turn it over to jamie to continue the overview of our quarterly results in greater detail jamie andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin id like to begin with loan growth as seen on slide total loan balances ended the third quarter at billion reflecting growth of billion on an annualized basis excluding the impact of ppp this represents a growth rate of our fifth consecutive quarter of annualized doubledigit loan growth once again this growth was broadbased with contributions from wholesale community consumer and cib business funds growth was led by cre which increased million quarteronquarter this was a function of loan production paired with a slowdown in payoff velocity slower levels of payoffs relative to those experienced in the first half of the year contributed approximately million to cre growth in the quarter growth was once again led by the multifamily and medical property sectors which represent the highest levels of credit quality within the cre segment with regards to ci growth was led by the wholesale line of business in addition increased utilization from ci commitments existing at the end of the second quarter contributed approximately million to quarterover quarter growth consumer loan balances increased million driven by mortgage and home equity lending thirdparty consumer loan balances remain flat quarteroverquarter as weve communicated previously we leverage our thirdparty consumer portfolio as a means to complement our overall balance sheet positioning and as we look forward we expect to redirect pay downs within that portfolio to support our core growth opportunities turning to slide the third quarter saw a continuation of the industrywide headwinds for deposit growth with our deposit balances declining quarteronquarter these declines were a result of a host of factors including the pressure from high rate nonbank alternatives as well as disciplined deposit pricing deposit production remained strong in q3 our focus remains on what we can control and that is continuing to work to grow deposits both from existing relationships and new business initiatives which over the longterm should be the basis for value creation for all of our stakeholders as we look at deposit rates our average cost of deposits increased basis points in the third quarter to that compares to an average of for the month of september which equates to a total deposit beta of approximately for this cycle using average rates for the month of september this is lower than the total deposit beta we previously estimated in july for a scenario in which policy rates reached current levels the synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 existing variance appears to be attributable to the recent pace of interest rate hikes and the associated lags in deposit repricing while this unprecedented tightening cycle is creating an uncertain environment for rates and deposit pricing if the fomc continues to tighten to the area on policy rates as implied by the recent dot plot we would expect some further upward pressure on total deposit beta for the cycle placing it in the range of to now on to slide the combination of disciplined deposit pricing continued strong loan growth and interest rate increases in the third quarter serve to support significant growth in net interest income which came in at million an increase of yearoveryear or quarteroverover the net interest margin was in the third quarter an increase of basis points from the second quarter as shown in the nim waterfall the impact of higher shortterm rates boosted loan yields as greater than of our loans are now floating rate higher loan yields were partially offset by higher deposit and wholesale funding cost as we look forward the pace of nii growth will be impacted by the timing of deposit repricing interest rate policy and loan growth we expect nii to be driven primarily by balance sheet expansion and ph long end repricing as we move past this rate hiking cycle slide shows total adjusted noninterest revenue of million up million from the previous quarter and down million yearoveryear our depth of relationships and stability in core banking fees and wealth revenue act as a source of strength despite volatile capital markets and a continued depressed residential mortgage environment notably wealth revenue grew despite a yearoveryear decline in the equity markets this highlights the diversity of the nonbank nonmarketbased revenue streams within our wealth segment in areas such as trust and family office in addition wealth revenue was benefited by fees generated from clients movement into short term investments such as repos this is further evidence of the pressure put on deposits in q3 from nonbank shortterm liquidity alternatives moving on to expenses slide highlights total adjusted noninterest expense of million up million from the prior quarter and up million yearoveryear which represents a increase employment expense increased yearoveryear primarily attributable to the impacts of merit elevated performance incentives and team member additions as mentioned earlier we increased the minimum wage to per hour this increase and other related compensation changes will result in additional spend of million in the fourth quarter and an increased annual spend of approximately million similar to previous quarters when segmenting our yearoveryear increase in expenses the majority of the growth is attributable to performancerelated costs and investments in new business initiatives such as cib and maast we expect expenses associated with these new growth initiatives and infrastructure investments to increase million to million in the fourth quarter our third quarter efficiency ratio of is evidence that we are effectively managing our expense base while making these strategic investments moving to slide on credit quality our credit performance and the credit quality of our recent originations remained strong the npa and npl ratios remain stable overall and are at or near historically low levels at synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 and respectively the net chargeoff ratio was for the quarter representing the lowest chargeoff rate we have seen in recent years in the second quarter our acl was million or of loans given continued elevated strong loan growth the acl increased million quarteronquarter while the acl ratio remained relatively flat this ratio reflects the quality of the loan portfolio offset by a more negative economic outlook although we do believe that a more challenging economic environment could impact credit performance metrics we are confident in the composition and strength of our loan portfolio we have emphasized diversification and specialization across several facets of our commercial lending lines and we have been targeted and selective in the sectors and industries in which we win lastly our primefocused conservatively underwritten consumer portfolio is well positioned for a potential downturn as noted on slide the common equity tier ratio remained relatively stable at within the quarter core earnings supported robust capital generation which was largely redeployed back into prudent balance sheet growth i would highlight that this is the fourth consecutive quarter of stable capital ratios near the midpoint of our to range a result which is evidence of our focus on diligently managing our capital position consistent with our internally established targets looking ahead to the fourth quarter our focus remains on prioritizing capital deployment toward our core growth opportunities the slower pace of loan growth expected in q4 will likely result in a year end cet1 within the upper half of our to range in light of the uncertain economic environment we believe further supporting our capital position in the upper half of the range makes sense and similar to this quarter we do not expect any further share repurchases in ill now turn it back over to kevin kevin s blair president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you jamie ill now continue with our updated guidance for the quarter as shown on slide we remain on track to deliver our pledged million of pretax synovus forward benefits by the end of this year at the end of the third quarter our annual revenue run rate stood at over million and the continued execution of our efficiency and growth initiatives will result in benefits in excess of our stated target synovus forward is now embedded in a continuous improvement mindset that will continue long after this initiative is formally complete especially as we continue to operate in more volatile economic conditions as a result of our strong loan growth of in the third quarter we are raising our total year loan growth exppp guidance to approximately which implies fourth quarter loan growth tapering a bit from the growth levels delivered in q3 this loan growth combined with a fed funds target rate of to by the end of the year results in total expected annual revenue growth excluding ppp revenue of to and on the expense side we are expecting yearoveryear adjusted expense growth of to a result of incentives and costs tied to strong performance and targeted business investments and as weve stated previously our employee incentive structures are tightly aligned with overall performance and as such the strong forecasted revenue performance this year has resulted in higher incentive expectations synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 given the strong positive operating leverage resulting from this years performance our expectations for year overyear adjusted ppnr growth exppp is now to i am pleased with the progress we continue to make as an organization and remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable top quartile performance is shaping up to be an outstanding year in terms of our financial performance one that fully exceeded our original and most recent expectations reflecting back on our investor day in february i could not be more pleased with our progress we stated that we had to increase productivity deepen client relationships and deliver ongoing efficiencies while leveraging strategic investments to create an elevated growth profile we have increased productivity in loans deposits and assets under management production during the year deepened relationships utilizing analytics and good oldfashioned partnerships managed expense growth by closing branch locations and maintained progress on our new initiatives matching our actions with our promises in a manner our team has in is even more impressive given the volatility in the economy and many causes from which it stems going forward we will adjust and alter our path where necessary as we remain agile in navigating the ever changing economic and competitive landscape i want to again thank our 5000plus team members you are the secret to our success and your efforts and contributions are not unnoticed by our leaders clients or key stakeholders and now operator lets open the call for qa question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question for today comes from brady gailey from kbw brady your line is open kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so when i look at your capital with the aoci impact your tce continues to move down here its now but if you look at common equity tier its still at a great level at but theres such a differential between those two ratios as the tce continues to move lower is there any impact to synovus from that synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp brady its jamie good morning as we think about capital ratio we primarily focus in on cet1 and the reason for that is look at the impact to tangible common equity of aoci is basically a timing difference and only a partial story of whats happening as a result of interest rates as youre well aware synovus performs better in a higher rate environment but when you marktomarket components of the balance sheet like the securities portfolio you can see theres parts of it where the value declines whereas there are many more parts where the value increases and so as we think about capital and how we manage our balance sheet how we protect the balance sheet we primarily focus in on cet1 and regulatory capital and as you can see by our earnings today and our strategy for the rest of the year its our intent to build capital through the rest of the year retain earnings and build capital in dollar form you can see that were deploying it to clients which is our key strategic objective and we expect to continue that through year end brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right and then jamie can you give us a little more color on the swaps that synovus has added over the last year or so i think as of the end of the second quarter it was a little over billion ph received fixed paid floating can you just help us think about the impact that those swaps have on earnings and if they have any impact on capital like from a marktomarket point of view and any changes that may have happened in that swap portfolio in andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah its a great question and you did see a little bit of change in the swap portfolio in the third quarter but its not what you would normally expect it was more tied to hedging debt or deposits broker deposits and so when i think about the core swap portfolio swaps against our loan portfolio it remained stable and what we have right now is we have about billion of exposure thatll mature over the next few years and it will be impactful to earnings its not impactful to regulatory capital but it is impactful to what we were just discussion on tangibles when we think about the impact to earnings going forward unfortunately the maturities are somewhat lumpy and so therell be some quarters where we have more maturities than others and those maturities will be a benefit to the following quarters nii the biggest quarter that we have coming up with maturities would be the second quarter and we have approximately billion of maturities at around a received fixed rate and so thatll be accretive to nii in once those mature but it will be lumpy and it will come in over the next few years brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks for the color synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah thanks brady operator thank you our next question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan steven your line is now open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start on the deposit side so prior to ph q3 noninterest bearing deposits were about of the deposit base now theyre around how should we think about pressure on noninterest bearing balances from here right will it get worse than what we just saw this quarter and ultimately are we headed back towards andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hi steven this is jamie ill jump in first we spend a lot of time thinking about that and we think about our nib as a percent of total deposits we believe that they will be relatively stable maybe decline a few percent as we go through this cycle and the reason we believe that is one weve seen strong client growth and so our relationship managers out in the field are bringing on new clients theyre driving that business and we believe that over the longterm thatll lead to sustained growth but then on a more technical side we also looked at prior cycles and so we looked at the cycle in the early and if you look at dda during that cycle you did see some declines it was about but then when you look at the cycle from to dda as a percent of total deposits did not decline and so we think that that also gives us a little bit of comfort that you may see some slight declines in that percentage but were not expecting anything outside of those prior cycles kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp and steven ill just add interesting enough when you look at noninterestbearing deposits relative to core deposits they actually increased this quarter from to and so as weve seen money market attrition weve actually had dda hold on better than some of the rateseeking clients that have moved to other instruments synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 to jamies point i think the great opportunity that we have in front of us is what weve been doing for the last three years in terms of investing in treasury and payment solutions so when you ask yourself why would someone keep their money in a noninterestbearing account theyre doing that because theyre receiving services from our treasury and payment solutions team and theyre offsetting that with their earnings credit rate but as we continue to grow our commercial business our ability to win business as jamie suggested in that commercial space is very high and will actually continue to accelerate and so as we continue to improve our products and solutions we have the opportunity to have outsized growth in new production of dda which could help to mitigate any diminishment that we would see going forward steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc if we stay with that as my followup so this quarter you saw a very nice nim expansion but i mean the question were asking everybody is whats the trajectory from here seems like for most banks is going to be somewhat similar to but does your nim then peak it sounds like a lot of banks are guiding to nim peaking in the first half of next year and then the wildcard is can you hold it at that level or jamie you talked about this pickup in deposit betas ph with a lag does it trend down in the second half how are you thinking about that from a high level here thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah steven this is the key question as we look at it first were really pleased with what the team delivered in the third quarter i think that our performance on managing deposit calls managing the balance sheet was strong and it led to a strong quarter of nii and so we are really pleased with that and when we look forward and this is embedded in our total revenue guide for the full year the midpoint of that is an expectation that nii will be relatively stable in the fourth quarter from these elevated third quarter levels and thats a combination of youll see some of the impact of prior rate hikes on deposit calls in the fourth quarter and were expecting obviously further rate hikes from the federal reserve there are potential tailwinds to that which would be the liquidity environment and what happens outside of the banking industry but that could also be a headwind and so we will see as we go through the fourth quarter but to your real question beyond that we would expect to see an nii and a margin headwind from deposit pricing lags once the fed tightening cycle is over and that will be a nearterm impact for us i believe as we look forward further out that will be offset by the benefit of fixed rate asset repricing i mentioned derivatives maturities earlier also the repricing of the securities portfolio also the repricing of our mortgage portfolio i mean its a little more than billion of fixed rate exposure thatll reprice over time and thatll be a nice tailwind for us so when i think about nii we think that the fourth quarter should be relatively stable to the third quarter but looking out beyond that when we look at and well give full year guidance in january but when we look at the longer term we do believe that the benefit of fixed rate asset repricing will fairly offset the negative impact of deposit lags and we may see nii in approximate loan growth yearoveryear synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc terrific thanks for taking my questions kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you steven operator thank you our next question comes from jennifer demba of truist securities jennifer your line is now open jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc obviously your asset quality was terrific this quarter can you talk about any signs of normalization youre indiscernible any different portfolios robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp oh hi jennifer its bob just real quick yeah thanks for the question but i think where we sit today were benefiting from the liquidity that was in the system through the pandemic you look at our chargeoff ratio over time go back to maybe to when we were in the to basis point range and then as we went through the pandemic obviously it got on a pretty direct slope downward and were kind of leveling off here at fairly low levels we would anticipate that you would see a return to something in that range as we go forward my only caveat to that would be if we remain in a restrictivetype policy for a longer period of time certainly we would expect credit cost to continue to perhaps move up to another range or a higher level as of today however we just arent seeing the migration we arent seeing the defaults we arent seeing significant changes in modification request etcetera so right now my bias is towards stable but certainly looking ahead we could expect some headwinds there as it relates to credit jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay great and kevin could you talk about the cib business and where it is today versus your expectations maybe earlier this year in february during the investor day synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah jennifer i think its exciting to see now that we have all three of our managing directors that are leading our verticals in place and with the talent as weve shared in the past weve been very excited about the talent were bringing on and being able to recruit talent from some of the larger institutions and now we have some credit product specialists debt capital markets and were starting to see deals being booked and we had two deals as i mentioned in the prepared remarks this quarter our pipeline is over million and whats great about that jennifer is its not just about participating in deals we have some lead opportunities in front of us and i give tom deardorff and his team a great deal of credit in that theyve been able to attract top talent that have hit the ground running so im more indiscernible than i probably was even last quarter just because were starting to see traction were winning deals the pipelines are building bob has brought in a credit team to support them which we think has been an incredible help to the team in terms of prospecting so im more optimistic today you may ask the question how would we think about it going forward in an economic recession i wouldnt think differently about it i think the team we have in place today will continue to provide great credit opportunities and be able to crosssell depository and treasury opportunities even in an economy thats not growing as fast so for me im just happy we have another lever for our growth engine as we think about the future with the market slowing potentially with a potential recession jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc can i ask one more question about loan growth you said itd be slowing in the fourth quarter is that because youre being more selective now with a more uncertain economy or are you seeing the pipeline slowdown from here kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah jennifer its a really good question as we think just first talked about this quarter when you think about billion in loan growth we saw fairly stable production we also saw payoffs and pay downs slow considerably predominantly in the cre space and so that contributed a little extra growth as we saw the payoff activity slow down as we look out into the fourth quarter we are seeing some slowing in activity from our clients pipeline pipelines are down from where they were in the third quarter so when you think about just a reduction in production that would produce somewhere around a million to billion loan growth for the quarter now the variables there will continue to be what happens with the payoff activity and ultimately what happens with the utilization this quarter we saw only 20basispoint increase in utilization and on the same line increase about million so it will slow a bit but the wildcard there is what will happen with payoff activities but yes production is slowing just a little bit synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks so much operator thank you our next question comes from brad milsaps from piper sandler brad your line is now open brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp morning brad kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co thanks for taking my questions jamie maybe i wanted to start with expenses i appreciate you guys had a great revenue year and obviously the incentive comp has drifted up just curious because of the great revenue have you in your mind been able to pull forward any expenses maybe from make any additional investments that maybe could soften some of the inflationary pressure that were seeing across the industry i know youre not giving guidance but just kind of curious if you in your mind kind of brought any of that forward to kind of ease maybe andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp its a great question but on the expense side i would say we have two things going and this will be our story for as well is we have core expenses which is how we operate our existing business and then we have the spend for the future with our strategic growth initiatives but when you look at our core expense base its very wellmanaged and you see strong performance yearover year you see active management but were not stopping or not spending we are not stopping spending when we need to clearly this is an inflationary environment you saw we just announced our minimum wage increasing to an hour were actively out there ensuring that were competitive that we have the right compensation structures to have the strongest team out there in the southeast and so we feel really good about what weve been doing on todays expenses and thats what should you expect to see for us in active management of what we can control ensuring that were doing everything we can to build the best team maintain the best team synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 but then also our stated plan is made for through the cycle this is clearly an uncertain economic environment but if you look at our strategic plan what we laid out on february 8th remains the same as what were saying today these are all longterm plans that we believe position us for the future brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thank you and as my followup jamie it looked like average longterm debt went from maybe just under million to billion on the average balance sheet and i know some of these categories are lumped together but you finished the quarter with almost billion of longterm debt can you i know there was a small issuance in august but just kind of curious what you did there maybe how its structured rate term etcetera just kind of want to indiscernible kind of the moving parts to make sure i didnt miss something there andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah brad what youre seeing there is largely home loan bank advances now those are considered longterm but theyre floating rate indiscernible debt and when you think about those funding costs i would just think about that as basically a fed funds funding or sofr shortterm sofr rate funding brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co got it thank you i was a little confused considering the longterm data okay appreciate the clarity thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yep operator thank you our next question comes from kevin fitzsimmons of da davidson kevin your line is now open kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co hey good morning everyone just dovetail a little on brads question there just curious jamie how we should i know there was a question earlier about noninterestbearing deposits but just your outlook for overall deposit levels going forward do we continue to see a modest decline and im assuming more modest decline going forward versus third quarter and then do you continue to offset that with the borrowings you were just referring to and more broadly how you feel about that loantodeposit ratio which i think now has gone up to where that stands relative to where you want to be longer term thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah kevin as we look forward on deposits you can see in our loan guide where were forecasting as kevin mentioned earlier strong growth in the fourth quarter and we are expecting and look this is a highly uncertain environment on the deposit front but we are expecting to see deposit growth in the fourth quarter synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 now itll be likely slower growth but we are expecting to see growth in the fourth quarter and expect thats our current baseline weve seen grow quartertodate we expect to maintain that through yearend when you think about the loantodeposit ratio if you look back over the longer term we have run for years in the upper to loantodeposit ratio its not our intent to get back to those levels in the mediumterm but you should expect to see that increase and so we will look to use all of the liquidity levers that we have but you should expect to see that increase one of those liquidity levers that i would highlight is our thirdparty lending portfolio clearly youve seen strong client growth from us for five consecutive quarters and it is our intent it has always been our intent to use that thirdparty portfolio as a source of liquidity and so you should expect to see that ph trade over time given the strong client loan growth kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp and kevin given the topic i told jamie id want to jump in on deposits obviously i think its important to understand what happened in the third quarter to be able to project whats going to happen in the future and our teams done a good job of looking at the outflows this quarter about of our declines our diminishment this quarter were a function of just seasonality we had another where our customers were deploying their liquidity predominantly on the commercial side investing in new investments expanding their capital so that leaves about of the decline and about of that we were able to move to alternative higher yielding liabilities for them and that included we added about million this quarter off balance sheet in our repo products so that leaves about or million that left the company to pursue higher balances and so as we go forward having a good understanding of how we mitigate some of that activity but our production on the deposit side continues to increase we saw another quarter about increase in net production and that included increased production in dda and weve gotten more active back in cd promotions and so as we go forward our actions around deposits will be very consistent to jamies point well continue to focus on generating new deposits well continue to focus on mitigating some of the diminishment thats happening and our investments over the last several years as i mentioned earlier with treasury will help were also looking at some new industries and verticals that will help to supplement some of our asset generation with deposit generation including money service businesses which we rolled out last quarter so our focus internally is understanding some of the diminishment but continuing to focus on the new production that will allow us to generate growth going forward to jamies point kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co okay thanks kevin and thanks jamie appreciate all that one quick followup jamie i think you mentioned earlier about what the deposit costs were in september i was wondering if you happen to have them handy if you had maybe what the actual margin what the loan yields deposit costs were for september and then maybe any color you can provide on betas like what they were last cycle what youre assuming this cycle would be great thanks synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah ill focus in on the deposit side for the month of september when you look at interestbearing deposits for the month of september it was approximately basis points total deposits approximately basis points that was laid out in the deck when you look at the throughthecycle beta through september from the beginning to september you have a total deposit beta a interestbearing deposit beta and if you were to look at period to period quarter toquarter betas itd be interest im sorry interestbearing deposit beta and total deposit beta as weve said in the past our expectation was when we thought the debt might end at current levels at through the cycle total deposit beta will be around and as we said in the prepared remarks today if we assume that the fed goes to the mid then we would expect our throughthecycle total deposit beta to be somewhere between and and i want to give a little more color on that range so the would be what we would consider closer to our base case and that implies beyond a fed funds rate beyond that throughthecycle beta the that you have an incremental total deposit beta and that would get you to an approximate throughthe cycle beta with a terminal fed rate of and thats kind of that would be our current base case we do believe the throughthecycle beta could be higher which is why we gave the range given what we saw last quarter with nonbank liquidity alternatives and competition from nonbank alternatives to deposits and if that were to continue if that were to increase then you could see higher throughthecycle betas kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co okay appreciate all that color jamie thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah operator thank you our next question comes from jared shaw of wells fargo jared your line is now open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thanks good morning i guess kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 just one quick followup on that do you think that we could get to could we see the faster acceleration to that throughthecycle beta than weve seen so far or do you really think that its just sort of a continued sort of steady progression higher andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp if you go back and look at prior cycles then you should expect to see an acceleration so if you look at the to tightening cycle you definitely see an acceleration the further you get along in the tightening cycle the same thing happened in to and thats what we are expecting and so when you look at the quarteronquarter you have a total deposit beta of and then were forecasting that just to continue increasing and i just mentioned getting up to as high as potentially the incremental beta which leads to a throughthecycle in the mid and thats generally what we expect to see happen but yes you should see an acceleration in betas as we go through this jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then just as my followup could you give a little color on what the sentiment from your commercial customers is as were continuing into this period of maybe broader economic uncertainty are they still out there talking about growing and investing or are you seeing them start to become more cautious and maybe pull back a little bit more kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp jared ill start and ill ask bob if he wants to add anything from a credit standpoint i think in general its still cautiously optimistic i think you have to go back to what we talk about in terms of demographics in the southeast and the continued outperformance of our footprint in terms of population growth and business starts and so i think relatively speaking none of those elements have changed even though the economy is looking to slow a bit so as there is continuing to be economic growth in the footprint well continue to have folks that want to deploy capital i do think as i mentioned earlier in the call pipelines have diminished a bit and i think thats correlated to the sentiment of our business owners that they do see a slowing going forward i think part of that has been theres been a bit of a backlog with supply chain and whats been going on postcovid but in general theres still a positive sentiment were not seeing people that are overly concerned but were seeing a level of prudence and people are being conservative bob mentioned it earlier theyre still carrying a lot of cash on their balance sheets and so they still have a lot of dry powder if things were to go negative and quite frankly with rates rising theyre able to use some of that cash instead of using higher cost debt but im still cautiously optimistic and i think thats predicated on what were hearing from them bob would you add anything robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah jared the only thing i would add is we started last quarter with a commercial survey and did it again this quarter so two surveys in a row the difference i would highlight in those surveys is were beginning to see our synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 customers tell us that their input costs are beginning to wane a little bit and so early signs that perhaps inflation might be easing somewhat the other thing i would point to in those surveys that our customers still feel as kevin said relatively optimistic about their pipelines in their businesses going forward so not just anecdotal but results of that survey jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator thank you our final question for today comes from christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott christopher your line is now open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning kevin you gave us the update on maast earlier in the call and i was just curious as maast comes online next year to what extent can that be a positive contributor to kind of core deposit growth for the synovus engine in and kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp its a great point because i think weve talked a lot about maast and its ability to generate fee income through the payments products but it also can be a big deposit generator and it would be too early for me to prognosticate what those average balances are going to be but as weve gone through this pilot with our first isv weve onboarded over recurring billers these are the customers of the isv weve also opened up our website from a sales perspective and weve received unique customers coming to the website with the clickthrough rates that are three times the average of what you see in the industry so as weve talked about in the past there continues to be a great deal of excitement from these software providers to the product the other thing is weve been talking to more folks about being able to deliver it in what were seeing is that the average number of customers per isv is actually greater than what we had modeled so i give you all that as background because the only thing i can use to project what its going to do for us is whats happening with our pilot the early interest that were getting from isvs and as weve shared on previous calls it continues to be extremely positive so i believe that not only is it going to be a generator of fee income but its also going to generate deposits that will help our growth in some of the other areas of the bank christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks for getting into the detail there and i presume that relatively speaking the cost of those funds would be less it may not be zero but it would be less than some other funding that you have synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah youll have a dda account that sweeps the receivables from the payment but one of the things wed want to offer is that they could sweep that money into other interestbearing accounts so youd have a little bit of both youd have both a noninterestbearing component as well as interest bearing but it would be i think overall more attractive than any sort of normal funding or wholesale funding for example christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it great and jamie just a quick one as you think about the level of debt is there an upper bound to kind of where you dont want it to crossover a certain threshold i know its not an exact science but just kind of curious as you think through the next several quarters andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp as we look forward on the debt side i guess i would bifurcate the difference between collateralized borrowing at the home loan bank and facilities like that then corporate unsecured debt we have a lot of liquidity a significant amount of liquidity at hand when you think about the ability to use home loan bank capacity the ability to grow broker deposits from here the ability to grow core deposits and so we have a lot of different levers at hand and we believe that using liquidity sources like the thirdparty portfolio allowing that to indiscernible will benefit us and we believe that kind of those strategies can help hold off the need to issue any sort of corporate unsecured debt which is clearly the highest cost of them all christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks very much for all the information this morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer
