wehmer founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 thank you welcome everybody to our first quarter earnings call hope you are all isolated and well with me obviously dave dykstra tim crane our new wintrust president rich murphy vice chair and senior lending officer kate boege our general counsel and dave stoehr our chief financial officer kate boege is very worried because were all in different places and her shock collar doesnt come that far on me so kate i will behave i promise as you can see we do have additional wintrust execs on the call i think its important to get to know them better and i think there will be a lot of questions arising just because of the times and whats going on so i thought better to have more reinforcements around the format will be for the most part as usual however were going to try not to parrot whats already in the release to leave more time for the questions as i said as im sure youll have a number of them im going to give some general comments regarding our results dave dykstra will provide a more detailed analysis of other income other expenses and taxes back to me for a summary comments and thoughts about the future and well have time for questions before i get into the details i would like to do a heartfelt shout out to what i believe is the absolute best crew in the banking business case in point a couple of cases in point our crew has moved seamlessly to remote locations also being able to grow the bank and take care of our clients its worked extremely well our technology crew has done a wonderful job also in seven days we stood up a frontend portal ppp from scratch we opened the portal the only ones opened on the evening of april first day available and it actually worked flawlessly two weeks thereafter it was all working from remote locations and processed applications for billion that put us in the top of banks in the country in terms of total volume median size indiscernible fees to wintrust before round two approximate price of million our debts have cleared for round two we already have close to applications another million million in fees in there the applications again are in the lower area in the lower end area so we know weve taken care of all of our customers across the board i couldnt be prouder of the team thats been able to do this one point in time we had a need for more quality control people we had people volunteer people worked tirelessly all night one guy they called indiscernible other banks branches so quickly it was unbelievable and now on to our first quarter earnings as you can see weve made close to million down from the fourth quarter but for obvious reasons our earnings per share if you take our pretax preprovision pre msr valuation income its over million which is almost a record for us its pretty darn good in terms of core earnings and thats before really any recognition of the probably close to million well have in ppp income which will act as a reserve for us a cushion for us we believe for any eventuality may come along net interest margin held up pretty well as we were able to drop our deposit costs rapidly we still have room to go there as indicated on page of the press release the basis point margin decrease was due to really a basis point drop in the free funds ratio as youd expect as the overall rate environment goes down and basis point difference so basis point drop in earning asset yield basis point drop in liabilities net interest income was essentially flat really one less day was offset by million in average earning asset growth we expect the core nim that being net interest margin without ppp effect to drop to the levels previously disclosed in the past ph for future quarters however the amortization of ppp the terms of which are in question but no longer than two years and expected to be much shorter well have a material positive effect in both the margin and in the net interest income even in the worst case scenarios wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 on to the provision and credit quality adopted cecl its so early i think is i picked the wrong quarter indiscernible certainly picked the wrong corner to put cecl in effect now we adopted cecl day adjustment of million the first quarter provision of million which exceeded the fourth quarter provision by million our ending reserve was up million from year end to now the million ill leave this from here as im sure youre going to have a number of questions and on the cecl calculations ill leave that to our cecl experts who are here to answer your questions but net chargeoffs indiscernible million in q1 credit quality remained relatively in good shape the same period over period on apples to apples basis npls increased due to three factors first the pool accounting for acquired loans went away with the adoption of cecl adding about million to the total second approximately million of new nonaccruals were added to the normal course of business largest of these being an sba loan where we should get good recoveries indiscernible nonaccrual now these assets have been marked appropriately they will be resolved relatively quickly finally commercial premium finance loans over days delinquent indiscernible state imposed restrictions on canceling policies during the current crisis as you know our commercial premium finance portfolio is regulated individually by all states in the case of a crisis like we have now many of them preclude you from canceling policies however in the past we have only seen minor tick ups because they will go back and honor the actual cancellation date and most states are required to go back and honor that but so really the insurance companies take the hit on that but we do expect a minor tick up in chargeoffs but not as much as you would imagine thats always been the case in the past we had hurricanes fires et cetera indiscernible the material effects of the current crisis on our credit quality our ppp loans coupled with interest and principal deferrals have been granted to customers granted to our borrowers and other customers regulators are really cooperating on this and we believe that we should be able to weather the storm at least buy time for our borrowers coupled with their highly diversified portfolio and history of loan losses in troubled times vis Ã vis with peer group were cautiously optimistic but however at this point its a tossup as to if and when the stress will appear in the portfolio with our expected core earnings augmented by ppp earnings indiscernible reserves and capital we feel adequately situated to take on whatever comes our way look forward your questions in this area dave is going to cover other income other expense in detail but id like to suffice it to say that we had a great mortgage quarter indiscernible million mortgage servicing valuation expense that might be jinxed in this but i think they cant go down much more it had to be close to bottom of our mortgage servicing rights and our net overhead ratio was down basis points from fourth quarter of more than made up for the drop in the net interest margin on the balance sheet front we grew total assets grew billion average earning assets were up million our loans were up billion rich murphy will take you through the core of that but after that was probably related to line draws which happened very quickly weve seen abate at least get the initial fear of everybody has been drawing their lines its kind of abated a little with the work of the government and other opportunities the rest is across the board and were happy to break it out for a little bit later we started the quarter with million of loans where the period end exceeded the average so were going to start with a head start the second quarter that does include the ppp loans which as you know were now with round two indiscernible we funded about billion and we have well have about billion up to billion depending on how quick the window closes in round two wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 deposits grew billion in the quarter we feel very good about our liquidity position right now we will be able to take advantage of we had good liquidity to begin with they bulked up in anticipation of what was going on with our maxsafe loans where we offer times fdic coverage because of our charters and other wealth management opportunities including cdec which we expect to slow down a little bit but indiscernible money at the end of the quarter so we feel very good about where we are our loantodeposit ratio is and we will obviously go up with ppp loans but between our liquidity and our ability to take advantage of the feds lines related to ppp we feel very good about our liquidity where we stand right now so all in all we feel comfortable with our balance sheet our loan pipelines believe it or not remain very strong bit of halo effect coming on because of other banks dropping the ball on ppp we were able to pick up a number of prospects and customers and just the word of mouth and spreading that wintrust came through in our relationship indiscernible banking really works so our pipelines are good we have to remember the good loans are made in bad times so we feel very good about where we are right now on the balance sheet side we think were well prepared im going to turn over to dave who is going to provide some detail on other income other expenses and taxes dave david a dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp all right thanks ed as normal ill just briefly touch on the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections in the noninterest income section our wealth management revenue increased to a record million in the first quarter compared to million in the fourth quarter of last year and its up from the million recorded in the year ago quarter overall we believe that first quarter was another solid quarter for our wealth management unit asset valuation is declining towards the end of the quarter may create some headwinds in the second quarter but the trading volume is also fairly solid right now so well see how that comes out in the second quarter but the first quarter was a solid quarter for us mortgage banking revenue increased by or to million in the first quarter from the million recorded in the prior quarter and was up a strong from the million recorded in the first quarter of last year the company originated approximately billion of mortgage loans for sale on the first quarter of this compares to a similar billion of originations in the prior quarter and million in the first quarter of last year the increase in the revenue from the prior quarter results primarily from million of derivative income associated with the mandatory commitments to fund mortgage originations compared to a million derivative loss on similar activity in the prior quarter that was offset by a negative msr adjustment net of the hedging contract during the first quarter of approximately million and that compares to a million positive msr adjustment in the fourth quarter of and we also had million less of capitalized mortgage servicing revenue compared to the prior quarter if we had one less sale of our loans during the quarter so there might be a little bit of a timing difference there the derivative income i talked about really is associated with the surge of the refinancing activity where we had mandatory commitments to fund approximately billion of mortgage loans at march or march of and thats roughly billion more in mandatory commitments to fund than weve averaged over the past four wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 quarters so it hasnt really been a big adjustment in the prior quarters because of the amount of loans that we had mandatory commitments to fund were always fairly stable around a few hundred million dollars and it just jumped up by about a billion so the positive momentum in the mortgage business and obviously that pipeline bodes well for closings in the future quarters the mix of loan volume originated for sale was that was related to the refinance activity was approximately in the first quarter compared to in the prior quarter so the refinance volume increased slightly during the quarter and the pipeline is still predominantly filled with refinance applications we currently expect second quarter originations to be stronger than the first quarter and thats a result of the continuation of the refinance activity and the strong pipeline table of our earnings release provides a detailed compilation on the components of the origination volumes and the production revenue and msr capitalizations paydowns and valuation activity the company recorded losses on investment securities of approximately million during the first quarter primarily related to unrealized losses associated with equity funds that the holding company has investments in which were initially used as seed money for proprietary mutual funds as you all know equities had big drops at the end of the first quarter so those valuations declined other noninterest income totaled million in the first quarter up approximately million from the million recorded in the prior quarter primary reasons for the higher revenue in this category include million of higher swap fee revenue and million of net gains related to sales of certain loans and leases and this was offset by a million of lower boli income as boli investments thats supported deferred compensation plans were negatively impacted by equity market returns but i should note that the decrease in the boli income in the first quarter resulted in a similar decrease in compensation expense during the quarter so the net effect of that is washed out in total turning to the noninterest expense categories noninterest expense totaled million in the first quarter down approximately million or from the prior quarter a number of factors contributed to the decrease salaries and employee benefits expense were down million from the prior quarter lower levels of advertising and marketing expenses of million compared to the prior quarter we had million less of oreo expenses and we had million of charges in the fourth quarter of last year that didnt recur related to the legal settlement charges contingent purchase price payments and costs and terminating too small pension plans and then those aforementioned changes i just discussed were offset by million of higher fdic insurance assessments due to the rebates from fdic substantially subsiding in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter ill talk in more detail about the major categories now the salaries and employee benefit expense categories i said declined by million from the prior quarter the majority of the decline in this expense category related to reduced incentive compensation accruals which were approximately million lower than the prior quarter with that change being driven largely by longterm incentive compensation programs which are forecast to be negatively affected by the impacts of the current economic conditions brought on by the pandemic situation additionally salaries expense were down by million from the fourth quarter the primary cause of the decline was million reduction in deferred compensation costs that were related to the boli investments that i previously discussed and then offsetting those decreases were employee benefit expenses were up approximately million during the quarter due to higher amounts of payroll taxes which tend to be elevated in the first quarter of the year wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 data processing expense increased by in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of this was due primarily to approximately million of the conversion charges related to the countryside acquisition versus only of conversion charges related to the stc capital bank system conversion that happened in the prior quarter the additional operating costs of data processing related to the franchise also contributed to the increase for your information we also expect to incur slightly more than million of additional conversion related charges in the second quarter related to the just completed conversion of the countryside bank transaction and by the way our teams did a terrific job of completing that this past weekend given they were working in a remote work environment and social distancing requirements et cetera so our first virtual conversion went off well fdic insurance expense as i mentioned was up million in the first quarter as a result of the assessment credits substantially going away we had roughly of assessment credits yet in the first quarter of but we are essentially done with those i think we have a little less than that could still be credited professional fees decreased to million in the first quarter compared to million in the prior quarter professional fees as you know can fluctuate on a quarterly basis based on the level of legal services for acquisitions litigation problem loan workouts as well as any consulting services this category of expenses came down from the prior quarter due to a decline in legal fees associated with litigation collections and acquisitions the category also experienced a slightly lower level consulting engagement class and if you look at the professional fees over the past five quarters its averaged million so the we incurred this quarter is relatively in line with our typical amount advertising and marketing expenses in the first quarter decreased by million when compared to the prior quarter the decline was primarily related to lower mass media advertising costs which tend to be lower in the first quarter of the year and we also had some medium media spending that was associated with various sporting events that did not occur due to the cancellation of events cancellation of those events later in the quarter oreo expense were actually negative by approximately in the first quarter as the company recorded a gain of million on the sale of a piece of oreo property and that gain was an amount that exceeded the aggregate costs of oreo expenses and negative valuation charges on other pieces of oreo and the miscellaneous expense category totaled million in the first quarter compared to million in the fourth quarter of a decrease of approximately million the decrease was impacted by approximately million of charges in the prior quarter for legal settlement charges additional expense accrued with contingent purchase price payments that did not occur in the current quarter and the current quarter also had a lower level of travel and entertainment expenses as you can imagine and a variety of other smaller fluctuations so other than those categories i just discussed all other categories of noninterest expense were down on an aggregate basis by from the fourth quarter of and so they were essentially flat the net overhead ratio as ed mentioned stood at which is down basis points from the recorded in the prior quarter and the ratio benefited from current balance sheet growth from mortgage banking results and lower non interest expenses and we would expect that net overhead ratio to stay well below the in the nearterm due to continuing strong mortgage market the strong balance sheet growth including the lending related to the ppp and focus on expense control so with that i will turn it back over to ed wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 edward joseph wehmer founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you dave you remind me the guy at the end of our mortgage commercial talks really fast anyhow back to me for some summary thoughts and thinking about the future these are really crazy times i kind of feel like bill murray in groundhog day in fact my alarm clock which is alexa will play indiscernible plays sonny and chers i got you babe every morning when i get up on purpose quarter and all was really it was really a pretty good quarter given the current environment as i said the indiscernible quarter is to adapt cecl i think that weve adapted well to the current environment as well as it can be i think our crew is working extremely well our ability to service our clients needs as it relate to ppp loans credit modifications new credit will hopefully have credit issues going forward at least the financial effects of those will were not naive enough to think that there will not be a some kind of revocations the situation indiscernible however would say this should affect us less than our peers due to our portfolio diversification and concerned underwriting culture so these losses will be a function of how fast we can get back to work earnings from ppp loans will write a wonderful cushion against these unknowns time will tell but we feel pretty darn good about where were at we said before the crisis that we need to grow through this low rate environment which is exactly what were doing some of which we didnt anticipate but our core growth we anticipate to be is very good we think our expenses will be in check just thinking about travel and entertainment and no baseball season and save a lot of money there but i again i cant say enough about the wintrust crew and our ability to ride this out and do indiscernible shareholders our customers our employees and the communities that we serve and you can be assured of our best efforts in getting through this crisis and continue to build wintrust in the solid way you know weve always done it then id like to turn over to questions wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is now open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi thanks good morning everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i hope you have your mask on ed maybe doing that edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp n95s baby jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes i wanted to talk about credit but i guess first dave he has talked about the revenue line pretax pre provision and on mortgage i just wonder im trying to understand what youre saying you have the million commitment i guess gain because of the big pipeline and i think youre saying that may or may not recur in q2 but likely you may not have the msr headwind as well in q2 so positive although sustained this kind of revenue momentum in mortgage is that fair david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well i think the pipeline is still pretty strong so i think were still it looks like we still are building the pipeline purchase activity is going to fall off a little bit but were going to probably close more loans in the second quarter so well have production gain there but that will be offset by probably that derivative going down a little bit so i think were sort of looking at exmsrs that sort of being a relatively stable revenue quarter first quarter to second quarter edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp derivative will watch itself out and then well have the regular gains from this quarter especially with the hangovers jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 okay edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp from the quarter from book to from lock to closed david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah but we expect we usually dont have that much visibility going out but the lock terms have lengthened out because theres so much volume so we think well still have a fairly decent pipeline on those loans that they have mandatory commitments thats the only quarter well have to see but so i expect that will be down a little bit but then the actual gain on sale of higher level of production that we sold will be up a little bit so probably offsetting to a greater degree edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay and then bigger picture credit one of your comments i dont know if this is for you rich but if and when stress shows up in the portfolio with the comment that you made and i could you give us the ed wehmer view of kind of the nearterm mediumterm portfolio stress that you expect to see edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well ill give you the foot level and murph can kind of jump in im sure on some of the areas that you want to cover its kind of like time is stopping for two months or three months i mean were giving two or three were given threemonth deferrals of principal interest to a lot of clients regulators are okay with that taking it on to the end its not they dont become indiscernible really until after two of those really six months that ppp loans that weve did almost billion of those out there to our clients and our clients alike but still majority to our clients indiscernible them two months of little over two months of breathing room the stimulus comes in indiscernible a couple months so if you figure it i dont think youre going to see the stress until if we can get out of this in two months the stress will be mitigated if we dont get out of it in two months youre going to have delayed stress that will come into the portfolio or more fortunate we dont have a lot of credit cards or consumer debt on the books where things could get a little dicey but if you think about indiscernible if we have a we have a mortgage if we give a threemonth deferral that guy is okay and especially they got a ppp thats gets paid its put on the end no problem if you think about a commercial multifamily guy i need rental payment okay i need principal payment so the whole world is stopping for two or three months and i think that any stress that comes through would be a hangover at the end in the event that we cant get out its going to take six months to get out of where were at then i think you have issues unless a government comes in and provides more money into the system so i think theyll do and say really indiscernible lot of respects by the shutdown i think that theyre committed to keeping this going then you got to wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 worry about rates increase but worry about higher rates down the road and where qe is going to take to all economy murph you want to get into some of the specifics on the area parts of the indiscernible consider the more vulnerable parts of the portfolio by the community richard b murphy a executive vice president chief credit officer wintrust financial corp yeah i would echo eds comments to begin with i think that if we can bounce out of this pretty quickly we have programs in place here that have helped our customers and i think theyll respond accordingly but obviously the longer it takes to get out of this and for customer behavior and the consumer behavior to realty go back to normal i think thats the big question that everybody is asking one of the examples i use is for we have a longtime movie theater operator in chicago that we have a reasonably sized not a big loan too but for him you just have to question how long will it be before people want to go back into a movie theater and thats a good example of where the uncertainty is pretty big but as it relates to our high impact industries we brought and we gave you a lot of detail there and obviously the one that jumps out at you is the franchise portfolio generally speaking we think the franchise portfolio is in pretty good shape for a couple of reasons one is that we have mostly quick service restaurants that are of that portfolio most of those are still open most of those are too really strong operators with good franchisors so we feel pretty good we also have seen a lot of those customers take advantage of some of the deferments and ppp opportunities so generally speaking those are holding in pretty well but clearly that is a large segment in the portfolio at just about billion and its obviously a very impacted industry as well as it relates to hospitality and oil and gas and some of the other areas that are areas for concern those are relatively small for us we have not typically played in those places all that much the oil and gas is really a function of some of the leasing work weve done over the last couple of years but i would just really go back to eds comments that right now the diversity in the portfolio gives us a lot of comfort we generally pick very strong operators that we want to finance but the ripple effects and the length of those ripples we just dont know right now so time will tell jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then just one small one the premium finance nonperformance just kind of keep creeping up is that the administrator or is there anything new there indiscernible edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah thats what what i was saying earlier what you have when have these crises and again youre governed by each state the regulation so in florida whenever there is a hurricane you cannot cancel policy so what youve got is policies that are people havent made their payments or nor going to be canceled youre not wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 allowed to cancel most of them allow you to go back and cancel them as of that date the date that it would have been canceled retroactively you cant take there you cant lose youve got businesses insurance so youre going to see those creep up as i said earlier you can see a minor tick up in the losses really from maybe basis points to basis points or something you can go back and look whenever weve had those types of issues that this is not every states done it i think maybe states have done it but insofar in terms of not allowing cancellations during this period of time but they always indiscernible get your principal back maybe add all your interest or late fees but you get a lot of that back anyhow so youre going to see those keep popping up a little bit until the crisis is over but again its not usually a long situation for us jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thanks i appreciate it edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp you bet operator thank you our next question comes from david long with raymond james your line is now open edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp how are you doing david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc as a fellow fan at airplanes i do have to commend you on your choice of remarks that lloyd bridges indiscernible for calling it out edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i kind of like wolf was better though indiscernible full picture the wolf is awesome indiscernible david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 yes indeed so anyways i wanted to followup on that on the premium finance business i know we just talked a little bit about the seeing a bit of an uptick there but the reserve levels in general are always very low for that business indiscernible basis points maybe basis points of reserves on the commercial side maybe just remind us why you can carry such a low reserve in that business and maybe give us an example of a situation absent covid19 that you may or could lose money in that business edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well our life insurance business indiscernible so and on the commercial business ill let dave and murph take you through that david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah so dave on the commercial business generally were financing commercial insurance policies for workers comp building coverage liability coverage or whatever it is and theyre generally annual policies so we finance those policies by generally taking down so down is sort of a standard down payment indiscernible over generally months to months i think our average is just slightly over months so if your collateral is the unearned premium held by the insurance carriers which are generally high rated insurance carriers that we do business with so if that premium which is your collateral amortizes one 365th or one in a leap year per day it amortizes away and earns out that collateral is deteriorating on a daily basis but since you took down on that policy thats your initial cushion and since we pay that have that loan payoff monthly over to months our loan pays off faster than the collateral deteriorates so thats generally why you dont have losses in that industry sometimes you could have losses if you take a lesser down payment and you dont have as much collateral cushion and then if they dont make their payment the states will require you to generally give them a notice of time that to tell them that theyve been delayed or defaulted on their loan and then you can cancel the policy so that may be or days depending on the state and so then your collateral continues to deteriorate during that notice period so if you cut your collateral position too short then because you took less down payment it may eat into your collateral enough when they default on their payment that youd have some small losses and then there are losses sometimes from auditable policies workers comp indiscernible some of those policies are auditable and to the extent that the estimated premium in the frontend was off a little bit from what the actual premium was so when they audit the payrolls or the fleet size then you could have some losses those are the general reasons for it so and edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible fraud or insurance company went bankrupt in case of a bankruptcy we monitor the indiscernible reports and we have credit limits for each insurance company with nine months well pay out it usually takes more than nine months for an insurance company to go down so we can stop doing business with them and then mitigate it you cant have agent fraud but weve developed the number systems in the past weve had some large ones relatively large for a time maybe million million million we have not had one in a long time but were wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 doing a much better job electronically of screening for those but knock on wood we havent had one of those so thats where you could lose money now what i was saying is there were some cancellations they dont allow cancellations you feel your collateral is going to run off but the cancellations theyre allowing you to backdate once we get to it they always allow you to back date it when it would have been the insurance company is the one really kind of loses on that situation but its not so much because claims usually arent that high so especially in something like this and in terms of a hurricane and the like maybe a little bit different way of higher claims but thats how it usually happens and weve averaged around anywhere between basis points basis points normally on that and thats always over that number and again life knock on wood billion when we lost the dime so i think were okay david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc excellent i really appreciate the color there thats helpful and then as it relates to the franchise finance side of things you indicated that about are quick service are there any other of the remaining exposures that you consider much riskier anything that you can point there that are at the remaining part of that portfolio richard b murphy a executive vice president chief credit officer wintrust financial corp yeah i mean the dinein restaurants is really where i think youre going to be most impacted for us thats about million all wellknown names but its just obviously theyre the most profounding impacted by this edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp many of them have taken the ppp loans from us or from other banks because many of these are syndicated deals and theyve also gone for deferrals so again this is a situation where a couple months look fine and hopefully they get out of this and people theyre going out eat again theyll be fine and when it gets pushed off and very logical way to look at it however it keeps you dont get back to business until septemberoctober you can have some issues david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it and then just the last one you kind of hinted on this but if no one attempts wrigley field this summer or the indiscernible those are marketing expenses that im assuming you guys would not be spending edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp that is correct indiscernible you name it we would not be spending that money but id rather spend i go to ballgames myself but we actually indiscernible edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp and some minor league teams around chicago would that be we would not be paying that can be a significant amount of money wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks guys appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens your line is now open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc good morning edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning indiscernible just wanted to ask the net interest margin questions im going to ask one just taking a step back as you think about the second quarter you have the full impact of the march rate cuts but then youve got multiple more quarters of just lowering deposit rate so under that big picture view dave does that net interest margin bottom out here in the second quarter and then likely potentially move higher in the second half of the year as deposit prices come down david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well if youre talking about the core net interest margins yes it would go down but remember were going to have almost million of ppp fees when we bring it in over two years at the longest with the shortest itll be people indiscernible go for relief of the funds these are all every one of these can be it is for two months it can be twoandhalf months they can apply to the sba and have them forgiven they are forgiven we take the money upfront so in a worst case scenario for two years if we if the whole thing ran out for two years the margin would be okay right around where it is if it comes in a people at the end of this quarter and beginning of the third quarter get those get their funds for their loans forgiven we have million coming in during that period of time so thats going to positively affect the margin so the margin the core margin is going to end up like i said where in the and range somewhere around that based on where we are right now but the ppp ones are going to protect us for two years or one year and some derivative between two months and two years you tell me but they will help the margin and obviously help net interest income to grow nicely so between that and our growth i would expect and start bouncing back from there on the core side but the ppp loans are going to be very helpful from the income side to help cushion any longterm credit issues we have but also from a margin standpoint if all im saying there i kind of drifted a little bit terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc yeah understand your thought process on ppp and how that plays into a margin just thinking about the revenue related to ppp and what that can be to building capital i know you have the million in this that you wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 mentioned in the release and i just want to make sure that million is just kind of whats in the pipeline my guess is you assume that grows and increases on ppp around and then what are the expenses that we should think about related to ppp just so we can calculate the bottom line impact that obviously will help your capital ratios edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i think the marginal expenses are absolutely zero we setup the system on our own and these are people we had some people from all over at home but will jump in and out them we didnt add much or any outside vendor i dont think there was any issues related to that do you think of any dave or dave stoehr david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp no i think its generally just a people issue with our staff that we already have onboard that to clear up the back end you obviously have some minor data process incurred just because you have more accounts part on the fis system but it shouldnt be that much of additional expenses edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp if any really itd be negligible terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then just on the round two of ppp you said ph million thats going to be higher as has been before david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah well indiscernible edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible million million they will be waiting for indiscernible tonight once you get your indiscernible theyre committed later thats about million of fees terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thats rough numbers indiscernible you go through the process which we will have done today on the current we should have done today and the stuff that came in we open the portal last night there were some duplicates and the like so roughly around million more and million more so take plus or minus wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 maybe well know better at the end of the day but and then we may open the portal again once we get through that we kind of think that this next round is because many of the banks were not would drop the ball on this there were a number of customers that are waiting indiscernible billion come in they only funded billion or billion which means they have billion theyre going hit the indiscernible we had of ours all the way through the process in round one indiscernible be fully funded today the other guys didnt so theyre going to this is going to last maybe hours at the most so indiscernible next allotment we will be very careful we dont overextended it and indiscernible but we think we can get these through and plusminus whether we get any more on top of it will be a function where we sit at the end of the day in terms of our production or where we are in our manufacturing process if you will terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thats great color thank you operator thank you our next question comes from michael young with suntrust robinson humphrey your line is now open michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey thanks good morning edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp hey mike michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey wanted to start this with the cecl reserve its a little lower than peers and i understand there are some mixed benefits from the premium finance book but can you just maybe talk about kind of the economic assumptions that are currently underlying the adjustment you made this quarter and any kind of outlook going forward from here and to on the need to continue to build this reserve david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well we put in the slide deck what our macroeconomic scenario factors are the ones that are the key drivers for our models so its some of the credit spreads commercial real estate price and fees the gdp growth et cetera so those are the ones that impact our portfolios the most that have the best correlation and then work best as you look back through the cycles wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 so those are the factors that most impacted but i got to tell you i was reading some of the sellside analyst reports last night and i thought i was reading like goldilocks and the three bears some people thought i had too much some people thought we had too little and some people that we were just right so im not sure that i as i look out there you may have a different view but it seems like to me were more towards the top of the bell curve and there are some outliers on either side but as you said our mix with premium finance loans i think helps that out quite a bit and i think our diversity helps that out quite a bit so we think were comfortable with where the cecl reserves are at its substantially more than what our run rate was you look at the total reserve build and right now were comfortable with where its at weve gone through all the business lines weve done all that heavy lifting theres more stimulus thats come in that hopefully should help et cetera so i dont know if you can look into your crystal ball any better than or anybody on this call or us and know how long this pandemic is going to last and what the lasting effects are so im not even going to take a shot at q2 reserves they could be higher they could be lower but well have to see how quickly the economy reopens and how quickly things start getting back to normal but our view is probably is not a vshape its not a complete u shape its probably someplace in between there ive heard like every letter of the alphabet id probably like a dshape some goofy shape out there but nobodys talked about but were monitoring the portfolio well were managing it well and we had a credit team that put up there with anybody and well see where it goes but im not sure were going to try to make a prediction on i mean it could be better it could be worse as ed said its just what a time for cecl to come in it is not transparent i think looking company to company but if you look at some of the metrics that ive been looking at it seems like were sort of in the middle of the pack and we certainly didnt try to do that it just seems to be where were landing and i understand people can take a more dark view of where this is going and some people can take a more favorable view but we took what we thought was the best reasonable view that we could use in our modeling and our subject matter experts on the credit side and we think were okay for now michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks for all that info and maybe just following up i appreciate the breakout on covid impacted industries specifically but also just wanted to get some high level thoughts on commercial real estate and construction particularly retail and just kind of any mitigating factors that you guys are looking at or any portfolio analysis that youve done thus far david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp i think rich richard b murphy a executive vice president chief credit officer wintrust financial corp yeah i mean cre is a bit of a wild card i mean weve spent some time kind of thinking through what it might mean were pretty welldiversified in the cre book multifamily being the largest segment in multifamily generally speaking its chicago metro its performed very well very good long time operators so i think that that im feeling pretty comfortable about that industrial is a decent size portfolio for us i feel pretty good about that i mean obviously the overall business impact will determine ultimately how that performs wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 the areas that get give me the most concern is retail and office i think office because i think that this work fromhome model that weve all adapted is something that we really wont know what its going to look like a year from now two years from now five years from now but its going to be different and how that impacts our portfolio it remains to be seen that being said again we tend to be very granular in those deals and we tend to really pick very strong operators so again im feeling okay there retail is the segment that probably concerns me the most in general as weve said in the past our approach towards retail has been to really try to reduce that portfolio over the last five years which weve been pretty successful at but where we do have exposure its none of the big box i shouldnt say none but i mean very little of the big box regional type retail exposure where our a great majority of our retail exposure exists is in the towns and communities that we have banks and so these are the downtown suburban type operators and i think that there are still going to be viable operations going forward but i dont know when but generally speaking i feel that thats going to rebound better than most but it is one of those with that i people are shopping on amazon and the numbers are obvious but dramatically higher levels and i dont think that youre going to see reversion back to what weve seen in the past i think those peoples shopping habits are going to change in a pretty meaningful way going forward edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah murph and i talk about that a lot i say youre going to keep my wife out of shopping youre crazy and youre going to keep me here at the office im going to the office shell kick me out so theres a lot of indiscernible we have to wait and see but i think as murph says were diversified enough know our borrowers enough i think we will know everybodys bought two three months with ppp loans with deferrals and the like even in offices and what have you well know in two to three months how this is going to shake out where its going to go and how its going to work so i think that were kind of in a limbo weve got to get out of this and then well see if all this happens but well be very cognizant of it already in any underwriting were doing or and some of the new stuff is going to be very cognizant but well be very careful for sure because good loans are made in bad times but you got to you have to have a better crystal ball of where the type of assets that you will take as collateral michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thanks operator thank you our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 hey ed how are you doing question kind of a high level question in the past youve talked about the ropea dope and not the need to go there what would it take for you to pivot is it these two to three months and we dont get the outcome were looking for im just interested in your thoughts and what may pivot the bank strategy more significantly thanks edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well the ropeadope before was really brought out by two things one is we couldnt get paid for the risk we were taking and so it didnt mean our profitability models pretty much any to deal out there and secondly we were seeing way too many critical exceptions to loan policy and we just said were not going to do that we have not the spreads are actually moving up on the lending side which is a good thing so were meeting our profitability models there and we are very closely monitoring exceptions thats something could slow us down a little bit if its in terms of making new loans and the like is if guys are given too many exceptions but i think were seeing people pull back enough that this may have sounds goofy this may but a but a timely crisis because we have started seeing people scrounging for yield as rates went down to zero again and taking more risk but now this has brought everybody back and theyre thinking i think were rationally about pricing and collateral what have you well see if we got this or they revert back to the goofy stuff but who knows murph richard b murphy a executive vice president chief credit officer wintrust financial corp yeah ive been absolutely agree with that i think while it wasnt ropeadope in back half of and the first part of we were having trouble really growing ci opportunities because there were just a lot of people in that same space fighting at structures and pricing that just made no sense for us and the ph cnbf market was very active in the cre space i would agree with what ed said i mean the market had gotten goofy and way too aggressive and this crisis certainly has snapped back those trends pretty dramatically edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp it was pretty interesting for us as the kind of the halo effect that we got from our ppp work where our competitors were unable to service their clients and they call us and maybe we knew the owner or whatever had a personal account or what have you we had some relationship with them we were able to get them on and service them a large bank in town hardly did any of the oldest largest bank that were our competitor didnt do any hardly and thats opened up an opportunity for us to pick up really solid opportunities going forward and at reasonable pricing so it could be a little bit of a godsend so ropeadope right now who knows we see opportunities for growth right now at our pricing our parameters for good solid longterm companies that are in the higher impact risk areas that lot of people do a lot of hotel loans right about now do a lot more restaurant loans but a lot of really solid other businesses that were going to have shots that weve never had before so kind of mixed right now but were obviously very vigilant in terms of whats going on because as dave pointed out earlier about cecl who the hell knows where were going to end up christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks for that thats good color just one more question on the ppp obviously the we all may try and make our assumptions on where the economy is going but it seems like the banks are going to generate a tremendous i think you said almost million of fees i guess the question becomes i know youre bound by the models wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 but when it seem conceptually the right thing to do just to put this back into the reserve and make people feel a bit better about adequacy for the industry edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well we got to go with the black box and see where it goes but i would just say that we who knows when that money that money can come in over two years over one year over six months i dont know when its coming in i look at them independently the reserve will be what it is and the ppp fees will be what they are and never the twain shall meet i think we have the we really dont have a lot of art left in the box and well see where it goes but i would imagine if the things turn bad you can indiscernible qualitative things it would go over the top and match it up nicely who knows you got to look indiscernible my point and christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i get it i got it david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp gap is gap chris so you know christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i was looking for the qualitative comment that i ed referred to thats helpful dave indiscernible the tax rate going forward how should we think about it to q1 david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah yeah i still think you think about it sort of the to the first quarter because the stock price was down so much that benefit we usually get in the first quarter from stock based compensation was actually negative a little bit and the boli adjustment was actually negative a little bit so i think i still look at sort of a normalized tax rate to be to christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc indiscernible david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah yeah edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp chris i have a question for you can i ask you one wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc absolutely edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp why is that our stock get so beat up all the time i dont understand why we trade so much lower than everybody else indiscernible christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah i think i think the i think the market is a lot of the volatility in these stocks lately has been i think somewhat less fundamental and somewhat technical but i agree thats why if i were constructive edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs your line is now open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thank you can you hear me edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah brock were good how are you brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc doing well i wondered if i had managed to pop in the queue so its great i was wondering given your comments about the outlook and a number of banks ive talked about how their outlook squared with moodys as moodys is working on with so much of the industry and whether they use the base case of the adverse outlook could you touch on that and what you consulted outside for kind of a reality check on the outlook david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yes i mean so we look at a lot of different things i mean you look at the base case you look at the severity you look at the long end of the pandemic when we run the models on all of it we talk to our business people so we look at blue chip the blue chip economists models and we look at the consensus moodys models and so but we have to pick at the end of the quarter you have to pick a scenario and run with it but then youre informed by those other models that you run and the consensus blue chips and the consensus and the blue chip models that we compare and contrast against and then we get the qualitative input from our business leaders so you dont you have to pick one to base your model off but then there are qualitative factors that you had to layer on because at some point you had to pick a scenario and run with it because you cant moodys was change in wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 scenarios weekly almost for this for this thing so then you took some you ran some other models to find out where the guardrails were on the ups and the downsides and then you square that with the business leaders that have their fingers into the pulse of those scenarios and you indiscernible the process so id say we were informed by a number of different moodys models and other models out there brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and in terms of forbearance i saw the reference in the press release i believe in terms of that it tailing off here in april have you released the percentage on commercial and cre deferrals that you did grant indiscernible edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp go ahead dave david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no i dont know if we have those i think we noted in the press in the release that we had about million of outstanding balances for commercial and commercial real estate loans that we had some sort of modifications too and thats what we have thats what we have right now so edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp those are ones that are actually booked theres ones that are going through the profit that were still evaluating and we have not booked yet that will show up over the course of the next couple of months but i dont have the detail on that brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp and on our retail residential real estate mortgages we solved most of that so we do do a servicing portfolio and then we have some in our portfolio we are tracking so far were tracking better than the mba averages that theyre putting out there on that so indiscernible david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no the numbers are sort of our numbers are a little more current than the mba any numbers so i havent seen the most recent mba ones but we are better than the mba average on that wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for the color operator thank you our next question comes from nathan race with piper sandler your line is now open nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co thanks hi guys good morning wanted to ask some questions on just updated thoughts on capital planning and priorities obviously with total riskbased capital coming down basis points or so sequentially and i obviously understand indiscernible cant project what credit costs are going to look like but just curious to kind of get some updated thoughts on capital deployment priorities and how you guys kind of see capital levels projecting to the extent you can kind of predict just given all the uncertainty that exists today david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well i mean we look at we look at our capital levels all the time and we go through stress analysis on them the ppp loans are going to be capital free from a riskbased perspective so thats not going to impact us its going to be shortterm in nature anyway were still generating positive earnings this quarter and expect to do so going forward weve suspended the share repurchase but that was prudent to do i still believe the dividend is appropriate but well let the board of directors decide that as they move forward but we continue to think capitals adequate we would look i mean if we continue to grow or there we have these opportunities that talks about and we have growth opportunities out there and the equity markets opened up we could look at some preferred or some subdebt but its not critical that we do that right now but were always watching those markets because we do expect to continue to grow so edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah we wont be spending indiscernible cash on acquisition where stock price indiscernible make much sense so i think that dave laid out nicely our growth is indiscernible zero based risk ratings and we keep a close eye on the whole thing and we do we run more stress test i think than most people do and we feel very comfortable where we are right now but it depends on our growth prospects other than the non with the zerobased risk rating stuff so we feel very good about where we are and well thats where we are nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co understood thats helpful and speaking of the stress test i think when you guys last submitted dfast in you guys indicated that you could have cumulative losses in a severe adverse scenario so i guess im just curious as you guys have kind of stress tested the book more recently i mean any kind of thoughts or guidance in terms of kind of what you guys could see in that kind of adverse scenario under the current circumstances that exist today wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no we havent we havent disclosed that nathan so i mean people can look at that stress test but that was a im not sure you can compare that any environment to this i mean it may be a good environment as your best one to look at but we havent disclosed the stress test in a couple of years either to give you something on this call like that wed have to wed have to give that more thought because we havent done a dfast stress test per se that weve made public so far so we do them internally but i dont have the numbers other than to tell you right now that we believe with a tremendous amount of stresses we see that were fine edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yes indiscernible general statement know that we do stress the portfolio and we feel that right were in pretty good shape nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co understood and if i could just ask one more on ppp i appreciate all disclosures in the deck notes that you guys have funded relief through the ppp for call it of those select high impact industries so im just curious based on the pipeline of ppp loans you have where do you expect that number moving forward in terms of providing that added cushion for those selectively high impact industries edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible the first round for our clients most of them are down at round one to go forward were actually weve actually been reaching out into the neighborhoods to indiscernible neighborhoods to people who say they cant get the loans and really reaching out to our customers saying hey come on well get you in because we really have this system nailed and we feel were in pretty good shape so we basically had the portal open from now hours maybe in total in total weve taken into over applications so we tried that we closed it indiscernible rather do some direct work to make sure that we covered people who may not have been as fortunate to be there but or to have their data and understand what it is we really reached out to do that because but really when you think of it most of our most of the guys who are in our troubled in severely impacted industries were the first guys in theyre not dumb theyre very smart people i will say that you might ask what motivates our people to do this i think weve had a number of great notes from people that if you think about it were going to keep businesses from probably bankruptcy in a lot of cases indiscernible maybe average employees thats people they all have four an average with their four dependents thats million people that were affecting and let sleep easier every night because for two months theyre going to their salaries their benefits and thats what keep kept our people working until midnight in the morning is doing the good were doing and how often do you have a chance to touch that many people in your life much less in two weeks so we feel very good about what were doing here and we think were doing our contribution and as it relates to the impacted industries they run right out of the box now weve to make sure those who really dont get it or get that so thats what our focus has been in the last rounds wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 richard b murphy a executive vice president chief credit officer wintrust financial corp i would add that from the release date through which does not include this phase we are up about another to highly affected industries nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co understood thats great to hear i appreciate all the color thanks guys operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from david chiaverini with wedbush your line is now open david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi david david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc i wanted to ask you about how is it going so i wanted to ask you about expenses so in the past youve mentioned about keeping the net overhead ratio below i think i heard you mention that it should be well below so i was wondering is that the new bogey now less than did i hear you right david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah you heard me edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible get it but has always been the indiscernible bank and i think that with our growth and whats going on with our asset growth and our expense control base just whats going on here indiscernible ability to open branches and do things like we normally do right now the rest of the business plus the mortgage margins and how well were doing there i think that yeah you should be well below i think we could even make it below if things go right but the bogey will be or better were not changing it yet but i think we expected for the next few quarters to be below and to be in the range and go for the lower than if were good david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i think what said in my comments with the growth of the balance sheet related to ppp and the strong mortgage markets and the lack of some of the expenses that are going to flow through just due to the situation were in travel entertainment some of the sponsorships of some of the summer events et cetera we should be wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 below for the time being but i agree with ed thats general target in the normal environment is still sort of below the but yes i did say below because i think in the near term quarters thats still going to be the case david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks for that and hows your de novo outlook changed at all previously you were planning about a dozen branches over the next to months has that backdrop kind of shifted your thinking on that edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp not really slowed it down a little again weve taken basically a couple months off of were all in this hibernating if you will but these are areas were committed to we have space were rolling and were aware there are opportunities for us to continue to build and grow and weve always invested in our business we are a growth company the acquisitions arent going as planned or theyre not the market indiscernible price to acquisitions we will turn to de novo growth these are basically all indiscernible but the timing will be probably more spread out than before david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and then the last one for me on loan growth and you touched on a little bit earlier but to be clear youre still expecting mid to highsingle digit growth and in the context of line utilization rates and the drawdowns did kind of surge at the end of the first quarter could that be a headwind to loan growth if things start to normalize and these companies start to pay down those drawdowns edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp rich richard b murphy a executive vice president chief credit officer wintrust financial corp yeah i think overall economic activity is certainly going to be muted in the remainder of the year so thats going to have an effect i do think a couple of things that are going to be interesting to watch will be i do think that this halo effect is real that i think that we will have some real opportunities with customers that in the past we just havent had a lot of success with that we would really like to bank so i think thatll be a good opportunity i think the ph first insurance groups also will continue to do reasonably well edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp ticket size indiscernible nicely richard b murphy a executive vice president chief credit officer wintrust financial corp yeah so i think that there is going to be some good opportunity there but clearly the economic growth going forward is going to be a bit of a headwind wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i think as our line grow indiscernible million million we figured out murph is that right richard b murphy a executive vice president chief credit officer wintrust financial corp yes edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp so richard b murphy a executive vice president chief credit officer wintrust financial corp but we also have warehouse lines and as the mortgage industry were seeing really good usage on those right now and the second half of the year that probably will be under some pressure so well keep an eye on that too but well think edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp so your question about highsingle digit it could be affected by those fluctuation agree with that richard b murphy a executive vice president chief credit officer wintrust financial corp yes david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc that makes sense thanks very much edward joseph wehmer a founder president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you i am not showing any further questions at this time id now like to turn the call back over to edward wehmer for any closing remarks edward joseph wehmer founder president chief
