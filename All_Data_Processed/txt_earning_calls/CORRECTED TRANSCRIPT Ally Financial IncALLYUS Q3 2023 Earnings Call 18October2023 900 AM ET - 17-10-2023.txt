turn the call over to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you sean good morning we appreciate you joining us to review our third quarter results ill begin on slide number before we get into the quarter id like to spend a couple of minutes talking about last weeks ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 announcement that i will be leaving ally in the next few months let me start by restating my confidence in the strategic operational and financial positioning of the company as well as my deep trust in the leadership team to flawlessly execute during and after this transition period ally has delivered a remarkable transformation built an incredibly strong foundation and is positioned to thrive im honored to have led our company and my teammates through some of the incredible things weve accomplished during these nearly nine years as ceo i came to legacy gmac to help with the financial restructuring but i thought it would take three to four years nearly years later we transformed a captive finance company funded in capital markets into a leading automotive franchise the largest alldigital bank in the country and a very special brand we successfully navigated the great financial crisis returned billion to the us treasury coming out of tarp and became an investmentgrade publicly traded company starting from basically zero weve grown to billion of deposits serving million customers our auto and insurance teams serve more than dealers across the country offering them a comprehensive set of products and services that help them grow their businesses and weve consistently given back to the communities in which we work and live including the launch of the ally charitable foundation in but as ive said many times on these calls what im most proud of is the culture we build along the way its this team and this culture that will drive ally to continue to disrupt innovate and deliver value for all of our stakeholders going forward as well cover on todays call the company is stronger than ever and positioned for substantial earnings growth over the next several years leaving ally is a difficult thing to do but im excited to see the next chapter of evolution and innovation this time from the perspective of a customer i think its very important to state there was no disagreement with our board for regulatory financial or operational concern this was really the only call that could have pulled me away from leading ally my relationship with rick hendrick his family and the hendrick automotive group excites me as i transition for my final chapter over the next 20plus years ally in my entire time in the banking industry has blessed me in ways i never dreamed it has truly been an honor for me i wont say goodbye quite yet as i suspect ill be with you again in january but thank you for the support all of these years and with that lets turn to slide number to get into the quarter adjusted eps of core rotc of and revenues of billion reflect another solid quarter of execution in a dynamic environment i do want to highlight a few notable items impacting the quarter we recorded a million restructuring charge associated with a workforce reduction we expect the actions weve taken will drive million in annualized savings heading into next year as we manage towards meeting our expense target additionally we continue to evaluate ways to monetize certain tax credits and were able to realize some of those benefits this quarter with the release of valuation allowance we also realized benefits from certain state law changes while we dont expect these items to occur every quarter the tax team has done an excellent job over the years identifying ways to drive book value and capital accretion in aggregate nonrecurring tax items provided a million benefit worth per share these items are included in gaap results but weve excluded them from adjusted eps and core rotce moving to operational performance we continue to see solid results across the company within auto finance we generated record application volume of million which resulted in billion of originations and attractive riskadjusted returns originated yields for the quarter were while of our volume came from within our highest credit quality tier as we continue to capitalize on strong returns within this segment in total weve now achieved a cumulative pricing beta of in retail auto which reflects our consistent approach to dealer engagement and positions us well for yield expansion from here net chargeoffs in the quarter were basis points which was in line with guidance and up quarteroverquarter given typical seasonality russ will go into more details on credit shortly but we feel good about what were ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 seeing in terms of delinquencies flowtoloss rates and vintage performance within insurance we continue to successfully grow and deepen dealer relationships at million of earned premiums with our highest figure since turning to ally bank total deposits of billion are up billion yearoveryear we added customers in the quarter which results in on a yeartodate basis an ally record were now serving million retail deposit customers providing another proof point that our brand is resonating with consumers million active credit card holders continue to represent longterm opportunities for the business and the launch of a one ally experience will be completed in the coming months corporate finance continued to deliver accretive discipline growth as nearly of the billion portfolio is in a firstlien position on slide number we wanted to directly address some of the critical items that were navigating and whats top of mind for investors from an interest rate perspective weve talked for multiple quarters about the nearterm challenges of a rapidly rising rate environment operationally throughout this cycle the businesses have been disciplined in managing pricing on both sides of the balance sheet weve also leveraged our strong alco processes including an active hedging program to soften the financial impact from higher for longer rate scenarios beyond the nearterm pressure the momentum we have on the asset side of the balance sheet positions us well for margin expansion when rates stabilize actively managing credit risk remains a top priority weve refined our buybox to eliminate underperforming segments and added significant price particularly in riskier segments to compensate for potential volatility based on where we see things today wed expect retail auto ncos of for the full year which is in line with the range we provided in january this is a unique environment where unemployment remains historically low however persistent inflation is a challenge for many consumers delinquencies remain a watch item but we saw another quarter of shallowing in terms of yearover year change and flowtoloss rates remain strong and consistent with prior guides we assume a meaningful stepdown in used vehicle values for the remainder of the year the investments in data science and technology weve made within our collections and servicing teams will drive solid performance even in a challenging environment we have a much deeper understanding of consumer payment patterns and more options to get consumers current and staying in their cars given the nearterm revenue pressure we further heightened our focus on expenses looking to well continue making prudent investments but see a path for less than controllable expense growth and roughly on a total expense basis ill share more details in a few pages on the regulatory front we continue to evaluate the proposals released in recent months and are preparing for increased capital and liquidity across the industry however we believe that regulators should fully study the implications of these proposals and we are working closely with bpi and other advocacy partners we will continue to be disciplined in allocating capital across our various businesses to optimize riskadjusted returns slide number shows the success weve had creating scale across ally bank and deepening relationships with engaged customers as mentioned yeartodate customer growth of is an ally record and we now have million retail deposit customers who hold billion in balances the portfolio is granular diversified and of balances are fdicinsured customer retention has held steady at reflecting our industryleading ability to maintain relationships once customers experience ally the bottom half of the page highlights how our offerings have led to an engaged customer base and the key benefits of that engagement weve steadily grown our checking or what we call our spending product to more than million customers across that population also have a liquid savings account more than million deposit customers either leverage our smart savings tools utilize direct deposit andor have an ally invest relationship were approaching multiproduct customers across the consumer bank as ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 weve seen consistent adoption from deposit customers across invest home and card the benefit of engagement is meaningful as an example deposit customers who also have an invest relationship have a balance two times those who dont our brand digital offerings and customer experience continues to hit the mark and we remain optimistic about the growth potential within the consumer bank moving forward moving to slide number weve provided a snapshot of our current funding stack and available liquidity were corefunded with deposits as they account for of our funding but importantly we have multiple sources of liquidity beyond deposits on the right side we show total available liquidity of billion representing times uninsured deposit balances we meaningfully increased our capacity at the discount window within the quarter to further strengthen the quality of our contingent liquidity we pledged auto finance econtracts at the discount window for the first time and are appreciative for the engagement with the federal reserve as we work together through that process the events of march emphasized again the importance of contingency planning and ensuring multiple avenues of liquidity being available at all times the foundation of our funding profile is a mature consumer deposits franchise and we maintain access to multiple other sources of liquidity including a solid and stable relationship with the home loan bank slide number provides a summary of how were thinking about recently proposed changes to the regulatory environment for ally the most meaningful impact of the basel iii endgame proposal is the phasein of oci as a reminder we have not reinvested in the afs portfolio in over a year and expect natural oci accretion of around million aftertax annually assuming the forward curve plays out in terms of the proposed changes to rwa our net impact is not material as the addition of operational risk rwa is effectively offset by a lower risk weight on retail exposures including our retail auto portfolio im confident we can naturally build capital to meet increased requirements in advance of the proposed implementation periods the proposed requirements for longterm debt would result in incremental issuance for ally given all our longterm debt sits at the parent company the amount of issuance will depend on several factors as we optimize parent and banklevel liquidity positions on all these issues were actively engaged in our industry response including coordination with peer banks and the bank policy institute we will continue to evaluate the regulatory landscape and adapt as needed but feel comfortable in our ability to navigate the changes given our strong liquidity and capital position lets turn to slide number to talk about our expense outlook as we previewed on the second quarter earnings call were committed to growth for the expenses we can control when factoring things like fdic fees and insurance commissions and losses we expect total operating expense growth of around we have taken specific actions over the past year to reduce expense growth including a hiring freeze in mid2022 and a reduction in workforce in recent weeks its also important to keep in mind that expense ph growth this year was impacted by the normalization of weather losses and consumer credit losses in total we still anticipate expenses a little over billion and given the actions weve taken todate we expect to be right around billion so around million of growth with of that coming in the form of noncontrollable items well continue to make the right investments to fuel the company for the longterm but the specific actions weve taken and continued focus on efficiency are driving us to very modest growth in total with that ill turn it over to russ to go through the detailed financial results russell e hutchinson chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you jb good morning everyone ill begin on slide net financing revenue of billion was down yearoveryear driven by the continued pressure on funding costs given increased shortterm rates as the majority ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 of our consumer deposit portfolio is comprised of liquid products while the strong pricing momentum weve demonstrated on the asset side of the balance sheet partially mitigates the nearterm compression and sets us up for strong nim expansion well come back to nim expansion in a few slides adjusted other revenue of million increased yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter reflecting momentum within our insurance business as well as our smartauction and passthrough initiatives in auto finance which we highlighted last quarter despite modest investment gains were effectively at the million quarterly run rate weve previously alluded to and continue to see opportunities for expansion ahead provision expense of million was up quarteroverquarter reflecting seasonal trends and a modest reserve build to support asset growth retail ncos were in line with prior guidance ill provide a more granular update on retail auto credit shortly noninterest expense of billion reflects higher costs within auto finance relating to application volume and higher repo cost seen across the industry record application volume drove higher variable costs within auto finance but has enabled us to achieve a nearly pricing beta throughout the tightening cycle the incremental revenue driven by the strength of our pricing significantly exceeds the marginal expense of increased application flow weve also seen higher pricing from thirdparty vendors when vehicles go to repossession we remain focused on minimizing net credit losses and bottom line impacts to ally despite these headwinds the yearoveryear growth in expenses slowed this quarter as our efficiency initiatives begin to take hold as jb covered our recent actions to reduce costs position us for million in annual life savings next year and the anticipated yearoveryear growth reflects our ability to navigate the nearterm revenue headwinds brought on by the higher interest rate environment weve called out the million of restructuring costs which have been excluded from core pretax results gaap and adjusted eps for the quarter were and respectively weve excluded the benefit of certain tax planning strategies from adjusted eps to better reflect underlying recurring results but these tax benefits are a nice boost to capital generation moving to slide net interest margin of was down basis points quarteroverquarter momentum within earning asset yields continued in the quarter but was offset by deposit cost as the osa rate moved up within the quarter total average loans and leases of billion were up billion yearoveryear driven by growth within commercial and retail auto balances quarteroverquarter growth of billion reflects our disciplined capital deployment as we focus on accretive riskadjusted returns when originating earning asset yield of increased basis points quarteroverquarter and more than basis points yearoveryear given the cumulative impact of trends weve discussed previously including retail auto portfolio yield expansion the increasing contribution from higheryielding assets and over billion of floating rate exposure across our commercial loan and hedging portfolios retail portfolio yield continued to expand this quarter as recent vintages comprised a larger proportion of the portfolio ill talk more about retail auto portfolio yield dynamics later commercial portfolio yields expanded alongside benchmark rates given their floating rate nature turning to liabilities cost of funds continued to increase but the rate of change on both the quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear basis slowed relative to as we approach the end of the tightening cycle competition for deposits remains intense and market pricing increased within the quarter but we have remained disciplined on pricing the themes of our nim trajectory are largely unchanged we expect nim to trough a couple quarters after rates stabilize followed by gradual expansion each quarter even without the benefit of rate cuts moving to slide our cet1 ratio increased quarteroverquarter to given our disciplined approach to capital allocation our tce ratio of includes unrealized losses within our afs securities portfolio which increased this quarter given the shift in longterm rates based on the current forward curve we expect around million per year of after tax oci accretion as we allow the portfolio to roll off we announced another quarterly common dividend of for the fourth quarter ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 and as mentioned earlier the outlook for loan growth is modest and will be primarily comprised of auto assets at attractive riskadjusted levels at current levels we exceed our regulatory minimum for cet1 by billion lets turn to slide to review asset quality trends consolidated net chargeoffs of basis points increased quarteroverquarter given typical seasonal trends retail auto net chargeoffs of basis points were in line with the prior guidance of to we continue to see modestly offsetting impacts of slightly elevated delinquencies and favorable flowtoloss trends severity levels were elevated early in the quarter reflecting softer used values that strengthened in september in the bottom right 30day delinquencies increased seasonally but the yearoveryear change continues to decline delinquencies will increase seasonally in the fourth quarter and we continue to assess the impacts of inflation but remain comfortable with our fullyear nco guidance ill cover retail auto credit in more detail shortly slide shows that consolidated coverage increased basis point to the total reserve balance of billion was relatively flat quarteroverquarter and is billion higher than cecl day1 our macro assumptions assume worsening employment conditions with unemployment reaching next year before increasing beyond under our reversion to historical mean methodology retail auto coverage was flat at and remains well above the on cecl day1 the remaining weighted average life of our retail auto portfolio remains under two years reflecting the coverage we have for expected lifetime losses of this portfolio turning to slide we remain focused on leveraging our differentiated goto market approach coupling hightech and hightouch which has generated significant scale and a competitive advantage record application flow enables us to be dynamic and selective in what we originate and continues to drive strong riskadjusted returns ending assets in the top right were up slightly quarteroverquarter as commercial balances gradually increased alongside modest growth in retail auto originations of billion on the bottom of the page demonstrates the scale of our franchise and the compelling volume were able to generate given application volume despite tighter underwriting criteria given yeartodate volumes slightly above billion we remain on track to originate around billion this year in total consumer originations additionally used comprised of originations which was up modestly quarter overquarter and highlights our ability to navigate industry disruptions in new vehicle production nonprime again represents less than of retail originations in the quarter lets move to slide to talk about the scale of our auto franchise put simply our goal is to help our dealers sell as many cars and trucks as possible we encourage them to send us all of their application volume increased application volume means increased incremental work and cost on our side but enables us to be selective on what we choose to originate in terms of credit criteria and pricing this year we will decision million applications or billion in potential in loan volume by optimizing within that application volume we are on track to book around billion in consumer volume billion in retail auto loans at an estimated yield with approximately of the volume in our highest credit tier accessing million applications is a result of unique scale and strong mutually beneficial relationships with our dealer customers and that scale allows us to adapt quickly to changing market conditions like we did when returns in superprime volume became more attractive earlier this year our ability to pivot up and down the credit mix should also give you more confidence in our ability to continue booking very strong yields going forward well continue to leverage our platform to optimize our capital allocation within the auto business lets move to slide which highlights the tailwinds embedded in our retail auto portfolio throughout this tightening cycle weve demonstrated strong pricing on both sides of our balance sheet with retail auto beta around and a deposits beta around while origination pricing has been strong the majority of the portfolio is yielding or less only of the portfolio was originated this year as we continue to originate ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 loans at todays pricing the runoff of lower yielding vintages being replaced by current originations drive natural yield expansion on our largest asset class assuming stable originated yields turnover is projected to drive the portfolio to in and to in on an billion portfolio that yield expansion drives meaningful revenue growth over the medium term obviously the path of interest rates and the credit mix of our originations will impact the eventual yield migration but we remain confident retail portfolio yield will meaningfully increase over the next couple of years on slide we provide context around retail auto credit trends todate as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter as noted previously we ended the quarter with ncos of in line with expectations additionally the fullyear outlook remains on track for losses of the drivers of performance are consistent with what weve shared on recent earnings calls we continue to monitor delinquency levels which have been elevated this year but importantly flowtoloss rates remain well below prepandemic levels and have been consistent throughout the year and vintage performance trends have been encouraging loans originated last year show improving trends as they season and our strategic shift into higher credit quality loans will ultimately reduce portfolio loss content on the bottom left weve again provided quarterly loss expectations which results in a fullyear loss of around weve lowered the bottom end of our fourth quarter loss rate expectation given the support and used values we expect from the uaw strike which ill cover on the next page on the bottom right we show the yearoveryear change in 30day delinquency rates which has declined again for the third quarter in a row slide provides our latest view of used vehicle values given performance yeartodate which has resulted in values flat relative to yearend following a decline in the third quarter we continue to embed a conservative outlook for used values and maintain our longerterm outlook for declines but the uaw strike is expected to provide support near term we are currently forecasting a decline in the fourth quarter and thereby on a full year basis as well and a longdated strike could create a nearterm support for used vehicle values but would also pressure floorplan balances and our insurance business so the net pl impact is immaterial overall lets move to slide to cover auto segment results pretax income of million reflected pricing momentum alongside higher provision and noninterest expense provision reflected typical seasonality while expenses were the result of elevated repo costs across the industry and requisite spend to support the strength and scale we just highlighted on the bottom left weve highlighted the consistent progression in portfolio yields up more than basis points yearoveryear despite the progression todate the portfolio is still well below recent originated yields once again highlighting the prospective tailwinds to earning assets the bottom right chart summarizes lease portfolio trends gains declined quarteroverquarter but were favorable yearoveryear given the decline in dealer and lessee buyouts and we continue to stress the nearterm net impact from the uaw strike as used values are supported but tighter supply could lead to elevated dealer and lessee buyouts turning to insurance on slide core pretax income of million was a result of the highest earned premium revenue since partially offset by elevated loss activity given the highest severe weather activity since the reinsurance we have in place kept our exposure but weather was still a headwind given favorability seen in the prior year our proactive engagement with dealers to mitigate losses was on display again in the third quarter initial estimates for property losses from hurricane idalia exceed billion but given our actions we didnt incur any losses from the storm named storms often give dealers the time to move inventories but this still takes a lot of coordination the challenges one faced are the violent hail and windstorms with little warning and that was more what was encountered in the previous quarter written premiums of million increased yearoveryear as we remain focused on increasing dealer relationships and benefit from normalizing inventory levels our focus ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 remains on leveraging the scale weve established within auto finance and highlighting our full spectrum product suite to dealers driving further integration of insurance across our auto dealer base turning to slide retail deposits of billion increased billion quarteroverquarter and billion yearoveryear demonstrating the strength and resilience of our leading franchise total deposits of billion were up billion yearoveryear netnew customers was our 58th consecutive quarter of growth and yeartodate customer growth of is the highest in ally banks history is on track for the highest annual customer growth in ally banks history as customers become increasingly aware of the opportunity to earn more on their savings and the value ally provides beyond rates and we continue to see strong growth in multiproduct customers which has grown by annually over the past several years the continued evolution in consumer preferences driving the migration towards digital offerings provides a tailwind for continued growth across the entirety of our customer base and products suite moving to slide our digital bank platforms provide diversification and deepen customer relationships ally invest complements the deposit franchise well as we once again saw of new account openings from existing customers as they leverage the ease of money movement between accounts within ally ally credit card added new cardholders in the quarter now million strong as we prudently grow the portfolio the continued integration and launch of one ally in the fourth quarter will accelerate our ability to deepen relationships across allys product suite ally lending balances were relatively flat given our disciplined approach to underwriting and capital allocation corporate finance results are on slide core pretax income of million was up million quarteroverquarter benefiting from higher interest rates given the entire portfolio is floating rate the yearoveryear comparison was down slightly as an investment gain in the prioryear period did not repeat but was largely offset by accretive disciplined asset growth the portfolio remains highquality with assetbased and of loans are in a first lien position our hfi portfolio balance of billion shows modest growth reflecting the teams discipline and focus on maximizing riskadjusted returns slide includes details for mortgage finance mortgage generated pretax income of million and million of directtoconsumer origination expenses were down million yearoveryear highlighting the benefits of a variable cost ph margin model more than half of our origination volume came from existing deposit customers highlighting the benefits of our one ally experience and deepened customer relationships we remain focused on a great experience for customers rather than a specific origination target slide contains our current financial outlook for the operating environment remains dynamic and interest rate volatility persists increasing the difficulty in providing granular guidance but were committed to maintaining a transparent approach to guidance based on what we know currently youll notice the page is largely unchanged versus the outlook weve provided in july assuming a forward curve from quarter end peak fed fund is unchanged versus guidance at but cuts have been pushed out considerably continued competition for deposits has put incremental pressure on portfolio yield which could tick up to in the fourth quarter and we see fullyear nim above likely in the area our expectation for full year other revenue remains billion and importantly were achieving the million quarterly run rate we guided to in january and as we covered previously retail auto portfolio yield is still projected around in the fourth quarter with continued expansion thereafter retail ncos are expected to be at for the full year unchanged from prior guidance and no change to operating expense guidance as we limit spend to nondiscretionary costs and essential investments we see the tax rate closer to for the year given some of the tax planning items that hit in we expect our nearterm effective tax rate to return to approximately absent tax planning items as weve had solid momentum in generating ev tax credits and expect that trend to continue while elevated and ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 increasing interest rates are a headwind we expect most of the tightening cycle is behind us and have positioned the balance sheet for margin and earnings growth over the medium term and remain confident in our ability to continue to execute and drive longterm profitability from my perspective jbs news last week was a bit of a surprise but when you unpack it and also realize his love for cars and the hendrick group this was simply the right next step for him we are going to miss jb dearly and at the same time were excited for him jbs news in no way changes how i feel about the opportunity or ally i am excited for all that we have to accomplish my fantastic teammates and allys attractive financial outlook the scale businesses are in an enviable position i remember talking to jb and the team about the moat positions and its clear that those have been established today and with that ill turn it back to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you russ i will certainly miss you and this entire team as well the strategic priorities which guide everything we do are unwavering and essential for our longterm success first and foremost is ensuring we maintain strong alignment between our culture and our stakeholders were focused on highlighting the differentiated offerings across our businesses for both consumer and commercial customers well continue finding ways to disrupt the industry and remove friction for customers by delivering leading digital experiences and even more important in this dynamic environment is our disciplined approach to risk management and capital allocation im confident these priorities and this management team will help us deliver value for all stakeholders and with that sean back to you we can head into qa sean leary headinvestor relations enterprise fpa ally financial inc thank you jb as we head into qa we do ask that participants limit yourself to one question and one followup carmen please begin the qa ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you sean operator instructions it comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs please proceed ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc jb obviously you gave a lot of color on the decision to exit the company maybe just to dig a tiny bit deeper did your view of the returns that the company is capable of generating over an intermediate timeframe impact the decision at all and if not do you still believe midteens and of eps over time are still the right levels for this company over time jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah ryan thanks for the question no financial outlook did not change or drive my decision in any way shape or form i feel even more confident in the financial profile of the company going forward i think obviously rates as russ and i both alluded to have been a big factor in driving some of the margin squeeze that we faced but as you start to roll the balance sheet forward and i think we try to include three or four new slides this time it really hit those points as you start to roll the balance sheet forward i mean youre going to be 4plus type and then easily into the midteens so this was not driven at all about any change in confidence on the strategic outlook the financial outlook i think as you heard me say this is indiscernible ally for nine years i had no real intentions to go but this was one call that i talked to my board about for really the past two years that if this call ever came that would be the one call id probably take and at least listen to and obviously life sometimes throws you curveballs and thats what happened in this scenario but mr hendrick and the hendrick automotive group theyre unbelievable people and partners obviously we touch so many thousands of dealers day in and day out and this is really the premier franchise thats out there im respectful of all of our dealer partners but this was really a dream opportunity for me to go work with a man a family a company that i have got to know for a number of years that i deeply love and admire i mean its a big business north of billion in annual revenues they sell cars big parts player big work in the defense industry as well so it just so it fit in so many reasons for me to make this personal decision it is hard to leave ally a lot of great teammates and certainly that weighed on me as i made this decision but nothing about the financial outlook the strategic outlook and frankly i think the next ceo that comes is going to have a financial profile thats pretty damn attractive going forward and so sorry for the longwinded response ryan but thats really what drove this ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 no change in my view or my degree of confidence and its going to be fun being an awfully big ally customer now too ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it no appreciate all the color on that jb so russ hope all is well and maybe you can dig in on the net interest margin i know you noted that nim will trough a couple of quarters after rates stabilize and i think you said around for the full year which i think implies a couple of basis points decline in the fourth quarter so can you maybe just russ maybe just flesh out a little bit the nearterm margin dynamics do you think is the trough and then can you maybe just unpack some of the numbers in the trajectory of the nim under either higher for longer or the forward curve which obviously seems to be implying two to three cuts for next year russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure thanks ryan look i think youre spot on in terms of thinking about and i think youre spot on with the commentary in terms of rates troughing within a couple of quarters i think the key question there is where do rates go from here and i think we are under the view that we are towards the end of the tightening cycle and so to the extent that were already there i think we could see rates start to expand through the first half of next year so you could see nim start to expand in the first half of next year to the extent that were not quite there but close to it that expansion could be delayed all that being said i think as jb pointed out as i pointed out earlier the dynamics of our portfolio and that replacement of facts that we pointed out in some of the pages earlier is strong and its real and in our view it is a question of timing in terms of rate expansion as opposed to a question of ifs and i would say and we like to think about things here in terms of a stable rate environment so a higher for longer scenario and in that context wed expect to basis points to basis points per quarter of nim expansion and obviously as you say to the extent that we see cuts on the short end we could see that expansion expedited ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it i appreciate all the color jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks ryan operator thank you one moment for our next question please and it comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw please proceed sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning jb congrats on your new role jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 hey morning sanjay thank you sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah its been quite a ride maybe you guys can talk about where we are with the ceo search and what the criteria might be is it internal external any leaning in terms of that jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah sanjay thanks id still say a bit of the early stages i had obviously talked to my chair of the board when i was considering this so the board and our search committee had a bit of time to sort of start structuring their own thoughts about what a candidate profile would look like all those things so that is underway obviously now and the timing of this was really related we had our board meeting last week and at that meeting that was when i officially submitted my notice to leave the firm at that point in time and so obviously we went public last wednesday with this but id say the board is doing a great job im excited to be able to say ill be involved in that process and thats very important to me in finding the right type of leader in partnership with our board to really carry ally forward for the next years so its obviously easier things are out in the public domain that you can conduct an external search were working with a leading global search firm and so thats underway and i think our board is very focused on trying to get somebody that can really carry the culture of the company forward and also can continue to transform the business im very proud of whats been accomplished over nine years but as ive said to every one of my leaders and all of our employees and our board its never about one person this has always been this transformation has been led by an incredible team and i am fully confident in their ability to continue executing in this next chapter so i think a new leader will come in recognizing they have an exceptionally strong management team they have a hungry employee base and all of us believe we ally has never really fully got the credit for the transformation thats been executed and i think thats going to be a neat opportunity for our next leader to go and crack and so its underway sanjay ive obviously said i would be here through the end of january if needed i suspect that timing is going to be right around the mark of when well bring in a new leader but obviously im going to be a very close customer of ally and its in my interest to ensure we get a great leader a transformational leader a culture carrier a servant leader all those things that i think ive tried to be here we get somebody thats even going to take that to the next level so its underway and i would hope by the end of january youll be talking to our next ceo sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay perfect and then my followup question appreciate slide that sort of goes through all the implications of the proposed regulation but maybe if we take a step russ could you just maybe over the next two years how should we practically think it flows through the pl and the balance sheet what specific lines does it impact i mean maybe theres debt issuance obviously capital return maybe you can just talk about how we should think about that over the next couple of years thanks russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure thanks sanjay its a great question its obviously one thats complicated by the fact that these are proposals and as jb mentioned earlier were working with bpi and other industry constituents to make sure our ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 feedback is reflected and as youve heard the industry has had a reaction to the proposals as theyre currently stated all that being said and maybe ill start with basel iii endgame the biggest impact for us is in terms of our aoci and ill just make it clear we can manage within that transition time period that its been proposed so far without doing anything unnatural that is we can manage it organically as you can imagine it its obviously curtailed our share repurchases and quite frankly if you look at our auto business youre just looking at the attractiveness of the assets that were seeing from our dealer partners but we have certainly had to be restrained in terms of our origination volume and its also forced us to really make hard decisions around the growth trajectory of some of our growth businesses all that being said we can manage within the timeframe thats been provided and the only significant real impact for us on the capital line is that aoci inclusion when you look at longterm debt and its very early and as jb laid out on his slide the binding requirement for us is the of idi at the bank level because as you can imagine our unsecured debt is issued at our holding company level we actually dont have unsecured debt at the bank level today and so thats going to require us to as the proposal is currently stated its going to require us to really look through the liquidity we have at the holdco versus the bank level and look at our issuance and that could drive incremental issuance from where we sit today which would obviously come with additional interest expense sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then i mean just in terms of like you could take that liquidity and invest it too so it wouldnt be the full impact right russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah absolutely correct and just to be clear when you think about basel iii endgame from an rwa perspective there are puts and takes but we dont see any significant change to our rwa that is the increase in operational rwa is completely offset by some of the benefits we see in our retail loan portfolio sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you very much operator thank you one moment for our next question please one moment its coming from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed jon please verify your mute button jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you hear me all right operator yes sir go ahead jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc weve got you now jon ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right thank you appreciate that question for you on slide just curious what the big picture messages on auto credit performance on what it sounds simple but on one hand the chargeoffs are going up on the other hand the delinquencies are going down whats the message that youre trying to send and as we look past the fourth quarter into with the delinquency numbers it feels like credit should actually be getting better is that too simple russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean maybe ill start just to try and be as clear as possible about it we very much see ourselves on track towards the nco rate that we advertised last quarter that being said theres seasonality in terms of our delinquency tracking so what you see in the bottom left on page as you see that seasonality expressed through the nco trajectory as we go from second quarter to third quarter to fourth quarter so fourth quarter is typically when we see our highest level of nco activity and so we show the to that to for the fourth quarter is consistent with a fullyear nco rate so thats an expression of the seasonality in our portfolio on the bottom right what were doing is were showing yearoveryear change to get through some of that seasonality issue so the comparisons that youre seeing as you look at each of those quarters is versus versus and so when you look at it on a yearonyear basis you can see that those elevated delinquency levels that were currently seeing you can see theyre actually coming down that yearoveryear change is coming down each quarter sequentially and has been for the last three quarters straight and we think thats a reflection of a couple of things one we implemented through curtailments and pricing a lot of changes to our portfolio recently and we are seeing that in terms of the performance of our recent vintages its early to tell were very early in those vintages but were seeing real impact to our curtailment and pricing actions on the other side of that when you look at our vintages we are seeing improvement in those vintages with respect to our original expectations as well and so again early days but we continue to see positive signs that keep us on track to that nco rate jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thats helpful russ appreciate that and then just one followup on slide the deposit rate that you had for the quarter the average you talked about intense pricing competition on deposits but if the fed is done is it as simple as that just marches to your savings rate or is there something else happening on deposit costs thanks russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc its also a great question so we raised during early in the quarter and so youll see the full impact of our latest osa raise over the course of fourth quarter and look its our expectation that because of the competition and weve always expected this we continue to see deposit competition even after the last raise and so where we are now weve and you probably noticed in the presentation when we talked about our outlook weve changed our guidance we were at overall deposit yield for fourth quarter weve moved that up now to say its to so were not ruling out the possibility of continued pressure on deposits and the possibility of increased pricing going forward ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question please all right and our next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research securities please proceed bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning and good luck jb wish you the best jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you very much bill appreciate that bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah yeah absolutely i wanted to follow up on the commentary and all the color youve already given on the nim guidance and in particular your outlook for osa rates theres been a debate around the possibility that your osa rates may continue to face upward pressure and ultimately you have to converge with the fed funds rate historically indiscernible environment ally offered rates above fed funds and i guess theres just concern that that upward pressure on deposit beta could persist as long as fed funds continues to exceed the rates that youre offering just i guess your thoughts around that and the potential for further offsets from betas on asset yields would be great russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc great look we think were at the end of the tightening cycle assuming thats true we do think theres a possibility that our osa rates tick up slightly from here but i do say its a possibility id say the trends that were seeing in our deposit book have actually been quite favorable as jb pointed out and as i mentioned during the presentation weve had a really great quarter in terms of attracting new customers were about to have a record year in fact in terms of attracting new customers to our platform we are not the highest payer right now when you look at our liquid deposit rates but again we continue to have incredible momentum with our customer base were seeing it in terms of strong retention were seeing it in terms of customers taking advantage of things like our savings toolkit and were seeing it in terms of new customer growth and so while yeah we do think that theres a possibility that we could tick up on osa pricing we think its just that it would be marginal a marginal uptick and again at this point i would characterize it as a possibility not a certain outcome bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thank you thats helpful and if i could just follow up on your commentary on capital and the impact of basel iv endgame sic basel iii endgame since the inclusion of oci aoci changes introduces volatility into regulatory capital theres been some debate around whether this could lead the banks to have to run ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 with a bigger buffer than they have historically maybe if you could just speak to any changes to your longterm capital targets or should we continue to expect sort of that range for cet1 russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah look i think there are a number of kind of puts and takes into the proposal theres obviously a lot of gold plating around certain asset classes and i would say look when i look at our management target now thats a full percentage points north of our regulatory requirement so right now were sitting at with approximately billion of excess capital relative to the regulatory minimum i feel pretty good about where our capital is and i dont anticipate any significant changes to how we manage capital going forward bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you for taking my questions operator thank you one moment please for our next question our last question comes from the line of kevin barker with piper sandler please proceed kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co great thanks for taking my questions jb best of luck at hendricks its a pleasure working with you jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you kevin likewise thank you kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co yeah i just want to follow up on the nim conversation in particular the projection for over nim at some point it seems like in now in your view given the current rate environment and the additional rules around debt issuance or potentially different basel iii changes do you expect to achieve that some time in the run rate with late or do you feel like you could achieve it sometime in early or late just given the current rate environment as you see it today russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah id say and ill address your question in a stable rate environment rather than speculate around the timing of rates but id say in a stable rate environment our expectation is still crystal clear to get to nim i think were kind of looking at the portfolio replacement impact i think you could see us there entering kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co great and then does that ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc caveat that with the view that i dont want to be in the business and speculating in terms of how our shortterm rates go kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co got it makes sense and then just a followup on your estimated origination yields do you feel like you can maintain that auto origination yields through the next foreseeable future just given the competitive environment for auto lending weve seen quite a few banks pull back from the sector in the last year but seem to be reengaged in do you feel like that is a adequate number or at least a stable competitive environment russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i do actually the pullback in competition this time around i actually think has more durability to it than what weve seen in past cycles for a number of folks this isnt a core business for them and i think that the regulatory capital pressures that other folks are on it really has forced people to make hard decisions and to really focus on the businesses that theyre best at weve certainly had to think through our capital allocation across various businesses at ally but as you know the auto finance business is absolutely core for us and so i think the pullback in competition when you look at players they havent just dialed back their originations many have exited the market altogether and i think that creates a durability to this competitive environment that were currently seeing so yeah i do think we can maintain our rates and i would just say just when you unpack our yields remember weve increased pricing at the same time that weve been tightening credit and so weve lifted the credit profile of our originations at the same time that weve increased pricing if you were to look at it on a same credit basis our pricing has actually increased significantly more than what we show in terms of this yield and the beta that weve printed so yeah i think there we have a number of levers in place and i do think that the competitive environment that were seeing now is durable and so will give us the ability to maintain that yield for a while and i dont want to speculate on rates coming down but obviously rates coming down create a tailwind for us just in terms of that portfolio replacement effect thats currently causing a headwind kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you russ sean
