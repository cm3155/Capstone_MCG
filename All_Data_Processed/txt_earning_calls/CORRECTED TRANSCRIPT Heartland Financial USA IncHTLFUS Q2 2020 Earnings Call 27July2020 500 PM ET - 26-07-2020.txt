closing most of our bank lobbies in march and april we reopened gradually on a statebystate basis shared key learnings on operations and safety we were cautiously optimistic about expanding our inperson services in may and june recent outbreaks in some states have led us to pull back and close bank lobbies again in certain locations to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers we recognize this will likely continue to occur across our footprint and our country we are prepared and confident in our ability to operate in this environment for the foreseeable future

growth from the linked quarter minnesota bank trust increased nontime deposits by and premier valley bank increased nontime deposits by branch transactions have decreased since the end of the second quarter in this was accelerated by branch lobby closures during the pandemic but also highlights the consumer behavior shift to digital while in branch service and cash transactions are declining digital usage is increasing we were prepared to respond when the fed cut interest rates in the second quarter the average rate paid on interestbearing deposits was basis points down basis points from the linked quarter our deposit pricing strategies along with our previously implemented interest rate floors on commercial loans enabled us to increase core interest margin by basis points last month

technology and personalized service for our customers turning to loans our total commercial lending portfolio increased by million which includes billion in ppp loans more specifically the commercial and business loan portfolio excluding ppp loans declined by million while commercial real estate lending grew million the primary driver of the decline in commercial lending balances was lower utilization of revolving credit lines which decreased to from resulting in a decline of million in loan balances during the quarter if line utilization would have been maintained at historical levels commercial loan growth would have been approximately million for the quarter we continued to see run off in our remaining portfolios as the agricultural portfolio declined million and residential and consumer loans decreased by a total of million from the linked quarter next ill provide an overview of our participation in the paycheck protection program heartland is proud to have helped thousands of small businesses obtain ppp loans in total we processed more than ppp loans for billion and help preserve more than jobs turning to credit we continue to see stable credit quality our nonperforming

earnings call 27jul2020 nonpass rated loans increased to from in the linked quarter excluding ppp the ratio remains at historically low levels however we are starting to see a shift in the risk ratings due to the pandemic lastly net chargeoffs for the second quarter were reported at million or basis points excluding ppp thats lower than the previous quarter number of million or basis points weve made loan modifications on billion of loans in our portfolio of these are interestonly for days and the remainder are primarily principal and interest deferments for days through closed collaboration and consultation with our customers as of july we have returned million to their original payment structure were taking proactive steps to prepare for the future and help our customers stabilize their positions based on regular conversations with customers we expect that of the remaining loan modifications will end in the third quarter we anticipate less than of the balances will require additional support through further modifications weve posted a presentation on our investor relations website that provides further details on loan modifications and exposure in covidimpacted industries the allowance for credit losses on loans increased million million of which relates to sand fracking company that operates in an industry thats been negatively impacted by the pandemic we

corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2020 bryan r mckeag chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks bruce and good afternoon ill begin today by referencing the press release which shows reported earnings per share of this quarter this includes provisions for credit losses of million and acquisition integration cost of excluding these items heartlands aftertax preprovision and acquisition and integration cost earnings per share was for the quarter one additional significant item of note was a billion of ppp loans originated during the quarter which produced million of interest and fee income and added to earnings per share so again this quarter core results were solid with financial trends and metrics also positive in almost all aspects as i mentioned the total provision for credit losses this quarter was million with approximately million of the provision attributed to the continued deterioration in the economic forecasts since the prior quarter provisions to increase reserves on individually assessed impaired loans totaled million largely related to one fracking sand credit as bruce mentioned the remaining provision of million is attributed to loan downgrades and balance changes within the portfolios in total the quarterly provision net of million in net chargeoffs resulted in a reserve bill during the quarter of just over million which represents a increase from the prior quarter reserves at quarter end the allowance for credit losses on loans was million or of the total loans and the allowance for credit losses and unfunded loan commitments was million or basis points of total loans together these two allowances result in a total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses of million or of total loss when the ppp loan balances are excluded the total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses increases basis points to of loans we used the june consensus macroeconomic baseline forecast from moodys as our most likely economic scenario as the economy outlook continues to evolve and our pandemicrelated loss profiles and experience develops we will adjust our allowance for lending losses and provisioning accordingly moving on to the rest of the balance sheet total assets grew billion ending the quarter just over billion with a loantodeposit ratio of tangible common equity ratio declined basis points to from last quarter as increases from retained earnings and the fair value marks on the bond portfolio were more than offset by the impact of a billion increase in assets that increase in assets was driven by the addition of billion in net ppp loans and a million increase in the bond portfolio excluding the impact of the ppp loans the ratio would have increased basis points to in addition on june we issued million of preferred stock which will ensure that our capital regulatory capital ratios will remain strong after the closing of the aim transaction that will trigger the collins amendment to the sarbanesoxley legislation resulting in million of trust losing to tier capital treatment investments also grew million this quarter and comprised of assets with a tax equivalent yield of a duration of just under six years and generate million of average monthly cash flow total borrowings remain low at million or of assets at june our banking network had approximately billion of unused borrowing capacity so heartlands balance sheet is very strong with solid capital base healthy loss reserves ample liquidity and low leverage all of which puts heartland in great position to successfully navigate through the turbulent economic times ahead heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2020 moving to the income statement net interest income totaled million in this quarter or million higher than the prior quarter and includes the million of interest and fee income on ppp loans the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis this quarter was or basis point higher than last quarter and includes a decline of basis points in loan yield which is largely due to the low yield on the ppp loans the lower loan yields were offset by much lower interest costs on deposits and borrowings which decreased basis points compared to last quarter the ppp loan interest income and fee income of million on average balances of million results in a yield of which lowered this quarters net interest margin by basis points this quarter the net interest margin includes basis points of purchase accounting accretion compared to basis points in the prior quarter so as a result the margin excluding purchase accounting and ppp loans was which is basis points higher than last quarter noninterest income totaled million for the quarter up million from last quarter as the gainonsales loans was up million on higher mortgage loan activity and total security gains increased million compared to last quarter moving to noninterest expense noninterest expense has continued to be wellmanaged totaling million this quarter down compared to last quarter on a core run rate basis which excludes acquisition integration and restructuring costs tax credit costs and asset gains and losses core run rate decreased million to million compared to million last quarter more specifically salary and benefits were flat at approximately million again this quarter and occupancy furniture and equipment costs totaling million also remained flat this quarter these categories account for twothirds of our core costs and have been at this level for the past nine quarters in addition ftes of also remained flat this quarter and over the last nine quarters have declined by or from a peak of ftes in the second quarter of during that same period assets have increased billion or these results demonstrate the leverage and increase productivity we have achieved as we worked to restructure the company trimmed our branch network and implemented the many customer compass productivity improvements we identified over the past two years all while continuing the companys significant growth as a result the efficiency ratio as lynn and bruce mentioned improved significantly this quarter coming in at for the quarter which is an over basis points improvement from last quarter and over basis points better in the same quarter last year the effective tax rate for the quarter was compared to last quarter with the decline being primarily due to higher tax credits recognized this quarter now with regard to upcoming ma activities the aimbank acquisition which is due to close in q3 will have the following impacts first loans held to maturity will increase about billion net of an estimated loan mark in a to range and investment should increase about million total deposits will increase nearly billion with approximately million in noninterest bearing accounts aim carries a net interest margin of in the range has non has core noninterest income run rate of approximately million per quarter net of durbin and an noninterest expense run rate before cost saves of million to million per quarter second at closing we will issue approximately million shares of heartland common stock we are currently estimating goodwill of million to million and the core deposit intangible of million to million these estimates could change once all the fair value marks are finalized and will primarily depend on heartlands stock price at the closing date heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2020 third we expect integration and conversion costs will be near million spread over the next two quarters and with the system conversion currently planned for midfourth quarter we will not begin to realize the full benefit of the estimated cost saves until the first quarter of finally with regards to the acquisition of the four johnson bank branches in arizona which is expected to close and convert to our systems in early december we are currently estimating that loans will increase by million to million and deposits will increase by million to million with to being in noninterest bearing accounts we are currently estimating goodwill of million to million and deposit intangibles of million to million noninterest income run rate is expected to be to per month and noninterest expense run rates are million to million per month the integration and conversion costs will be between million and million and should be largely booked in the fourth quarter of and with that ill turn the call back over to bruce for questions bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc well now take questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jeff rulis from da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co thanks good afternoon bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi jeff good afternoon jeff bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hey jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co hi there i think bryan thanks for the detail at the end there youve kind of rattled through and i just wanted to confirm a couple of things the aim closing more specifically in the quarter is it looking kind of early mid late on that one heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2020 bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i would say for you guys i would probably not put much in for aim this quarter it might we might get a month we might get a half a month well see so i think youre really looking at a fourth quarter from a financial impact to your model does that helps jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co sure that does and then i think youve rattled through the i missed the arizona branch contribution on non interest income and noninterest expense that was on a monthly basis bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i did that on a monthly basis since were closing in early december so if you want to ph pick up a month and that was for noninterest income to per month and noninterest expense is to per month jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co great okay thanks and i wanted to maybe circle back on the what was the cost of funds and really the decline in that level pretty impressive i guess was there anything other kind of onetime in there or was it just sort of continued decline in borrowings and good success on lowering other core deposits if you could just speak to that because i think that was a pretty big effort in quarter bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah jeff i would say that we were prepared we had our banks were ready for the fed cuts so we acted very quickly and we basically after the second cut went to zero really the only thing that were paying significant amounts of interest ph on right now are certificates of deposit and it will be bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc ph this all will down over time bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc as were now offering our new offering rates much lower as well bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2020 so there was nothing onetime in there at all it was just quick action and preparation by our banks when the fed cuts occurred and we did get the benefit of the loans hitting floors that also helped which weve been talking about that for over a year jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co yeah and then i guess just the outlook on margin that i ex the ph ex aim aim i think is on a core basis a little higher and youve got some flexibility there but just on a core basis what do you think you had from here bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think on the core we should be able to keep it somewhere where it are where it is to maybe down to so you might see or basis points i mean things are going to grind down as we go forward as loans continue to reprice and the bond portfolio as that cash flow has to get reinvested is going to grind it down somewhat so i think next quarter if we saw core and then you have ppp and you have purchase accounting might be come back to or so for a reported nim and then aim might help a little bit in the quarter but it will help in the fourth quarter for sure jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co okay bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i havent ph funded that all together it might help a tick or two given its relative size jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co okay and i guess triggered one last question just the timing on the ppe what i guess what are you modeling for i guess forgiveness or what do you think you carry in the balance at the end of the year any internal projections bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah its really hard to project i think our thoughts are and bruce you can jump in here we probably see to should be forgiven and i think thats going to be a fourth largely a fourth quarter maybe some into the first quarter of event we might get a few in the third quarter but i think its going to be largely fourth quarter and then some into the first quarter before we get them all done so i think thats the most we know right now jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co okay thanks for all the detail operator your next question comes from terry mcevoy from stephens your line is open heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2020 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon everybody bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi terry bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc maybe if you could just talk about some regional differences across your franchise specific to the covid19 portfolio bruce in your prepared remarks you talked about kind of an opening and then a closing in certain markets and i was just wondering from a high level if you had noticed any regional differences bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah great question terry i would say in the loan portfolio were really not seeing much of a regional difference at all but certainly from consumer behaviors and our opening and kind of closing we definitely saw that we saw it in texas where were currently operating with no lobbies open and we saw it in arizona where we also closed all of our lobbies there we also closed some lobbies in colorado although theyre still operating with i believe of our branches there the lobbies are also open but we really havent seen it on the loan side we really are seeing it more on the transaction in which branches are open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you and then as a followup the reserve ratio increased again in the second quarter the commentary right from the press release said expect higher chargeoffs and higher nonperforming loans so i guess with that backdrop with that assumption does that suggest additional reserve build in the third and fourth quarter or was that captured here in the second quarter bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i would say its again hard to gauge but i think our reserve build is going to slow down and were probably going to see chargeoffs pick up a bit and so use up some of that reserve i could see us covering chargeoffs maybe a little bit more in provisions but hopefully it really depends on what the economy is going to do if that lengthens out and we have a continuing lag of poor economic results obviously the reserve wont be able to come down and well have to maintain it even if we have chargeoffs so but i dont think youre going to see the size of builds that we had the first two quarters certainly maybe a little bit in the third quarter but after that if things go the way they should we should see flat to starting to use some of the reserve against losses that actually come that we expected as we built the reserve heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2020 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks thanks for taking my questions and pretty impressive job by you guys lowering the deposit costs there im sure that it didnt ph come to be sure so just wanted to know jeffs question earlier thank you bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks terry bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks terry operator your next question comes from andrew liesch from piper sandler your line is open andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon everyone bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi andrew andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co questions hi on the mortgage side the gainonsale was this driven by improvements in the gainonsale premium or was it volume what was the driver behind that bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think it was probably a little bit of both we did have great volumes and because the great volumes we were probably able to push our margins a little more and so i think we did get both so i mean the guys at primewest really did a great job this quarter getting to that number were hoping they can keep that rolling and well see if the economy if the housing market is as strong as it appears like everybody says its going to be we hope that itll continue for another quarter and then youll get the seasonal dropoff i think like we would normally get bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah theyre seeing there their rate locks continue to be very strong and their margins theyve been able to really increase margins so but we feel that theyre going to have another pretty strong quarter here in the third quarter heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2020 andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got you and then did i hear you correctly that the shares issued for aimbank of about ph million is that correct bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah janet pointed out i misread that its million i was reading andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co okay very good bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc very fast and got numbers transposed sorry about that andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co all right i thought i had missed something that had gotten on over the last few months but okay good to know bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc no no no andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co and then if you just look at the deferrals and what your borrowers are telling you and it sounds like a small portion of them will remain on deferral or maybe need for more deferral period but at what point do you think that thats when you start to see chargeoffs right or ph criticized bonds increases is that going to be later this year and really what would what would trigger you guys are started making large more downgrades in these loan types bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah were making downgrades as some of the borrowers are asking for additional support so even if we make an additional 90day modification youll probably start to see downgrades but when they would move into either chargeoffs or nonaccruals it would probably be after that next days so we really think that its related a little bit to the reserve build on the question that terry asked it probably will depend a lot on what happens to those modifications and whether its the that we anticipate or whether its better than that as to how that reserve build occurs bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2020 and the economy and how things open up or have to reclose is going to play a big as you would guess will play a big ph in that004517 and then government programs bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah and it really depends on the stimulus package that theyre talking about in washington and who that supports andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co right right great that covers all my questions thanks so much bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks operator your next question comes from damon delmonte from kbw your line is open damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon guys hows everybody doing today bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc good damon bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc great damon damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good to hear so just a question on credit a little bit so part of the provision you said was for million for frackingrelated credit what was the size of the total credit bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc about million damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and can you disclose where that was located bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2020 its in the upper midwest its where the sand the white sands come from damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got you okay so i see youve provided million towards the million so pretty healthy reserve there do you expect a favorable resolution on this or you guys kind of thinking that its probably going to be charged off next quarter bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i think in the next two quarters it will resolve probably bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah it happened very very quickly at the end of last quarter the loan was current and the market turned quickly and we are in negotiation but are prepared to begin liquidating if necessary so thats why we took the significant reserve and i think it will definitely resolve itself before the end of the year i would hate to say exactly which quarter indiscernible bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc sizeable charge offs bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc right damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right and then securities went up by a decent amount this quarter can you just give a little perspective on the thought process there bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i mean we just have so much liquidity damon with the deposits growing the way they did and we grew the ppp money came in moved over to deposits primarily and then we grew an additional million500 million past that and we were liquid already so yeah zac had a lot of money to put to work as treasurer of the company and so were trying to get that yet still stay liquid because money could flow the other way fairly quickly depending upon how the economy goes so it really was that we just had a really great deposit quarter bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah and damon couple of other things that were thinking about through this process is corporations companies businesses shrank their balance sheets generated cash paid down lines and then theres a whole heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2020 bunch of cash on our balance sheet we dont know what all the burn rates are there plus if ppp starts to get forgiven were going to get all that cash back so were trying to be very conservative in our estimates right now more liquid than we would normally be damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got you okay and then i guess just lastly on expenses bryan obviously you have couple of moving parts with the aim deal closing and then later on with the arizona but what are you thinking about the core expense run rate kind of going forward from here bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah if i were to say i think our core is at million today i think thats going to be close to that might get a little bit with aim maybe one month at most so you might get million million added to that if they come in october or september sorry then the next quarter i still think the core of heartland is going to stay relatively flat at that million but then youre going to add another million probably on for aim so you could be at million of core there and then maybe one month of million or so with the addition of johnson branch so you could be million to million so i think we can do maybe better than that but thats what i would say is pretty reasonable right now damon delmonte q analyst keefe

all that i had thank you very much for taking my question bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc sure bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks damon operator your next question comes from david long from raymond james your line is open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you good afternoon everyone bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi david bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hi david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2020 hey just looking at your affected industries affected by the covid19 and i see lodging at little over of loans restaurant bars industries that may be impacted for an extended period of time so my question is when youre talking about the deferrals and youve got day deferrals out there youve got another day going how do you foresee things playing out after you get to days bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc well the first thing is we have to get through the first days which we are not all the way through all of these borrowers because many of them are just coming off here and theyll come off in july and august for their first days and it really depends i mean theyre all responding very differently and thats honestly its a little bit of the unknown that were going through this and lodging it depends the type of facility it is and where its located and if its in any sort of a recreational area were seeing occupancies above breakeven if its in a kind of a downtown center that was more business travel i mean theyre still struggling so everyone is a little different and it also depends on the sponsor and the liquidity that they have so im not really sure i can give you as a group guidance there bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i mean i do think david what we said in our comments is we would see maybe a third left having to get kind of reopt for another days and then when you get to the end of that second days we have to make if anybody still needs modifications thats going to be a fairly hard discussion because i think then well be in the troubled debt restructuring territory and a lot of other things so i think youre going to see a dwindling number now if the economy doesnt get better and support doesnt work or whatever then youve got a whole different ballgame but kind of what we think will happen now based on the economic forecasts showing an improvement as we kind of move out of last half of the year thats kind of our general thought right now david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc okay as a followup have you had discussions with your regulators at this point about how youd be treating those from an accounting perspective after the days assuming just thinking worst case scenario and you had some of that had to go past that if you had discussions on how that would be accounted for is that still to be determined bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc we havent talked to the regulators i know when weve talked to our accountants kpmg we kind of think when we get past days were going to have to do an assessment for tdrs from a bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc right bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2020 gaap perspective now whether the regulators will give us any different treatment from regulatory i havent heard anything different but i think for accounting purposes after days were going to have to anything thats still being modified is going to have to go through a tdr review david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks for the color appreciate it operator thank you as
