reconciliation of the nongaap measures to the comparable gaap measures will be available on pinnacle financials website at wwwpnfpcom with that i will now turn this presentation over to mr terry turner pinnacles president and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you operator and thank you for joining us to get started here i think third quarter was an outstanding quarter for us with key success measures like asset quality core deposit growth fee growth preprovision net revenue growth intangible book value accretion were all very strong during the quarter we begin every quarterly call with this dashboard reflecting our gaap measures but honestly theres so many adjustments required in order to focus on the variables that were truly managing to here at pinnacle that i will move quickly to the chart reflecting the adjusted nongaap measures as you can see here total revenues fully delivered eps and adjusted ppnr are all up meaningfully on a linked quarter basis revenues are up roughly yearoveryear at a time when many of them predicting banks cannot earn in what they earned in were proud that fully diluted eps is already back to the level for the third quarter of and most importantly since ppnr has become our primary focus during this pandemic and for the remainder of adjusted ppnr is up nearly over the same quarter last year and roughly on a linkedquarter annualized basis loan growth of yearoveryear for the third quarter they were flattish average loans were up a indiscernible on a linkedquarter basis harold will review that in greater detail shortly and talk about our expectations going forward but generally we continue to believe well produce loan growth primarily based on our ability to take market share due to our prolific hiring we have relationship managers with tenures less than two years thats of our rms and that represents enormous market share movement potential core deposits continued to accelerate at a rapid pace here in the quarter of course yearoveryear growth of billion includes roughly billion from our ppp borrowers but the majority of that growth is not that ppp and more likely is a function of the increased liquidity among our business clients and the lowcost deposit initiatives that we have put in place this year what i thinks been a really challenging year here we continue to have a track record for consistently growing tangible book value of nearly yearoveryear on a linkedquarter annualized basis across the bottom row you can see that asset quality held up really well in the third quarter with npas at just basis points classified assets actually down this quarter to the lowest level in the last five years and annualized net chargeoffs just basis points in the quarter im going to turn it over to harold and tim to review the results in much greater detail as we go through the details i find that there is a lot to be encouraged about regarding our net interest margin fundamentals particularly the trajectory of our cost of deposits fee income was at an alltime high this quarter weve talked for some time about indiscernible differentiated model and it has in fact proven to be extraordinarily pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 resilient producing record loan originations at an average interest rate to the borrower of record loan sales to correspondent banks with a record low in the cycle of average interest rate which makes indiscernible as the spread demonstrates both the value that borrowers place on the convenience bhg offers and the demand bhg correspondent bank network has for that paper they also had a highly rated securitization of their loans during the quarter further validating the quality of the product that theyre originating and as of october just three loans are on a deferral so asset quality is holding up very well weve said for some time that our expectation was that bhg would prove out the differentiated nature of their model during this cycle it seems to me that theyre doing that in spades so harold will review that in some detail and as you know weve talked about our transition to defense earlier this year allocating a meaningful part of our indiscernible capital to reviewing our loans book borrower by borrower that work was completed in the third quarter and so tims going to update you on that work and give you insight on what were seeing and learning but my expectation is it is likely to create optimism despite the fact that there are still unknowns relative to the timing of the vaccine desired nature of the stimulus package and the full reopening of economy so harold let me turn it over to you harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody im going to get through these next few slides quickly many of them weve shown for quite some time that third quarter results are basically consistent with what we anticipated from last time so i dont believe there are any shocking revelations as anticipated loan growth for the third quarter was essentially flat indiscernible dropped again to at quarter end which is the lowest that i can ever remember one positive note was that during the quarter new loan bookings increased consistently each month after bottoming in july were not going to declare that a trend just yet but it is a positive signal our annual loan book forecast excluding ppp remains in the low to midsingle digits and ill cover both loan yields and ppp in just a second now in deposits we had another big deposit quarter with lower rates we get more deposits we had experienced significant growth in noninterestbearing deposits ending at billion at quarter end up since year end the number of checking accounts is up almost since year end so if i could do a cartwheel id be doing one right now were estimating that the ppp program provided about billion of our deposit growth yeartodate thats a rough estimate because its basically impossible to determine a precise number that number is simply the net growth in ppp borrowers deposits between march and september last quarter we mentioned that we expected those funds to evaporate over the next few quarters my thought now is that we could be holding on to that money for an extended period of time more on deposit rates in just a second next is our usual update around loan pricing given the circumstances this is absolutely great news obviously yearoveryear loan yields are significantly impacted by yield curve adjustments particularly libor but as the tables at the bottom of the slides show our relationship managers pay a loan pricing in the third quarter we dont pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 talk about prime based credit much but weighted average loan rates have not changed a basis point in six months keep in mind the chart excludes ppp money so this is blocking and tackling kind of transactions with our client loan pools absolutely are helping if we can keep this going our ramp game plan for will get a shot in the arm im not going to spend a great deal of time discussing deposit pricing this is obviously not a new chart nobodys asking about deposit base anymore because were so close to the bottom and theres only so much more deposit money you can get we continue to target a range of less than basis points to basis points for our deposit costs by yearend our relationship managers have their client list and are working with them aimed at depositors who have outsized deposit pricing we have approximately billion in wholesale funding maturities over the next two quarters that we will likely allow to roll off without renewing thus alleviating some of the liquidity build and some of the pressure on our net interest margin bringing this information forward from last quarter the top left chart on investment securities is new weve been at an absolute level of invested securities with to of assets for a while not looking to change there were starting to get a few questions about deploying excess liquidity into bonds its really hard to get excited about any incremental leverage strategy at this point theres just a ton of uncertainty right now and indiscernible the long end of the curve will probably stay where it is for the next several years we believe carries too much interest rate risk right now there are obviously products out there that we can where we can get a few basis points for the next year or so but credit risk begins to enter the conversation weve always taken the position that credit risk is reserved for the loan portfolio so we need to reduce our wholesale funding book over the next several quarters because and this is not rocket science eventually and hopefully the ppp money is going to turn into cash so this liquidity issue is not a two to threequarter issue its likely to be a one to twoyear issue along those lines were showing that were a billion bank at september ive seen i believe we are more like about a billion to billion bank as weve got about billion in ppp money as well as a little more in excess liquidity so thats about billion to billion indiscernible investments like nim and roa that said at least the ppp program is profitable our proposed liquidity bill is not and its costing us around million to million a quarter we will share the liquidity at some point slower than wed like but that said we dont have a vaccine yet either so the additional insurance is still there out of an abundance of caution we believe that both ppp and our excess liquidity negatively impacted our third quarter nim by basis points there is a slide in the supplemental information that shows how we calculated that number now heres some good news in all that indiscernible we believe our nim after ppp and liquidity is approximately this compares to a similar calculation last quarter of i know thats only basis points of earning asset improvement but that basis points is about million in net interest income over the next months now to fee income ill be really brief fees were more than million for the quarter an alltime record everyone knows that is a powered up kind of year for mortgage its unbelievable ill talk about bhg in a few minutes but bhg as i say is killing it as anticipated wealth management rebounded based on indiscernible for investment services where fee revenues are received in a year arrears and are based on market performance pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 so now to expenses personnel costs as we stated in the press release increased due to incentive accruals as we discussed on this call last quarter our board did modify our annual cash plan such that we are providing an increased opportunity to our associates so that we can earn up to of their annual award with this modification had the board not elected to do so our incentive accrual would have been around of our associates target award we believe this will keep our associate base highly energized and motivated to ramp up the operating performance of the firm going into next year this additional incentive opportunity is based on hitting a ppnr growth rate over exclusive of ppp the liquidity bill and bhg this is our attempt to quantify the blocking and tackling of what our associates do every day without the distractions of ppp liquidity or bhg also given its ppnr the pandemics impact on our credit book is excluded so our credit officers can work with these borrowers that might have been impacted by covid in such a way that the credit officers can do what they believe is best for the bank without impacting the goals of this incremental incentive opportunity which is to motivate these people to ramp into briefly concerning cecl eventually this slide will lose its prominence and be permanently relocated to the supplemental part of the slide deck our reserve without ppp loans increased only basis points to we also increased our onbalance sheet reserves slightly and as the slide notes our unemployment forecast improved slightly this quarter so that plus flattish loan growth contributed to the modest reserve level the ppp program is back in the news not going to go through the entire slide but we indiscernible out the smaller loan balances in the top right table were unsure as to how the sba will manage the simplified approval process or the timing for reimbursement but suffice to say they carve out the smaller loans to make it easier to get repay we wont characterize the rigor of the forgiveness process as similar to the initial funding process but we are not optimistic that the larger loans will likely be a choppier process at least thats what we think for them so were expecting some net interest income left in the fourth quarter due to ppp forgiveness but expect first quarter of well see the greater lift this is a new slide and i discussed on as i discussed on the expense slide regarding incentives this serves as the foundation for what were trying to do as we ramp into with increased momentum it was a great quarter for us as ppnr per share increased above for the quarter to per share our goal is to try to ramp into with a midtohigh singledigit ppnr per share growth which we believe will compare very favorably to peers aiding our ppnr growth this year has reduced incentives so increasing our expense load for with target payout will be a big headwind for so for we are discussing how best to manage that as we close in on our targets for next year a lot to do with that is where we see the pandemic evolving over the next few months im not going to go through this slide in depth obviously we have some idea about credit cost for the fourth quarter but we continue to withhold but suffice it to say we are optimistic about our shorter term prospects and once covid is over we love our longer term prospects now briefly about tangible equity these are highquality assets that will there are highquality assets that will eventually exit our balance sheet we believe we will manage back into the high and low by yearend or in the first quarter of next year quickly some comments on capital we were hearing some banks are getting back into or initiating buyback program thats obviously on our agenda as well likely not a focus for us for the next couple of quarters we pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 intend to seek reauthorization of our buyback program soon and then evaluate whether we should restart the program we are a firm that works on many things we are focused on growing earnings per share in an outsized way but we are also intentional about growing tangible book value per share weve accomplished a lot of things since yearend our balance sheet was billion in assets at yearend one thing we are proud of is that since that time we have increased our tangible book value per share by we are second to only one other firm in our peer group during that same time period the 75th percentile of the peer group is at roughly half of our growth rate to say im pleased with how this quarter ended up is an understatement as the execution of various tactics i think it was one of the best quarters weve had its difficult to relay the significant effort that my colleagues are putting forth every day working with clients and solving their problems through this pandemic it truly is remarkable we all know its a difficult operating environment loan growth is sluggish at best and the yield curve is indiscernible of any bank plus its a yield curve that we believe well have to that we will have to live through for an extended period of time politics are also very distracting and tend to rob us of our optimism however the bright spots from pinnacle cant be overemphasized at this time depositors continue to trust us and borrowers are figuring out how to manage their businesses through this cycle discipline has never been more important we dont know how the pandemic will play out over the next few quarters but we do like our franchise and where we do business and with whom we do business we believe migration patterns are favoring more people and commercial businesses moving into tennessee the carolinas and georgia we like our competitive prospects we are as terry will discuss shortly were a force in tennessee as well as in several markets in the carolinas deposit share data would indicate that we are getting there in charlotte raleigh charleston and believe me we will score in atlanta now to bhg weve shown a similar slide before and its intended to give you a snapshot of bhgs business flows over time and more importantly how theyre holding up during the pandemic the blue bars on the chart are originations and have ramped up with more loans being funded so business flows remain strong the green bar represents loans on which gain on sale has been recorded and indiscernible sold to downstream banks this is the traditional bhg model with gain on sale revenues being generated as you can see both bars are at record levels in the third quarter coupons have fluctuated over the last four years but theres no discernible trend up or down seems like a mid14 is the tip as to buy rates they fell to below in the third quarter lowest i can recall since we became involved with bankers healthcare group one thing we have not emphasized enough is the small chart at the bottom right over banks are now in bhgs network and almost acquired bhgs loans this year that seems to be one of the strongest funding platforms for a gain on sale model on the planet there are firms out there trying to replicate this but they got to get real busy real fast to find a funding platform like bhg its taken years but it belongs to bhg they own it they developed it and they capitalize on it so from feet business flows remain incredibly healthy loan originations remain strong loan sales are at record levels and the funding platform is ready to take bhgs inventories pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 the topleft chart weve shown on several occasion the quality of bhgs borrowers has improved steadily over the last few years but particularly in they continue to refine our scorecards and increase the quality of the borrowing base the right chart again is the most powerful chart i think i can offer related to bhgs improving credit quality looking at losses by vintage losses continue to level out indiscernible since origination thus pointing toward a lower loss percentage over the life of the underlying loans pandemicrelated events will likely cause these loans to move up but the quality of the borrowing base in our opinion is very impressive as terry mentioned concerning deferrals as of june last quarter total deferrals represented about of the total book ph dennis led the group with a deferral rate bhg communicated with these borrowers frequently and worked to decrease the numbers meaningfully in the third quarter as deferrals are essentially nonexistent at the end of the third quarter of the deferred loans are current and paying of the that arent current about of those are paying to plan and paying as agreed the remaining or to of the deferral base is in earlystage delinquency so losses from these could materialize in the next two to three months with that said this has been crazy good weve updated chargeoffs and reserve builds these are for loans that bhg has sold to their network of community banks the green bar shows that currently theyve got more than billion in credit with banks who have acquired their loans the orange line shows the annual loss rate while the blue line on the chart details the recourse accrual as a percentage of outstanding loans with these other banks for the nine months of losses are running at basically consistent with the last few years lastly we said it last quarter and well say it again its been a big year for bhg and we anticipate big things for the fourth quarter during the third quarter the credit markets improved to allow bhgs opportunity to execute on their first securitization appreciate that securitization indiscernible an investment grade ratings this allows bhg to continue to diversify its revenue stream away from ph going on sale with more interest income as well as provide another very competitive priced funding source so wrapping up loan pricing is holding deposit growth is remarkable deposit pricing is headed down bhg is making an another great year and credit is very much managed so with that ill turn it over to tim to talk about credit timothy h huestis chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc thank you harold good morning everyone from a traditional credit metrics of past dues net chargeoffs npas and classified assets pinnacles loan portfolio continues to hold up well that said we understand we may not yet have experienced covids full impact on our loan portfolio before i discuss our credit slides first a few comments about our defensive credit work completed during prior quarters during the second quarter we regraded all loans greater than million that had a payment deferral we also regraded all hotel loans and all cre retail loans greater than million regardless of the deferral status during the third quarter our focus broadened to include the remaining sections of our portfolio that we did not regrade during the second quarter this extensive underwriting effort included our past cre loans with exposures greater than million the only risk grades we did not reunderwrite were our top two grades for our very best loans generally loans secured by cash or marketable securities pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 for our watch list criticized classified loans our view threshold was much lower at just our regrading exercise was a tremendous amount of work for our lenders and credit staff but we believe the benefit of quickly identifying any credits materially impacted by covid will help us in the long run during the third quarter we reviewed about loans totaling approximately billion in exposure our work during the third quarter consisted of collecting current borrower monthly financial statements conducting a survey questionnaire of our ci clients collecting data points in our cre loans the results of our third quarter credit work is encouraging at the completion of regrading work the newly identified classified loans in the quarter was only million but even more positive is that the net change in classified loans for the third quarter was a decrease of million our criticized assets had a very modest increase from the second quarter to third quarter of million a few comments about our hotel book youll recall during the second quarter we moved approximately of our hotel balances into a criticized risk grade on a very positive note since the second quarter many of our hotel borrowers have reported improving occupancy levels similar to the second quarter we conducted a four question survey of ci clients in midseptember the survey population was ph clients with total loan balances of million this time the ci survey was targeted to our lowest ph pass grade credit in a variety of segments like entertainment restaurants ph physicians three of our questions were asking the borrowers estimate of revenue for third and fourth quarter and first quarter compared to the same period in the prior year the fourth question was regarding months of liquidity on hand to cover operating expenses the results were said third quarter revenue would be between to of third quarter said fourth quarter revenue would be between and of fourth quarter said first quarter revenues will be between to of first quarter and finally reported having seven months or greater of liquidity to cover operating expenses pinnacle continues its approach of a wellbalanced and granular loan portfolio given the extent and coverage of pinnacles defensive work during the second and third quarters we believe we have identified those borrowers that have been extensively impacted by covid risk grade migration during the third quarter was modest through the efforts of our early problem identification and a very strong special assets team pinnacles classified assets decreased during the third quarter npas increased just basis points from the second quarter and net chargeoffs increased modestly from to basis points in march pinnacle began proactively reaching out to clients with loan payment deferrals we believe many of our clients accepted the offer of a payment deferral in march and april simply because the impact of covid was unknown to them the table on this page illustrates that our loans with the payment deferral have dramatically decreased from of loans as of june to just by end of third quarter by midoctober our deferrals had decreased further to just of total loans a few comments about our loan modification by september we had executed on just a handful of loan modifications totaling approximately million our loan modifications are not a one size fits all modifications are tailored to fit the circumstances of the loan and the borrower for illustration purposes ill offer a couple of examples of modification discussions with hotel clients pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 my first example we met with the borrower and agreed to an interest only period to june conditioned upon the establishment of an escrow reserve of nine months of interest payments with pinnacle we also implemented a libor floor of basis points this was a good solution for us both my second example was a longterm client with several hotel rooms that had a deferral of principal plus interest the borrower requested a longer interestonly period we replied were open to a modification provided we institute a interest rate floor the customer declined our offer due to the rate floor paid all deferred interest and agreed to resume regular pi payments our thoughtful negotiation resulted in avoiding the loan modification naturally there are many more variations in these two examples but our intent with modifications is to help the client bridge to the other side of covid but also explore ways to improve the banks position pinnacles approach to hospitality sector has always been a disciplined conservative approach of banking hotel sponsors who are wellcapitalized and have a long successful track record of operation a few attributes to indiscernible conservative hotel underwriting weighted average ltv of just weighted average debt service coverage was for stabilized properties had personal guarantees all of our hotels are open for business prior to covid we only had one nonperforming sba hotel loan of just million that we discussed last quarter during the third quarter we moved just three hotel loans into a classified risk grade the collective balance on these three newly identified hotel loans totaled just million the combined ltv for the three is just business center resort highend and airport properties are under the greatest amount of stress our exposure in these categories is limited to a few in the business centers andor airport categories this page contains data for our hotel loans approximately of our hotel loans are in the extended stay economy and limited service sectors many of these types of hotels can cover operating expense and interest expense with occupancy in the to range as illustrated by the three graphs on this page our limited service full service and extended stay borrowers have reported improving trends in occupancy since the low point recorded in april this slide provides details of our loans in the restaurant sector it groups together exposures to real estate developers who lease the restaurants as well as loans directly to restaurant operators our restaurant exposure is just of our loan book indiscernible very successful ppp program provided million in cushion to our clients loan deferrals to our restaurant clients have decreased from of the portfolio at second quarter to a modest of our largest nonowner occupied cre loan leased to restaurants none have a payment deferral our quick service segment is made up of names like taco bell sonic wendys and kfc this slide provides insight into our retail portfolio it consists of both retail store operators and commercial real estate loans leased to retail operators loans with deferrals have decreased from at second quarter to only half of pinnacle successful ppp program provided million of cushion to our clients approximately of our cre term loans are single tenant properties with tenants like tractor supply dollar general oreilly auto parts 7eleven and walgreens pinnacle bank has always maintained a very limited appetite for power retail centers we only have six power retail centers in our entire portfolio the primary tenant for these properties are names like walmart harris teeter hobby lobby and dicks sporting goods for our cre retail construction book are builttosuit single tenant to names like tractor supply dollar general and 7eleven our retail strip center construction loans had an average loan size of approximately million and had of the space preleased pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 this slide will provide some insight into the composition of our ci retail book and the owneroccupied real estate secured retail book similar to our cre retail book it is very granular this slide provides some insight into our entertainment portfolio pinnacles entertainment portfolio was approximately of total loans over of our entertainment exposure is in the music publishing space to finance the acquisition of song catalogs each catalog of songs is made up of thousands of wellseasoned diversified songs that are stable from an earning standpoint revenue from the catalog is generated primarily from music streaming fees paid from firms like spotify apple amazon and terrestrial radio pinnacles very successful ppp program provided million of cushion to our clients to summarize the present status of our loan portfolio was that of tempered optimism given pinnacles comprehensive loan review and regrading during the second and third quarter net chargeoffs continue to remain in an acceptable range our level of classified assets is stable loan deferrals have declined to just by mid october in september loan delinquencies were just basis points while we take a measure of comfort in these metrics we acknowledge that the duration of covid and no second fiscal stimulus package could alter these metrics in the coming quarters harold now back to you m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc okay tim ill take it from here as part of our q1 earnings call i talked to you about moving our firm from an offensive to a defensive posture that included things like building a huge liquidity position on our balance sheet adding billion in tier capital nearly tripling our loan loss allowance since year end and ph scarring our loan book aggressively gathered financial information from borrowers to ascertain risk and respond appropriately it also includes things like deemphasizing our continuous recruitment revenue producers never mind that the previous momentum in our recruitment pipelines resulted in bringing home revenue producers yeartodate so all that defensive work has been completed and im not telling you that theres no further need to be defensive but i am telling you that the human resources that we utilized on those defensive efforts that grew in borrowerbyborrower assessment as an example we now take that resource and use it on more offensive sorts of an issue so as we move forward number one of course is that well continue to be in active dialogue with our existing borrowers to aggressively respond to changing risk profiles number two harold has already discussed the upcoming maturities in our wholesale deposit book that will facilitate the unwinding of our excess liquidity as the pandemic subside thirdly during the course of this year we have specifically launched four broad initiatives intended to accelerate our ppnr they include one proactively and aggressively lowering the cost of our existing deposit book we intend to drive it below basis points by yearend two gathering additional lowcost deposits we have built and launched a number of deposit products with enormous potential to structurally alter our deposit mix over time these include valueadded products like indiscernible account for property managers specialized expertise in captive insurance accounts as well as expertise surrounding large nonprofits pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 number three obtaining floors on loans as you heard from harold weve made great progress in that area really obtaining floors on roughly of new renewed loans and then number four focusing on the tremendous share of wallet opportunities that we have to provide additional financial services to our existing clients that are currently purchasing from someone else we currently have meaningful traction on all four of these which should produce significant growth in ppnr or eps for some time to come and finally because all of that heavy lifting thats behind us we are now ph intent on seizing what we expect to be a once in a generation market share movement specifically ph greenwich research indicates nearly a third of midmarket businesses intend to switch not that theyre frustrated but they intend to switch they found that primarily to the responsiveness or lack of responsiveness at our larger competitors which just reinforces the power of our clientfriendly approach to deferrals and our nimbleness on ppp and so its our intent to aggressively pursue this opportunity ph guys those that you know our strategic approach as a challenger brand were purposeful about creating a work environment that excites our associates ph believing that if were successful later they will create an engaging experience for our clients and of course indiscernible result is the shareholders indiscernible so let me start with the exciting our associates just in the last months weve been recognized by american bankers the 13th best bank in america to work for and includes a lot of small and privately held banks in the category of banks greater than billion in assets we are the single best bank in america to work for according to the great place to work institute and fortune magazine we are the fourth best financial services firm in america to work for behind some giants like american express same group would have us as the fourth best place to work for women thats a powerful spot for us to be were the fourth best place for millennials in the country to work were the 12th best place for parents were winning best place to work awards in memphis chattanooga knoxville indiscernible north carolina roanoke virginia charlotte and the state of south carolina and so the chart that youre looking at here demonstrates that weve in fact been able to translate that excitement among ourselves its truly differentiating client experience these are the major tennessee and north carolina markets that ph our businesses will sail from million to million the farther to the right indiscernible experiences and the higher on the chargeoffs the more market share you have so lets start with the top left with nashville where we de novo years ago next week as you can see our client satisfaction is the farthest to the right indicating a differentiated experience and our market share is the highest indicating that experience has resulted in a number one share position were about replicating that phenomenon in every major market we serve and as you can see with one exception our client satisfaction among major competitors is the best in the market and so it seems obvious to me that were in the best position to grow share of all the major competitors in our market as further evidence that our ph the service model yields market share pickup youre looking at the recently released deposit share data from fdic for each market you have a listing of the top banks showing their market share rank their yearoveryear growth rate and how that growth rate ranks in the market so again you start at the top left with nashville were in the number one share position and were still the second fastest growing bank in that market i think a lot of people are being concerned that the large numbers we give but you can see even in a number one share position the flywheel is spinning pretty rapidly pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 as you skim across the page in knoxville we de novo out there in we climbed into the number share position and were the fastestgrowing bank in that market in chattanooga we bought capitalmark bank trust which was a de novo from the time period we bought it in weve now climbed into the number share position there and the fastestgrowing bank in that market in memphis we bought magna bank that was a de novo in year or so weve substantially moved up in the market share chart we moved up two more slots this year up to the sixth position were the fastestgrowing bank in that market looking at charlotte north carolina weve moved up three slots there into the seventh position were the second fastestgrowing bank in that market in greensboro were in the number share position raleigh were in the 13th position but were the second fastestgrowing bank in that market that is a fabulous market opportunity that were working hard to seize charleston south carolina were in the 8th position but the third fastest growing roanoke virginia were in the third market share position and the fastestgrowing bank in that market so it seems adamant to me first of all that there is a once in a generation market share opportunity coming and secondly were the ph singularly best position to be a winner which of course results in outsized earnings growth over time and perhaps further substantiation of why we expect the outsized growth is ph were going to exit this recession is our track record the bars on the left represent annualized growth from to post and indiscernible we were a smaller bank coming off a smaller base ph grew seven times the industry through the extended period is meaningful and on the right on the larger base from to post great recession we grew six times the industry and so to sum up what weve talked about here today the visibility we now have on asset quality as a result of the extensive regrading work that we have done is very encouraging eps ppnr and revenues were all exhibiting strong growth quarteroverquarter bhg is showcasing its distinctive model and highlighting what makes it different more or less comparison and lastly having completed the bulk of the defensive work that we set out to accomplish over the last two quarters we believe were uniquely positioned to pick up meaningful market share on a sound basis which we believe will result in outsized earnings growth so operator ill stop there and well be glad to take questions pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 question and answer section operator thank you mr turner the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions our first question comes from stephen scouten at piper sandler your line is now open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi steve stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co so terry you gave a lot of good color there about the market share takeaway opportunity obviously you guys had a great track record there im wondering specifically when you think that really ramps up from a talent acquisition standpoint again and is that the primary medium for which you think that will occur or do you start thinking more about ma and some of these markets as well to kind of capitalize on all that opportunity m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i think steve we have always and we continue to view ourselves to be primarily organic growers you can look at those historical charts and say we have mixed in acquisition and i think done it successfully i wouldnt be surprised if we did that but i just want to be clear we primarily think about organic growth your question is a great one the market share movement to be honest with you i wouldnt be for indiscernible and try to meet a bunch of people indiscernible run an ad campaign sales promotions all that we dont do any of that stuff its all dependent on getting relationship manager experienced relationship managers from other banks having them move those books of business to us and so that would continue to be the ph approach i think there are two things that are important about that phenomenon there number one i think i indicated early on that of our existing fas had been here for less than two years thats enormous market share taking capacity weve as i mentioned im switching terms on here but ill go back to revenue producers ph instead our relationship managers which is a broader term include mortgage originators and brokers and other sorts of revenue producers but among those revenue producers even trying to shut down or tamp down the hiring weve added revenue producers this year and so all of that hiring that has already occurred it is still in relatively early stage maturation represents enormous share taking opportunity pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 the second aspect of that idea here is we are finding much more vulnerability today in the market than we would have over the last several quarters particularly as some of these larger banks continue to struggle with regulatory issues margin integration issues and so forth and so we feel like weve got a number of folks that we had at some stage of recruitment as i mentioned we did tamp it down slow it down a lot of those folks are beginning to contact us and say they want to reconsider and so indiscernible but you get the ideas primarily about organic growth is primarily about market share movement by relationship managers and weve got a big queue of folks that are in early stage maturation already on the books and were optimistic about our ability to hire more stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co perfect very helpful and then can you maybe talk a little bit about what youre seeing on the market demand side there seems to be a view that metro areas are going to be in a bad spot for the years to come but you guys are in kind of nonmetro msas that are maybe smaller midsize metro msas where i think wed still see growth in the southeast so can you really touch on what youre seeing there and maybe especially in nashville where there really seems to be this view that nashville is just music and tourism m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah well thank you for that question i think lets talk about loan demand current loan demand i do think loan demand is near zero i mean its a little better than that but not much its pretty tight here right now but if you think about it the reason i think for that is obvious one you got a lot of people saying well right now i dont feel like taking a big risk number two i got tons of liquidity on my balance sheet youve got a bunch of ppp money i mean there are a lot of reasons why loan demand would be just a little soft and likely to be that over a few quarters which is the criticality for us as this market share takeaway thats the case for why we think we will grow but if youre asking about the view over any extended period of time for a market like nashville i think we had an analyst that actually conducted sort of a investor day if you will investor call with the chamber of commerce and i think they came away i dont want to put words in their mouth i think they came away very encouraged and excited about the potential whats in the business development pipeline as you know what drives growth in this market has been corporate relocations and what drives corporate relocations is primarily tax rate and so my belief is that phenomenon is going to continue for an extended period of time steve i know travel is no doubt limited tourism is definitely down but ill tell you this if you could make it to nashville you would still see a large number of ph cranes that scares some people but it doesnt particularly scare me because if we believe that this market is going to continue to grow at an outsized pace ill spare you the chamber of commerce speech but i promise you the tax rate and tax implications are likely to expand that benefit to markets like nashville indiscernible stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co perfect perfect and maybe one last real quick one for me on the loan loss reserve percentage im wondering obviously this is probably a nearterm event but as net chargeoffs probably flow through a little bit from the pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 pandemic and we see credit normalize over the next ph who knows three four five quarters where can we see that loan losses kind of normalize in a postcecl world is the kind of ph level we saw at is that the right way to think about it as things normalize harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah steve im not sure where that where its going to end up what were doing is trying to keep it where it is right now we dont think its a good time were trying to see it go down but eventually we think as chargeoffs materialize and i got to hand it off to tims group i got to hand it off to the centralized underwriting groups theyre digging up under all kind of the rocks trying to find out ph where the quality and the lost content this book is and so we anticipate that well see some chargeoffs materialize not that weve identified any of them yet we havent but we just think thats common and then towards the end of next year we likely will see this reserve kind of need to get some relief now unless depending on what unemployment forecast look like but were not seeing the lost content materialize in the loan book like we would have otherwise thought it was going to materialize back in march stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it perfect thanks so much for the help guys and congrats on a really good quarter m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from jennifer demba of truist securities your line is now open jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi jennifer good morning jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc congratulations on your almost 20year anniversary i cant believe it m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc we didnt know indiscernible pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc youd mentioned the market share gain opportunity terry do you think one of those opportunities would be specific to first citizens in north carolina as they are distracted with the ph crt partnership over the next two or three years thats my first question my second question is can you give us an update on what youre seeing in your atlanta de novo thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question i do think theres likely to be some opportunity in that transaction at this point im not i guess ph let me characterize it this way my excitement about that opportunity would be less than the excitement i have about the turmoil in companies like indiscernible and those sorts of companies the vulnerability there seems larger and seems more timely and those guys are saying you know this and variably when you get involved in integration work there will be an internal focus that will create some vulnerability and well certainly try to seize on it but i view those other opportunities to be still better i guess is maybe the way to characterize that i believe in the atlanta market that were doing well i dont mind indiscernible i dont have exactly the numbers in front of me but my guess is today theres about million in outstanding theres probably north of million in commitments that are out some of those are indiscernible construction kind of things and may fund up over time so its not all immediate stuff but that pipeline of commitments that exists that well have funding is pretty large and i think if rob garcia were talking to you about the rest of his pipeline in other words deals that he has in the pipe that he believes he is going to close indiscernible that momentum is building as well and of course the real measure or the real catalyst i guess might be a better word for our success is the hiring and so i think rob again would tell you that his hiring pipeline is full again indiscernible hes got about associates down there today i think about which might be classified as retail branchbased associates the others would be either financial advisors or credit analyst or something thats supporting the revenue stream there and again it looks like to me that pipeline is really ph full we will likely to have an announcement or two in the next week or two that i could be really id put in a high profile higher category so again i think were very encouraged and indiscernible rob is doing a great job i think the results are materializing jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc if i could followup one question on bhg so that performance obviously has been really terrific what who were the most stressed borrowers in the bhg subsegment they are still dentist or what are you seeing among their group of borrowers thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think the dentists are still probably the most stressed but as it sits today im not sure of any market where theyve got loans that are not permitting elective surgery so i think all the dentists are open and i think all pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 the surgeons are open the optometrists were a little stressed in the second quarter but i think by and large their business flows are coming back i can dig on that some more for you jennifer but right now im not sure that i can discern any particular segment based on the reports i get from bhg that theres one thats more stressful than other jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks very much harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i will say that nonmedical book theyre call it the engineers and the architects and those folks that they branched into over the last two to three years that book is performing better than the call it the medical book so thats been a real pleasing thing jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from jared shaw of wells fargo securities your line is now open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi guys good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi jared harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning how are you doing jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc good thanks good thanks congratulations on a strong quarter hey just following up terry you had said this is this could be a once in a generation opportunity to take market share and just given the success youve had hiring people and using atlanta as an example yeah should we really expect to think maybe you go on the offensive now and target some additional geographies obviously some of the bigger competitors you mentioned do business in more than just atlanta are there opportunities for you to expand into new geographies and really take that hiring model and accelerate it a little faster and would that turn into potentially a different expense level for in the near term while thats building out pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc jared thats a fabulous question and honestly i guess i might characterize it this way we might be tempted by that and we can be opportunistic in that regard but the truth is the play that we most want to make is to harvest opportunity in markets like charlotte north carolina raleigh north carolina i think raleigh north carolina was just highlighted as the hottest real estate market in the united states its a fabulous market whatever metric you want to look at i think you can see were in a 13th share position but were the fastestgrowing bank and so my objective is indiscernible whats happening in charlotte whats happening in raleigh whats happening in charleston in particular those three markets thats where we really want to invest thats where we want to grow indiscernible and so i dont mean to say i cant do anything else if im doing that but i do want to say that thats the most important thing for us to do to seize that opportunity that is a grand growth opportunity and again i know sometimes people are not as interested in things like the distinctive service experience but thats ph been a powerful and important point weve spent time getting that service ph wage right and its now time to harvest that in those highgrowth markets jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and that sure goes back to the of hires that have been there less than two years give a lot in those markets so you feel that they can start to really make some indiscernible m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc those indiscernible also think as i mentioned if again just trying to be candid about where the opportunity is i think the hiring opportunities are particularly strong indiscernible and to maybe a slightly lesser degree but i think picking up through this and so again those carolina markets of course are filled with wells and some form of bbt or indiscernible jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thanks and then shifting a little bit to bhg and looking at the growth that theyve had in recourse are they subject to cecl do they need to build that recourse over the same way that youre building out an allowance or is that not necessarily reflective of what their expectations for full losses are at this point in time they have maybe a little more flexibility harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah theres no doubt that this is helping them get towards a cecl number at some point cecl for them i think is a issue and theyre going down the path now of trying to analyze and quantify and build the models to get to a ceclcompliant credit loss reserve but im not sure where that number is going to actually end up jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 okay but we shouldnt necessarily look at the recourse being significantly higher than the losses at this point as a direct tie in to where they think the total loss content is today harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah jared i think if i understand your question right i think youre right we should not indiscernible yeah jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay got it and then on the issue with the success of having that securitization do you think that youll see that strategy shift back more towards beginning to emphasize securitization and maybe some on balance sheet opportunities more so than straight gain on sale or will it be a continue to be a good mix harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think theyll continue the good mix i think they believe that they will be back at the securitization game early next year so theyre ramping up to probably do another issuance call it january and february jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks a lot m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thanks jared operator thank you and our next question comes from brock vandervliet of ubs your line is now open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hello thanks just following on the questions on bhg in terms of the revenue profile youve somewhat longer term guidance about bhg in the past and as we kind of emerge from covid it seems like bhg is going very strongly the mix of securitization versus traditional placements is kind of what it is what do you what should we be thinking about in terms of the revenue or earnings profile there m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think what were looking at for next year is probably a high singledigit low doubledigit kind of number for them next year we believe theyve got the momentum to deliver that so that would be what our current thinking is brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 okay and harold i heard the guide on funding costs i guess on the opposite side where do you see securities yields trending over time and within that securities book weve seen a number of other banks really look to ramp that up whether its now or possibly waiting until after the election and hoping for a steeper curve but should we look for a really sharply higher balance there given that loan growth is a bit muted right now harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont think were going to be focused on building the loan book or executing on any kind of leverage strategy to take some of this liquidity m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc building the securities book harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc oh im sorry building the securities book thats what i meant i just said the wrong word building the securities book to execute on a leverage strategy bond yields right now look to be pretty good weve done a lot of municipal acquisitions we think a lot of that will hang with us but to say that were going to develop a strategy to kind of ramp up the bond book by or even i just dont see that brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and those yields do you have a sense of where they could drift assuming rates stick where they are harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc where they are i think our municipal book will help us hold yields but i cant help but believe that were going to see some deterioration in bond yields probably over the next several quarters but i dont think its going to be that significant brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan your line is now open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi steven pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc to start on the new incentive can you give more color on exactly what the new incentive is and is it a incentive or is it a full year in terms of results harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yes its for the whole year we implemented it and i think that our company approved it late july so what we tried to do was determine what a reasonable growth rate and ppnr would be for over and then try to figure out how to hit that number and so it gives us some consistent messaging with not only revenue producers but the whole all people and it keeps people in the game because obviously with the first quarter reserve build and then again in the second quarter of our incentive was tied to eps growth and so that effectively knocked us out of the game for any kind of cash bonus this year so we were trying to create something although not get them all the way back to the start line just trying to get us to at least to a target level to develop some plan that will help us not only this year but more importantly in steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and harold what growth rate do you need to maximize that incentive harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc what we did and well talk about it in the proxy what we did is we looked at where the peers our peers were and try to consider you know the anomalies within the peer group and said okay what does it take to get into the top quartile of that peer group steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you okay got you thats helpful and then just following up on all the commentaries around the market share gain terry i think ive asked you this before but what exactly was it that the larger banks had done with the ppp program to upset so many customers did they just turn down people for the loans they werent available can you give more color on whats created this opportunity m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah again i want to cite what i hear from greenwich and then ill give you my own personal commentary which might be indiscernible i dont know but greenwich would say that the big banks were unresponsive many of them were slow to get their systems up there was very little communication between the bank and the borrowers all that led to mass confusion as the money ran out it led to mass frustration and i think just sort of the impersonal nature of how that process worked at the big companies versus the more personalized approach pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 that smaller banks typically used where as an example for us i cant recite now how many webinars we held but we had thousands of borrowers attending our webinars many of whom werent even our customers because that became the place you go to get information about how do you apply for this how does the application work what are the issues to think through what kind of documentation do i need and so if youre not supplied that information youll create lots of apprehension among your borrowers and theyre feeling underserved and so again i think this phenomenon of the ppp process the deferral process is steve as weve talked before indiscernible the spectrum on how to handle the deferral and i promise you im not acting like either one of them is really bad or really good im just telling you what we did and why we did it and why i think it benefits us at one end of the spectrum you could say look this indiscernible you want a deferral you come down here and bring me a bunch of financial information and give me some more guarantees and put up indiscernible and so forth and i dont give you a deferral and thats not an irresponsible thing to do i mean if youre a credit person youre thinking about improving your borrowing base and trying to minimize losses and so forth that would be a tag you could take our view was to give somebody a deferral for days in the middle of the time where nobody knew what it was didnt substantially increase our credit risk and it made our borrowers love us and so that was the reason that we went in that direction and so again im just sort of rambling about two or three things that are sort of different in the approach but if you had to get it down to a word on one side its a more personalized service that puts borrowers at ease and makes them feel like youre looking after them in a less personalized kind of service that creates apprehension among borrowers which leads to frustration irritation and so forth and so thatd be my characterization of it steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay yeah thats helpful color maybe just one final one on bhg given the deferral trends i was surprised that the recourse reserve ratio increased to me it was modest but the reserves up million in the quarter the ratio was up why would that have gone higher given these really impressive deferral trends thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc all right so keep in mind theyre still a private company and theres a lot more qualitative assessments going on then with perhaps a cecl model like we have to develop or have to roll out thats more or less subjected so i think what bhg is doing is theyre just anticipating probably doing some concerns and analyzing and building a reserve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful thanks for all the color harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thats all i can give you steve operator thank you and our next question comes from catherine mealor of kbw your line is now open pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi cath good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc indiscernible follow up on your ppnr commentary and outlook so harold you talked about wanting to grow the ppnr i think well i dont know if you can mention that you wanted to have taken this midsingle digit growth rate in off of but youre at least looking to grow ppnr as we move into next year and so how should we think about that as we think about ppp rolling off and mortgage kind of normalizing do you think even with those two headwinds ppnr can still grow next year or is it more ppnr per share can grow because its an active buyback activity harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah first of all i want to make sure we understand that what i talked about during the slide was that weve excluded ppp and bhg and the liquidity build so were kind of quantifying that those numbers and excluding that from the calculation of ppnr growth so youre right how does one anticipate what ppp is going to do to our numbers this year or next year and so we didnt think it was fair to put that into an incentive target and then all of a sudden something happened with the sba they make it more onerous which we think they will and the ppp revenue is not materialized so we go through a process to eliminate that so what were trying to do is get down to blocking and tackling and thats how we come up with our anticipated ppnr growth rate now we shoot for top quartile performance its a lot more difficult to get that out of the peers so thats not exactly apples and apples when we start comparing to the peers but we would believe that the revenue contribution that were getting from ppp is greater from than a lot of our peers are going to get so thats probably a little bit of a headwind when you start talking about peer rankings for us does that make sense catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and so but your it does and so i was just thinking sure your commentary on a singledigit growth ppnr was more around the incentive plan for this year not as much on outlook for what you can do in harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc and i well that is true single to high mid to single mid to highsingledigit growth and looking at what the peers were doing next year its likely to be a similar number for next year catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 great and that includes ppp bhg and liquidity harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc that excludes ppp bhg and liquidity for us catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay that makes sense that makes sense and then also on the expense side so youve guided for expenses to be flat to down is that inclusive of the incentive comp catchup this quarter so just look at bottom line expenses and thats the number that kind of flat to down next quarter harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah the third quarter incentive had to catch us up to of the whole year so we dont have as far to go in the fourth quarter with the incentive group catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay but still youre so in what scenario are expenses flat in another million im sorry im looking at indiscernible another million harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think well i think whats going to drive it primarily is the incentive accrual because ppnr incentive is call it million and i have to get of that into the third quarter number and i only have to get of that into the fourth quarter catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay got it so really expenses should be down next quarter harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yes catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thinking that okay it was flat that was what would throw me off okay all right great and then just one last question on just do you have the updated criticized metrics i know you gave classified in the press release but do you have what criticized did linkedquarter harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc its with catherine million from last quarter i dont have that number right in front of me as a percentage pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay but up million and what drove that increase what kind of credits are you seeing from indiscernible harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc it was mostly hotels we had further count of hotels in july in july that went into a risk rate catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay great thank you very clear m terry turner a president chief executive
