david it seems like we dont have jack john p barnes chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc david sorry thank you andrew and david good afternoon we appreciate everyone joining us today and hope that you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy these are uncertain times for everyone but we are all in this together i believe we can collectively emerge from this pandemic more united and stronger than ever with that lets begin by turning to slide while the economic impact of covid19 will have a meaningful effect on the results for the remainder of our first quarter performance marked a strong start to the year and we entered the crisis in a position of strength as a communityoriented bank we have a responsibility to protect colleagues support customers and fair for communities especially in the current environment i would like to take a moment to say thank you to our employees their dedication professionalism and resilience during this unprecedented period has been remarkable despite challenging conditions they have continued to provide the level of support and service customers have come to expect from peoples united i am particularly proud of the terrific effort displayed by the employees in the completion of the core system conversion and full integration of united bank in early april the health and safety of our employees is always a top priority for the company as the seriousness of the pandemic became clear we immediately implemented a companywide prevention and social distancing policy that included a remoteenabled workforce we also adjusted branch service including reduced hours and appointmentonly banking to limit the potential spread of the virus frontline employees and those in positions where telecommuting is not possible were given additional paid timeoff for further flexibility to care for families and stay home if feeling sick themselves for additional support we enhanced benefits for all employees covered under our health plans so the cost of covid19related illness including diagnosis testing and any further related treatments are covered peoples united is committed to assisting those individuals and businesses impacted by covid19 consistent with our long history of providing support in times of need we instituted relief initiatives designed to mitigate hardships to customers caused by the pandemic such relief measures include waiving of certain fees implementing a 90day foreclosure moratorium on eligible residential loans and offering individualized support to both consumer and business loans peoples united is a relationshipbased bank and as such we believe it is critical to work with our customers to help them manage through difficult financial times we did this during the financial crisis over a decade ago and many of those customers have grown prospered and remained with us today as the result of hardships caused by the pandemic we have offered forbearance for both commercial and retail customers to once again help them navigate the challenging economic landscape as of april we have approved forbearance for approximately loans totaling billion comprised of billion in commercial million in equipment finance and million in retail peoples united is also participating in the cares act paycheck protection program we accepted nearly applications of which more than loans totaling greater than billion have been submitted to the sba and peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 approved we have currently funded billion of these loans and the feedback received from businesses weve worked with has been overwhelmingly positive finally we are also engaging community organizations and government officials to ensure a coordinated approach to covid19 relief efforts through the bank and its charitable foundations we have granted more than million in support this includes providing monetary support to response funds and nonprofits that are meeting the basic needs of vulnerable populations including lowincome residents first responders healthcare workers and small businesses moving to slide we are pleased with our first quarter performance the results benefited from both organic growth and recent acquisitions and reflected a stable margin continued strong fee income as well as solid loan and deposit growth other highlights include operating income of million increased from the first quarter last year and generated an operating return on average tangible common equity of total revenue of million was up from the prioryear quarter pretax preprovision net revenue of million increased from a year ago on an operating basis the efficiency ratio of improved basis points yearoveryear as we continued to produce positive operating leverage the provision of million increased million or compared to our quarterly run rate reflecting the application of cecl and the impact of covid19 and finally tangible book value per common share increased from a year ago even after closing two acquisitions and repurchasing million common shares peoples united has always had a longterm view predicated on conservative underwriting philosophy superior service a diversified business mix and prudent liquidity and capital management which has served us well through various operating environments sustained exceptional asset quality is a hallmark of our institution and we firmly believe it is an important lever in building longterm value as we have grown the company from billion in total assets at the end of to over billion today we have never wavered from our conservative and welldefined underwriting approach the experience of our senior credit officers is significant with an average tenure of over years this same team successfully steered peoples united through the prior financial crisis with a low level of losses as you can see on slide our average chargeoff as a percentage of average loans from through last year is only basis points well below the peer median of basis points another driver of our exceptional asset quality is our highquality cycletested customer base our local market expertise enables us to identify and develop longterm relationships with highly coveted strong business owners and operators many of our customers were with us during the prior financial crisis as evidenced by the average tenure of our top relationships being over years these longterm relationships provide us with deep knowledge of their businesses and operating performance through economic cycles the diversification of our loan portfolio is displayed on slide it is always important however during economic downturns the value of this diversification becomes even more prominent one of the strategic objectives of our risk management is running a diversified business model that does not overly expose the bank to a single line of business we have provided our exposure to sectors significantly impacted by covid19 on slide and our conservative approach to underwriting is evident our hospitality portfolio had billion in balances at the end of the quarter the majority of the portfolio is flagged by major hotel brands and most of the properties are managed and owned peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 by operators in this space as their primary business in addition the properties are primarily located in the main cities within our footprint such as boston portsmouth and burlington in addition our top clients account for over of our commercial real estate hotel exposure each of these sponsors are cycletested and have extensive hotel experience in our million restaurant portfolio nearly half of the exposure is concentrated in quick service establishments which have experienced lesser degree of disruption at the quarterend balances in our retail were billion we have no material exposure to enclosed retail malls and over half of our retail exposure is with grocery storeanchored properties pharmacies big box home improvement and gas stations and convenience stores finally its important to note that we have immaterial or no exposure to airlines cruise lines casinos energy student loans auto lending and consumer credit cards before passing the call over to david to discuss cecl and the first quarter results in more detail i want to mention that due to the uncertain economic outlook caused by covid19 we have withdrawn the fullyear goals we outlined in january as i commented earlier peoples united entered this crisis in a position of strength with exceptional asset quality strong liquidity and capital levels and a diversified business mix we are confident in our strategy of operating with a longterm view well once again show the strength of the franchise as it plays a critical role in supporting the financial health for individuals businesses and communities throughout this crisis and beyond with that heres david r david rosato senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc thank you jack we started the year with another strong quarterly financial performance as jack just referenced we entered the crisis in a position of strength our diversified loan portfolio has highquality cycle tested borrowers low ltvs and strong cash flows we certainly did not underwrite our portfolios with an assumption of a global pandemic however we are confident our conservative underwriting approach significant and cycletested risk management experience and deep customer relationships will continue to serve us well as we move through this unfolding situation with that background looking at slide and we highlight the adoption of cecl and its application in the first quarter the day one impact of the adoption of cecl was an increase in the allowance for credit losses of million or from yearend to million this increase was primarily driven by the higher reserve requirements associated with the companys longerduration retail portfolio partially offset by shorterduration commercial portfolios and our low historical loss experience the day two impact of the application of cecl further increased the allowance by million or to million which effectively was off due to covid our quantitative modeling reflects a baseline economic forecast as of late march which is indicative of a u shaped recovery in the second half of the forecast is inclusive of covid19 and the government response at that time in addition underlying the allowance is a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period as well as a oneyear straight line reversion to historical losses our allowance at march provides significant coverage as it represents more than times our annualized first quarter net chargeoffs and a of nonperforming loans furthermore the acl represents coverage of peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 our december severely adverse internal stress test which was inclusive of the recently acquired united portfolios it is important to note the current allowance reflects the view of the loan portfolios credit quality at quarterend it represents our best estimate of future losses at that time however since we finalized estimates the economic environment has continued to deteriorate and a high level of uncertainty remains as to the duration and ultimate impact of the pandemic as such we might experience another elevated provision in the second quarter moving to slide net interest income of million increased million or from the fourth quarter net interest income benefited from lower deposit and borrowing costs of million and million respectively in addition higher balances in both the securities and loan portfolios collectively added million conversely net interest income was lowered by million due to one less calendar day in the first quarter as displayed on slide net interest margin of was basis points lower than the fourth quarter the loan portfolio negatively impacted the margin by basis points driven by the downward repricing of floating rate loans and new business yields coming in lower than the total loan portfolio yield during the quarter loan spreads widened but were more than offset by lower benchmark interest rates in addition one less calendar day in the first quarter lowered the margin by basis points largely offsetting these negative effects was our continued discipline management of deposits and lower borrowing costs which favorably impacted the margin by basis points and basis points respectively turning to loans on slide average balances of billion increased by billion or from the fourth quarter primarily driven by higher average balances in commercial real estate and residential mortgage of million and million respectively on a periodend basis loans increased million or driven by a billion increase in ci balances which benefited from strong results in the mortgage warehouse and large corporate businesses while large corporate benefited from approximately million in line draws the overall ci line utilization rate was consistent with the fourth quarter at the largest offset to the ci increase was a million decline in residential mortgages as we continue to remix the balance sheet with a focus on higheryielding portfolios approximately of the loan portfolio at quarterend was either one month libor or primebased up from at yearend and billion of these floating rate loans have floors balances in the transactional portion of the new york multifamily portfolio which is in runoff mode ended the quarter at million down million from yearend id like to provide an update on the united portfolios we have chosen to runoff in january we stated we would runoff billion since then and upon further evaluation we decided to retain certain relationships associated with million of these loans after runoff during the first quarter of million the balance of these portfolios was billion at march we now expect runoff in these portfolios to be million to million for the full year moving on to slide deposit growth for the quarter was primarily driven by solid results in both our municipal and commercial businesses average deposits increased nearly billion linkedquarter benefiting from billion in higher interestbearing checking and money market balances as well as million in higher non interestbearing balances on a period end basis balances increased billion from yearend to billion we remain focused on managing pricing as evidenced by an basis point reduction in deposit cost during the quarter peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 our funding and liquidity profile remain strong with secured borrowing capacity of billion comprised of billion in federal home loan bank capacity and billion in unpledged securities we also continued to experience strong deposit inflows in the second quarter since quarterend through april deposit balances have increased a further billion looking at slide noninterest income of million marked another strong quarterly result although down from a record level in the fourth quarter as a reminder the fourth quarter included a million non operating gain net of expenses from the sale of eight central maine branches as such on an operating basis noninterest income increased million or noninterest income benefited from a million increase and a net gain on the sale of loans and million in higher insurance revenues reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals the net loan sale gain was driven by a million gain related to the sale of million of loans acquired in the united transaction and held for sale at yearend we also recorded another strong quarter of customer interest rate swap income which was up from a high level in the fourth quarter these increases were partially offset by million lower investment management fees and an aggregate decline of million in bank service charges and commercial lending fees in addition other noninterest income was unfavorably impacted by a million writedown of an msr asset previously acquired from united and by million lower income from the marktomarket of one equity security position as you will recall other noninterest income in the fourth quarter benefited from a million gain on the sale leaseback of our office building in burlington vermont on slide noninterest expense of million declined million linkedquarter the first quarter benefited from million in lower nonoperating costs which totaled million and were in the following categories million in professional and outside services in occupancy and equipment in compensation and benefits and million in other noninterest expense excluding nonoperating costs non interest expense of million was up million or this increase was primarily driven by a million increase in compensation and benefit expenses resulting from seasonally higher payroll and benefit costs and having united on the books for the full quarter versus two months in the fourth quarter we also incurred approximately million of additional expenses in response to covid19 these costs primarily resulted from more extensive cleaning of our facilities and other measures taken to protect our employees turning to slide the efficiency ratio of increased basis points from a strong fourth quarter result but improved basis points from a year ago the seasonally higher payroll and benefit costs in the first quarter were the primary reason for the modest uptick in the efficiency ratio on a linkedquarter basis as jack discussed earlier our asset quality continues to be exceptional across each of our portfolios and we entered the pandemic in a position of strength as displayed on slide nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and reo was basis points and continue to be below our peer group and top banks net charge offs to average loans of basis points was up basis points linkedquarter the increase was driven by two chargeoffs in commercial real estate which were unrelated to covid19 and had specific reserves previously established one of the chargeoffs was a nursing home that had been experiencing difficulties for an extended period and was finally closed the other was a retail strip center which lost a significant tenant both of these occurrences were oneoff events briefly on slide return on average assets of basis points were basis points on an operating basis and return on average tangible common equity of were on an operating basis were lower compared to both linked and prioryear quarters the decline in these returns was primarily driven by the provision increase resulting from the adoption of cecl peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 finally on slide capital ratios remain strong given our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management holding company capital ratios declined from year end primarily driven by the repurchase of million common shares during the quarter at a total cost of million on march we completed the common share repurchase program authorized by the companys board of directors in in light of our strong capital position and consistent with historical practices the board approved the companys 27th consecutive annual common dividend increase the ability to provide a consistent cash return of capitals to shareholders is a key part of our business model and illustrates the success in building the franchise with a long term view we understand the importance it has on the valuation of the companys shares as a result one of our most important objectives is having the capital strength to protect the dividend that concludes our prepared remarks well be happy to answer any questions you may have operator were ready for questions question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen we are ready to open the lines up for questions operator instructions our first question comes from mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler your line is now open mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good afternoon john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi mark r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hi mark mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co the first question i had was on commercial line utilization rates what those looked like today maybe versus the start of the year john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah we so very similar theyve generally been in about a kind of number theyve gone depending on the portfolio really kind of across the board on the different commercial portfolios our middlemarket business banking utilization is pretty stable same with our home equity on the consumer side so weve been watching that and were obviously wanting to monitor that and weve been very pleased with how its behaved actually i think its a sign that our customers are in good shape and not panicking and also that theyre comfortable that we will fund if they need it so its a good sign peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then secondly are buybacks likely on hold given whats going on in the environment in your current capital position john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yes mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then jack im curious does ma necessarily stop until we get sort of further along in determining how this current crisis plays out john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yes i would say definitely for everybody right mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc its just way too uncertain for everybody mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then lastly on the securities portfolio you had really strong growth there i guess im curious what was the impetus for that was it just sort of a temporary parking place for some deposit liquidity coming on the balance sheet john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc sure david do you want to take that r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah sure thanks jack well there was a little bit of a backup early in the first quarter in rates and were getting a sense that the economy could experience a bit of a slowdown we certainly didnt have a sense of what would eventually happen so we decided it was more of an asset liability move just to put some duration on the balance sheet mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 great thank you john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc thanks mark r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc thanks mark operator thank you our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is now open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi steve r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hi steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start on cecl so if we look at the day two adjustment yours was one of the most modest weve seen for earnings season can you talk about how your economic assumptions changed from day one through day two john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc go ahead dave r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc go ahead jack john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc well i could r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 yeah well i mean there was a significant change january we were living in the past life right which was somewhat business as usual and expectations for normal growth in the next couple of years low unemployment levels et cetera day two towards the end of march obviously the world had changed id go back and say that besides the change in economic environment one of the other changes was that most of the growth in the quarter was in our mortgage warehouse business which really carried a very small reserve we kind of broke that out on page so really the entire provision on day two was covidrelated not loan growthrelated steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yes but david could you share the economic assumptions underlying day two maybe just gdp r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc sure well we ran a base case scenario which was reflective of a u which is a recovery within the back half of we also ran other multiple scenarios an elongated u where recovery didnt occur until the back half of we also ran what people would call an l which is basically a multiyear recovery to where we were at the beginning of the year and then we ran a p as well and then the way our models work that those different scenarios get weighted based on judgment of management steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah okay but you did call out that you were at risk of another reserve build in just given how those assumptions had changed do you think we could see another adjustment similar to the day two around million you saw this quarter r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah i would say its entirely possible as you know almost every day the economic situation is changing this is its fluid your own bank when they announced talked about if it was being redone some of the statistics they were citing were substantially different when they went pencils down id say the same is true for us but not only are there i would say all of us getting more concerned about unemployment levels gdp for example but theres also positive things where weve got the second stimulus bill thats about the ppp program is going to start flowing next week some of the states are opening up some states are not so all its much too fluid to give any real color to what the second quarter provision will look like but so thats why our comment is we could see another large provision in the second quarter and really cant give much more color than that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then just one separate question on expenses i know you guys pulled the fullyear guidance when you look at expenses where you do have more control over that less impacted by environmental factors is there any reason the prior goal you gave last quarter of billion to billion of expenses why that would no longer be intact peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc as always steve its a good question what i would say is the fluidity of the situation is the reason that were pulling guidance and not giving more clarity as we see the year unfold we certainly expect fee income headwinds we are waiving a lot of fees at this point we had fee increases that we had planned that weve now decided to defer our wealth management business is facing headwinds just because the markets are down offsetting that will be expense reductions were thinking about the pace of technology investments will be a bit slower just because were all working remotely some of what we will wind up doing this year will be technology to support our employees remotely as well as technologies to help our customers so i think our the way we spend money going forward the balance of this year and the next will change a bit but i also think we will do our best to lower expenses as much as we can relative to fee headwinds as well as margin headwinds steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay terrific thank you for the color r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah steve just one last comment on that is so this is the quarter that at the beginning of the quarter as jack said we completed the systems conversion for united so i would like to state that we promised cost saves in that transaction and we are right on track where we should be steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay terrific thanks david john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hey steve steve i would just i dont think that the prior guidance is necessarily that we think of it as unreasonable right now based on where we are there are some moving parts that david is trying to describe to give you a sense that when we pulled total guidance maybe thats less dramatic and we are and i dont want to be misunderstood on the technologies and were moving forward on a bunch of projects that we have in place but i think davids comment is about pace and when the pace is challenged then the timing of those expenses hitting is changed so there are different things like that that we really just need to reassess and understand how were feeling about steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you thanks for the color jack john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah okay peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 operator thank you and our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo your line is now open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good afternoon john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe david just circling back on the baseline economic assumption can you just share with us what i guess what your expectations under that are for unemployment and gdp r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc sure so as i said the most important thing is the variety of scenarios that we ran so we have gdp across those scenarios from no growth in to growth down in varying by quarters unemployment rates for example in the second quarter from down to down hopefully thats helpful i mean theres those arent the only two drivers to our models as you can imagine commercial real estate prices levels of interest rates credit spreads home prices theres a multitude of metric data that goes into our model and process i would our models our cecl models are essentially have been developed from our stress testing models that weve spent sevenplus eight years i think now at this point putting together building teams getting ready to cross the billion mark to be a ccar bank so i would say theyre all loan level and they are welldeveloped and actually quite sophisticated jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks thats good color i guess one question i had you talked about the loans that you are retaining from ubnk that you thought youd get rid of what type of loans are those that youre holding on to and r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc the ones i called out million of relationships they are mostly commercial real estate loans that i would say originally we didnt understand the full extent of the relationship as we got a little deeper under the covers we do and think theres theyre high quality relationships that have growth potential for us jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just finally i guess with the broader move in bank stock prices whats the risk or the chance of a goodwill impairment charge on the books at all as we look out the rest of the year peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc its a good question there was no risk in q1 our primary driver is obviously our stock price and where we are but what i would say is its really its not something were highly concerned about because when we look at the goodwill on the books by acquisition we have nice cushions across those acquisitions and we believe we will be profitable every quarter through this and thats also a large driver jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc youre welcome operator thank you and our next question comes from dave bishop with da davidson your line is now open david jason bishop q analyst da davidson co yeah good evening gentlemen you noted the participation with the cares paycheck protection program just give us an update in terms of your fundings to date and how much youd expect to fund from the program and just curious what youre assuming in terms of fees relates to this and are they going to have a nim impact as well and just how youre thinking about actually the funding of the program john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah so this is jack as i said in the comments we got approval for billion we funded as of today something just i think a little north will end the day of billion so we funded just about we have actually through the good thinking of some of our technology folks weve put a bot into what was a manual process when we started and the pace of closing and funding the loans has picked up markedly so were actually hoping to be fully funded with the first ppp program close to by the end of the week here so we feel good about that strong effort from hundreds of people in our company and a lot of work over the weekend so we felt strongly we needed to respond for our customers and we were all in on that there will be some margin impacts the loans so and david and crew have been doing some thinking and work forecasting on that i would comment weve also put some additional automation in dealing with this phase two so were also feeling good about continuing to support our customers weve been focused on our customer base to this point in the program david jason bishop q analyst da davidson co okay peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc just a couple other issue or points of reference on that so about of the loans that weve done are at a loan origination and servicing fee about are at and about are at weve been focused on taking the apps and getting them funded and now i think us and all the banks are starting to think about exactly how the length of time these loans will be on the books and the impact to fee income and interest income the fees that were paid are actually part of the legislation range theyre part servicing and theyre part origination so if you really think about them part of that fee is supposed to be amortized over the life of the loan which technically are two years but should be forgiven in eight weeks and then part is for servicing which you can take upfront so id say us and everyone else is really getting our head around the margin impact and the fee income impact we dont really have a clear answer to that yet these will also balloon off our balance sheet if theyre on at the end of the quarter so just thinking forward i dont think our thinking would be different than anyone elses from the point of view i think well all be talking about fee income and margin with and without the ppp loans in the second quarter david jason bishop q analyst da davidson co got it from a funding perspective what are you envisioning on that funding the loans r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc well be funding the loans between probably and basis points yeah i saw something today or last night that the home loans are actually going to accept these loans as collateral thats new news so every bank can just go under their current capacities or you can use the 35basispoint facility or you can just fund it as part of your shortterm funding position david jason bishop q analyst da davidson co got it and then just in terms of some of the forbearance actions just maybe some details in terms of what youre doing in terms of the forbearance programs on the commercial loan side john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc sure on the commercial loan side its roughly of the total commercial book it varies commercial real estate and some of the equipment finance areas are most active there and it does appear to be slowing i would say definitely appears to be slowing from what were being told by the managers and the different business lines we had that david jason bishop q analyst da davidson co great thank you john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hello okay peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah we hear you jack john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah andrew s hersom a senior vice presidentinvestor relations peoples united financial inc move on to the next question please operator thank you and our next question comes from dave rochester with compass point your line is now open dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading hey good evening guys r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hi dave dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading for the loans you guys talked about on slide which is a nice breakout here i was just wondering what some of the underwriting metrics are on those ltvs debt service coverage ratios and whatnot you have that available and if you could talk about what the reserves are you have against these segments that would be great john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah so im going to ask jeff to talk some about our approach to the underwriting on the different segments and then david can maybe comment some about reserve levels jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc yeah hi this is jeff as jack and david both mentioned earlier coming into this from a position of strength and these portfolios would be similar the goingin debt yield and debt service coverage ratios and loan to values were in definitely the hospitality space and the retail space were on the conservative side debt yields in the midteens debt service coverage to times ltvs in the to range on average but as david also pointed out we didnt underwrite to a pandemic which is why having the customer base that jack described has been cycletested and in the case of hospitality having multiple hotels within their portfolio and having been at this for a long time give us comfort that well be able to kind of weather the storm but clearly if peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 you have a hotel that has occupancy doesnt matter what your goingin debt yield was youre going to have challenges and thats what were working through dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading great thats good color and then on the reserving aspect r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah and dave id really just point you back to our cecl slides the dollar reserves page but then the allowance to loans by portfolio is on page the commercial allowance of basis points inclusive of the mortgage warehouse abl at basis points retail which under cecl because of the long nature the long durations requires a higher allowance at basis points total reserves up dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading okay great and then you had mentioned a nursing home credit earlier i was just curious how large that segment was and then i know your leverage loan exposure is really low i just wanted to get a confirmation about what that number looks like john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc jeff do you want to take a shot at total nursing home exposure i had that in front of me jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc yes so yeah its not given the size of our portfolio its not significant the healthcare vertical that we manage has about million or million in it i think nursing homes are maybe a third to less than half of that the thing that weve heard most in kind of the senior housing base is on a goforward basis they expect occupancy to fall just because of a lack of people moving in and operating expenses to drift higher because theyre having to increase compensation for their employees and pay for a lot of the ppe purchases in caring for all of the people in those homes but i think here again the portfolio is with large operators who have multiple homes who do this professionally and in the line of business so its what cycletested sponsors the one nursing home that got called out as part of our chargeoffs was a very old legacy loan not part of this portfolio per se and has been troubled for quite some dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading okay john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah meaning like five or eight years it was a unique situation that the state ended up getting involved with as well and we worked through with them and finally came to closure so i would call that one very unique peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading thats great jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc yeah and with regards to your leverage lending question we dont really have a sponsor finance private equity vertical or a group so we dont do a lot of the private equity sponsor finance lending i would say our exposure in that type of businesses is modest we do have leverage loans but theyre leveraged theyre called leveraged loans because of the occ definition not because its an underlying sponsor finance type of transaction and that dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading how big is how big could that be jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc number is relatively small dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading relatively small jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc yeah i think its less than billion i believe dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading okay and maybe just one last one on capital i know you had originally talked about a target cet1 in the to range excluding the buybacks now you guys have completed the buyback its lower because of that so just wondering if you have any kind of revised target there and then tier leverage ratio specifically at now youve got the ppp loans coming on i was just wondering how low that can go what your comfort level is there itd be great r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah so obviously both ratios impacted because of the depletion of the buyback and below the original guidance we put out we just expect to build from here back to prior levels as quarters unfold so really no more color there we took them down because of the buybacks depending on the level of the provision going forward that will determine ultimately how much retention of capital we have the ppp loans as i said may or may not be on the balance sheet come just because they are forgiven theyre forgiven within eight weeks and theyre funding now just as well as a reminder that all those loans are peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 zero percent riskweighted for regulatory capital purposes so the only real effect that they will have is on tangible common at and dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading and i guess the tier leverage ratio right r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah dave rochester q analyst compass point research trading yeah all right sounds good thanks guys appreciate it r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc youre welcome dave john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from collyn gilbert with kbw your line is now open collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good afternoon everyone john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi collyn r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hi collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc david i guess just a question for you on the slide of the cecl breakout which is super helpful if we that million now where your reserve sits do you have that with that is as a percent of and you may have said this in your initial comments and i missed it but when you would go through sort of the dfast severely stress loss scenario peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah its of dfast losses under the severely adverse scenario collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay thats helpful r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah and collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc and collyn just to be clear thats not was out on our website the number thats at inclusive of united collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay got it and then just while were on that slide i know you had indicated obviously duration has an impact on the cecl formula but just can you give a little bit more color as to what drove the million reduction in the allocated reserve for ci r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc sure so under our previous incurred loss methodology we included abl and mortgage warehouse within ci and treated it as a homogeneous portfolio under cecl we have a specific model for those two asset classes so yeah thats why its approximately billion of loans that only carries a million reserve thats the basis points that you see on slide so its actually interesting if you backed those loans out as well as the million what youll see is for the commercial reserve it would go from basis points to basis points and if you did that for the whole allowance it would take our reserve from to basis points collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay got it and then just in terms of the loans that you guys have identified it kind of significantly impacted still on slide how much of those has been would you say acquired either through some of your finance acquisitions or through your bank acquisitions over the last five years or so john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 so collyn this is jack ill take a crack at that and then jeff if you have anything to add feel free we described the relationships on the hospitality side those are longterm relationships that have been with peoples united for a long time so thats of the exposure and on the retail side the description of the grocery anchored pharmacy big box all of those relationships are longterm peoples united relationships we financed for instance a lot of the stop and shop anchored properties throughout connecticut weve got couple of customers that have done a lot of cvs type pharmacy so all of that stuff is longterm tenured customers and those are all the big dollars in those pieces collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay okay thats helpful and then just lastly just on the can we just dig into the equipment finance book a little bit so the billion there maybe just walk through some of the credit metrics i know obviously restaurants are within that a little bit but just sort of how that portfolio is faring and how you see that i mean obviously the slide gives you kind of maybe day one impact of covid but if were in this longer slowdown from an economic standpoint recession how maybe that equipment finance portfolio will do john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah so youre asking about restaurants in the equipment finance collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc well just generally so just the billion just all of the equipment finance john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc oh im sorry im sorry i get you collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no its okay john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc so i would say and again ill ask jeff if he wants to add anything but so weve kind of got three distinct businesses in those portfolios the old pclc which is a leasing company weve probably operated within the company for or years those are kind of larger missioncritical pieces of equipment many of those companies have definitely been impacted by the virus and weve gotten forbearance requests but many are not many are more insulated at least now the and i would say i would think of those as kind of cash flow focused in the underwriting higher percentage arm of original loan to values thats the way that business functions competitively in the market and theyre typically fiveyear loans so you would think of kind of pretty evenly running out those periods the next one is the old fin fed and those guys do more of a smaller companies variety of cranes think about cranes on top of trucks that can move them around to different sizes some construction equipment transportation they have had an incredible record with us they know their clients really well and they have long peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 term relationships and then leaf is small ticket item wide variety of vendors that they work with in different industries and then a very tightly controlled credit box thats focused on the fair isaac small business module and then they add a lot of attributes that they work with probably the most we think one of the quickest ways we can explain the leaf history with you guys is these are its a management team thats been working together for years theyve been in the business through cycles theres a ton of public information out there about this securitizations theyve done over the years which is a big part of our underwriting and due diligence on the company so again theres going to be some companies in there that are going to be affected no doubt but i think the core going in underwriting approach is very sound and cycletested so thats the way were viewing it i dont know if jeff collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful and then oh sorry go ahead yeah jeff did you have any jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc no you described it perfectly jack i wouldnt add anything collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and i know this yeah r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc i was just going to share some historical loss numbers to place what jack said in perspective so in jacks slide where we talked about the basis points of chargeoffs through well pclc the first one jack talked about is included in that because we bound it the whole time theyve averaged over that period of time basis points of chargeoffs the old fin fed peoples united equipment finance rebound since theyve averaged basis points of charge offs because theyre so close to the collateral and then leaf who we havent owned since but they have public securitizations out over that time period so from through last year their average annual chargeoffs were basis points collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great color all right thanks guys i will leave it there appreciate it john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from matthew breese with stephens inc your line is now open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good evening everybody peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi matt r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hi matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i just wanted to follow that last line of questioning there so could you remind us of what the size of the overall leaf portfolio is i just want to frame a reference for page where we see a lot of equipment finance loans with forbearance but not a very large amount of outstanding i would assume thats a lot of leaf related loans r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah leaf is current portfolio is billion matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then do you have prior to for leaf what they did through the great financial crisis in terms of chargeoffs and the same question for fif r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc well so fin fed rebounded since so no i dont have their data prior to for leaf some of that information is publicly available because they had public securitizations outstanding we dont usually reference that because the business model coming right out of the crisis was different than what it was since so its not really applicable when we went through some of that early on their chargeoff history averaged about to basis points matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and could you remind john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hey matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc yes john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 matt this is jack i just want to make sure you dont as i

stephens inc okay understood last question for me you mentioned assets under discretionary management obviously postquarter that could change do you have what that number is down to as of april versus
