qualities through improved client engagement driving product performance supporting the overall financial system and safeguarding our workforce are all key priorities for us we demonstrated success in each of these areas this quarter and delivered strong results for our shareholders as a result our clients are at the center of everything we do youll recall that in we took a number of actions to improve client service quality engagement and decisionmaking these measures have led to improved client state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 engagement which is critically important in the current environment and its impact is evident in our results and business performance our clients are continuing to turn to state street for operational capabilities and solutions during the second quarter we effectively managed to onboard a number of new client projects across various client segments including a large asset manager a significant asset owner and a national wealth manager in crd indeed we see true sustainable momentum developing our alpha crd platform all this occurred while processing and increases in back and middle office transactions respectively we were the first service provider to support the launch of the semitransparent etf products and we see strong demand in the market for this innovative solution our service quality is being recognized across the industry for example we are particularly proud of our ranking in the euromoney fx survey where state street was named the number one fx provider to asset managers for the third consecutive year with the number one ranking in overall customer satisfaction globally the strong client engagement is reflected in our product performance our investment servicing assets under custody administration which increased quarteroverquarter to trillion had another healthy level of new wins amounting to billion in the second quarter assets yet to be installed stood at a strong trillion at quarter end at global advisors assets under management totaled trillion and we recorded billion of total net inflows during the second quarter our spdr range of etfs recorded its best quarter of inflows since the fourth quarter of while spdr gld the gold etf had its strongest ever level of inflows at billion further we are competing and winning in key strategic areas of focus for us our recently expanded and re benchmarked range of low cost etfs also recorded its highest quarterly level of inflows at an billion our sector spdrs made strong market share gains with almost half of ph sec industry flows going into the product during the second quarter and we remain at flighttoquality for cash management and liquidity solutions across a suite of product options we continue to play a critical role in supporting the financial system the operating environment remains uncertain as the pandemic continues to impact many parts of the world while we have seen a partial recovery in some areas many economic indicators continue to point negatively and unemployment remains high reflecting the real human cost of this health crisis state street continues to support the broader economy and markets and is actively assisting client access to various federal reserve programs that support the flow of liquidity and credit currently state street is involved in five federal reserve programs either directly such as with the money market mutual fund liquidity facility or as a programs custodian and administrative such as the main street lending facility lastly developing high performing organization and planning ahead for our global workforce also continues to be a priority we continue to have about of our employees working from home as we optimize workfromhome model while leveraging technology to enable better collaboration and more effective ways to serve our clients last quarter we took measures to protect our employees and announced that through the end of the year we suspended any workforce reductions other than for performance or conduct reasons in light of the covid19 crisis now we are going further for our employees by increasing their opportunities for mobility by launching an internal talent marketplace by supporting our employees as they take on new roles and learn new skills the marketplace will better develop and redeploy our internal talent to meet our evolving business needs and the growing demands of clients and stakeholders state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 turning to slide and our second quarter and first half performance highlights i am pleased by our continued strong performance and the progress we are making toward achieving our medium term financial goals relative to the prior year period total revenue increased and fee revenue increased second quarter eps was up yearoveryear and roe was i am pleased to report that our second quarter pretax margin improved by over percentage points yearoveryear to our first half pretax margin increased by percentage points the fronttoback alpha platform strategy provides an attractive value proposition for our clients our second quarter performance was helped by the strong revenue performance of charles river development where we had key business wins and renewals the alpha crd pipeline continues to develop well with a good mix of deal sizes functionalities and scope we expect to be announcing new major wins between now and yearend turning to expenses the pandemic created an immediate challenge to our expense reduction planning relative to our original expectations at the start of the year to help offset this impact we took immediate action by implementing a hiring freeze launching the talent marketplace i just referenced and reassessing all discretionary expenses im pleased to report that through our continued expense management efforts further it optimization and operational productivity measures we reduced total expenses by in the second quarter relative to the year ago period while we continue to invest in our business first half expenses are now down net of those investments relative to the year ago period for us productivity management is a way of life as we continue to build on the strong culture of expense management we successfully established during when we undertook significant actions to improve our operational efficiency and reduced expenses through a comprehensive firmwide expense savings program we cannot control the economic environment but we can control our expenses despite the challenges that covid pandemic has created we remain highly focused on driving productivity improvements and automation benefits as we strengthen our operating model and enhance service quality even during this challenging period turning to our balance sheet and capital we are pleased with our ccar results and the inaugural determination of our preliminary stress capital buffer at the minimum level the covid19 pandemic has provided an unprecedented realtime stress test and our strong capital position has enabled us to operate effectively help stabilize the financial markets and support our clients employees and communities while the environment remains uncertain state streets performance under the federal reserve severely adverse scenario is another reminder of our business models resiliency and our capital stability we recently announced our intention to continue our quarterly common stock dividend of per share in the third quarter consistent with the federal reserve instructions to all large banks we will be suspending share repurchases for the third quarter as we look ahead given our strong capital position we will consider a full range of capital actions including the resumption of share repurchases in upcoming quarters we will of course take into account economic conditions safety and soundness the federal reserve supplemental ccar scenarios and review process our capital levels and any interim regulatory limitations to conclude im very pleased with this quarters results which demonstrates continuing revenue improvement even during difficult times as well as further evidence of our ongoing ability to tightly control expenses while continuing to safeguard our employees and serve our clients and with that let me turn it over to eric to take you through the quarter in more detail state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 eric w aboaf chief financial officer state street corp thank you ron and good morning everyone let me begin my review of the second quarter by summarizing our yearoveryear results on the left panel of slide eps is up revenue is up expense is down with expanding margins and healthy roes and i think it is useful to point out that while we continue to operate in an extraordinary environment with the covid pandemic our results this quarter show strong underlying momentum and durability in our state street operating model our bellwether servicing fees are up yearonyear our prior investments in our global fx and crd franchises have yielded strong results weve been able to carry reserve build and throughout all of this we have continued to drive expenses lower and lower and so our pretax margin is up points yearonyear and our roe is up points turning to slide period end auca levels increased yearonyear and quarteronquarter the yearon year move was driven by higher period end market levels and client flows partially offset by previously announced client transition that had a de minimis effect on revenue during the quarter quarteronquarter the auca increase which is partially reported on a lag was mainly due to higher period end equity market levels aum levels increased yearonyear and quarteronquarter to trillion driven largely by higher period end market levels and net inflows amidst continuing uncertain economic conditions global advisors saw net inflows of billion driven by cash and etf flows partially offset by institutional outflows i highlight that our us spdr etf saw another strong quarter with billion of inflows which was well diversified once again as ron mentioned our low cost spdr portfolio etf saw their largest quarterly inflow yet and continue to gain share our commodity etf and sector etf saw strong inflows too moving to slide servicing fees were up yearonyear reflecting higher client activity and net new business only partially offset by some pricing headwinds which continue to moderate servicing fees were down quarteronquarter driven by lower average market levels partially offset by higher client activity despite the recovery in equity markets since the first quarter average domestic and international equity markets were still down sequentially impacting servicing fees however client activity remained elevated though down from march levels as market volatility persisted throughout the quarter amidst the ongoing pandemic we have maintained business continuity and continue to provide clients with the benefits of our scale and diverse capabilities on the bottom right of the panel of this page weve included again some sales performance indicators that underline this dynamic as you can see auca wins totaled billion in q2 with several deals coming through assets to be installed as of period end were strong at trillion we continue to have a strong pipeline of front to back alpha deals and expect multiple alpha announcements in the second half of the year turning to slide let me discuss the other important revenue lines beginning with management fees q2 revenues decreased yearoveryear driven by institutional product outflows and mix partially offset by strong net inflows from both etf and cash products with the second quarter now complete and have better sense of the fuller great picture we now anticipate that the likely impact of money market fee waivers net of distribution expense will be at the low end of our previously announced range or just million to million for the fullyear state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 as i mentioned in earlier my remarks fx trading services saw another strong quarter with revenues up year onyear but down quarteronquarter as the business again elevated volumes and increased client demand but down from the record level seen in q1 the fx rating franchises continue to see market share gains and increased client engagement as ron mentioned we saw strong results across the recently released euromoney survey securing the number one spot in global customer satisfaction in service as well as the number one spot for all products and for electronic trading for higher asset manager clients securities finance revenue decreased yearonyear as agency lending demand for assets widens and shift towards lower spread fixed income assets and as ongoing hedge fund deleveraging in falling markets drove down and hence cut the demand securities finance revenue was flat quarteronquarter finally software and processing fees increased yearonyear and more than doubled quarteronquarter driven by significant revenue adds of crd which ill talk more about shortly and past positive outcomes in our market sensitive activity which include certain currency translation impacts and marks on employee longterm internal plans these other items were positive this quarter in contrast to first quarter when they were notably negative moving to slide crd generated standalone revenue of million which was up yearonyear and quarteronquarter driven by a large wealth implementation and several large asset manager renewals weve always talked about the lumpiness inherent in asc revenue recognition standards so while we are extremely pleased with these results remind you not to read across any one quarter moving to the righthand side of the page we were quite pleased to see the momentum in crd this quarter overall and the progress we have made to expand the crd presence in the wealth segment in particular which you may recall was one of our key synergy commitments at the time of acquisition wealth now represents approximately of crd revenue and represents another area of growth for us turning to slide nii decreased yearonyear and quarteronquarter excluding the impact indiscernible market benefits of million in first quarter nii was down quarteronquarter the sequential decline in nii was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of lower market rate including the impact of central bank intervention with more usd liquidity driving lower than expected sponsor repo volumes we continue to support clients use of the federal reserve money market mutual fund liquidity facility as a result this quarter mmlf balances averaged billion and finished the quarter at billion you will see on the lefthand side of the slide that this quarter we are also showing our nim excluding the impact of the mmlf while mmlf had a positive impact on nii this quarter its impact on our nim was a negative basis points average assets increased quarteronquarter and average deposits increased quarteronquarter however period end deposits decreased or billion quarteronquarter as a portion of the uptick in the deposits we saw at the height of the pandemic receded in the last few months given the feds expansion of the money supply however we do expect a good portion of the current deposits to stay with us which we will reinvest in a mix of both loans and securities state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 moving to slide weve again included some color on the loan portfolio as well as the companys allowance for credit losses on the top panels of this page you can see updated detail around our high quality loan book and its characteristics compared to first quarter average loans decreased while period end loans decreased primarily driven by a reduction in client overdraft levels we saw during march overall the loan book remains healthy with our largest lending category capital cost enhancing to private equity funds seeing no change in borrowing pattern but with continued strong demand for new facilities moving to the bottom panel the allowance for credit losses increased to million primarily due to million in provisions for credit losses driven by changing economic conditions and ratings migrations offset by million in net chargeoffs you will note we took advantage of the rally in the leveraged loan markets to selectively de risk our leveraged loan portfolio and exited certain positions which effectively cost us million given the necessary reserve build so a good trade on slide we have again provided a view of expenses this quarter exnotables so that the underlying trends are readily visible our expenses were down yearonyear and down quarteronquarter excluding both notable items and seasonal expenses with favorable trends across most expense categories as we said last quarter amidst the ongoing pandemic we continue to execute on many of the investments and optimization savings initiatives detailed earlier in the year and while we suspended workforce reductions through yearend other than for performance or conduct reasons in light of the covid crisis we have found additional expense opportunities to act upon we continue to make progress on lowering compensation benefits costs occupancy costs and other costs while it costs are lumpy but on track we are particularly pleased that our results reflected continued and sustainable expense reduction notwithstanding the extraordinary market conditions while also delivering topline revenue growth moving to slide on the right you can see the evolution of cet1 and tier leverage ratios we are thus navigating this challenging environment with strong capital levels in our standardized cet1 ratio increased percentage points quarteronquarter to driven by solid retained earnings and a reduction in rwas as market volatility receded the tier leverage ratio was essentially flat at due to higher capital levels offset by higher deposits we were also pleased with our ccar results our capital resilience under the fed stress scenarios continues to demonstrate our low risk profile and this year we received a preliminary stress capital buffer requirement of which would have been much lower if it were not floored at as you know the fed has asked for large banks to suspend share buybacks in the third quarter however we expect to continue to pay a quarterly dividend of per share and finally as ron noted the firms capital position remains strong amid the uncertainty created in the covid19 pandemic accordingly well consider a full range of capital actions including the resumption of share repurchases in upcoming quarters but will do so considering economic conditions safety and soundness the supplemental ccar scenarios and review process our capital level and any interim regulatory limitations state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 turning to slide we have again provided a summary of our results as we mentioned earlier we are pleased with the results and believe they are a reflection of the durability and resiliency of state streets business model as well as our focus on delivering on our strategy of both growth and productivity throughout this crisis we have differentiated ourselves by proactively reaching out and assisting clients through these difficult times we believe that our resiliency during this extraordinary period and our constant attention to service quality has created goodwill with our clients and positioned us for share gains over the medium to long term last quarter i outlined our fullyear financial outlook under a certain set of assumptions noting that there was a range of possibilities as a result of the potential length of the covid pandemic and the associated economic impact i would like to update those expectations with our current thinking again noting there remain a broad range of possible outcomes we now expect global central banks will keep short rates at currents levels for the remainder of the year and long end rates will stay at a june spot rate through yearend we also now assume that average global equity market levels for the remainder of will be flat to current levels as a result of our clients engagement moderating pricing pressure and crd and also our fronttoback wins we now expect that fullyear fee revenue will no longer be down to yearonyear for the full year but instead will be up approximately to with servicing fees expected to show a yearoveryear improvement relative to regarding nii given the impact of continued lower long end rates on the investment portfolio and central bank intervention with more usd liquidity driving down the expected repo volumes we now expect nii to be down approximately to on a sequential quarter basis and expect the fourth quarter to be relatively in line with the coming third quarter turning to expenses we remain laserfocused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and achieving automation benefit we expect that fullyear expenses will now be down at the better end of our previous guide of down to yearonyear excluding notable items as we continue to find ways to control and drive down expenses in regards to our provision for credit losses we continue to see a range of outcomes based on evolving economic conditions and any ratings migrations on taxes we expect our tax rate for the full year to be closer to the lower end of our to range and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer state street corp thank you eric operator can you open the call to questions state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of brian bedell from deutsche bank your line is open brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning folks thanks for taking my questions eric if you could just unpack a little bit the nii guide just in terms of what you are seeing for client deposit levels moving into and to what extent your guidance for and includes more reinvestment or more shift of deposits into longer term securities im sorry and i also want one more on that if the retail financing business in terms of the impact it looks like that was much lighter in the second quarter through just your thoughts on that for second half as well ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp eric you are muted eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp brian its eric thanks for the question were clearly navigating through some challenging time for the with the interest rate environment and obviously trying to do our best to navigate through when you think about nii guide there is clearly the continued downtick in longterm rates which is affecting the investment portfolio and will continue to some extent in the coming quarters after that and then there is some lower volume sequentially and overdraft and then the mmlf balances that are also contributing to that to the second quarter to third quarter decline i think once we get to that level part of what happens is that youve got offsetting factors youve got on one hand the lower long end rates which put which tends to track through the investment portfolio for another couple of quarters which creates a downdraft and those i think can be offset by the growth in the investment portfolio and lending base which is really supported by the higher levels of deposits that were operating at now its hard to tell exactly what the deposit levels are going to be but i think if you stare at the data that weve shown here we used to run at billion to billion of deposits first quarter average was solidly at billion second quarter was solidly at billion we think we are going to land somewhere between those two points which means that off of the original base of call it billion of deposits there is an ability to expand the investment portfolio put on duration carefully and selectively invest in some highquality position to maintain our hqla and we think that together should create some stability on nii in the coming quarters the sponsored repo program as you mentioned did create a downdraft from to and what were seeing there is that the overnight repo rates are less attractive than theyve been relative to one month treasury rates and so that creates reduction in volumes if that were to persist then were not going to get a lift there and were not going to get the volumes wed like to see on the other hand if that normalizes back there could be some upside in the coming quarters but more more time will tell before we can incorporate that into our forecast state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thats super helpful and then maybe on crd the was a very strong quarter very encouraging on the wealth management wins maybe just a twopart question eric on the revenue trajectory obviously its lumpy like you said maybe if you can just try to characterize what you thought was onetime licensing fee revenue within the second quarter and then maybe ron if you want to talk a little bit about that wealth strategy sounds very encouraging in terms of the win that youve announced and potential new wins down the road and maybe just in terms of sizing that space for you what youre doing there on the wealth side thats different than the institutional asset manager side at crd ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah brian why dont i start and then ill turn it over to eric so ill start on the latter part of your question there as we mentioned when we acquired charles river that in addition to its core institutional client segment it has developed a fair amount of technology applicable to the wealth segment particularly the larger wealth manager segment large private wealth managers wirehouses et cetera and that is weve continued that rd and also leveraged our own client relationships to be able to help propel that growth and thats what you are seeing playing through we see it as a solid and additional form of growth on top of the core institutional business right now i think its about of the business up significantly from when we acquired it and we would expect it to be growing probably a little bit more than the at a slightly higher level than the institutional business and the good news about this is that it shares the same technology and operating platform i mean there are certain sub applications that are different but we can do this at scale easily and the way i would say you should think about the lumpiness i mean eric will take you through the how the accounting actually works but when you start to see kind of a positive lumpiness like this i mean its essentially a client being installed and its at the point then that we can start to recognize revenue and following that would be ongoing recurring fee so thats how you should interpret the lumpiness it is onetime as it relates to that client but its certainly not onetime as we continue to grow youll see that same kind of lumpiness eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp brian let me add some texture and even some numbers to that so that you can get a better sense of the underlying revenues here and were quite pleased with the growth trajectory were quite pleased with the pipeline with the kind of contracted but not yet installed level we track the number of different metrics here to give us confidence in the developing growth the revenues really come ill call it broadly into two buckets there is saas revenues and professional services and saas revenues are pretty straightforward you win a client its a fiveyear contract and the revenue recognition is that the revenue is ratably applied over those five years very straightforward and in fact we want to be in the business of growing saas revenues over time and professional services because those create a very regular and recurring set of revenues the second part of the revenues come from onpremise installations and we have a number of clients who had onpremise installations and even some who continue to prefer them and in those cases the revenue recognition comes in two parts you have an upfront piece which could be in the range of around of the contract and then you have the balance call it in the example ive given you which could be ratably over the contract length if that were say a four or fiveyear contract and so you get a piece and then you get a trail behind that so those are the two big pieces state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 when we look at the revenue number that we showed you on page you go back what we want to be doing we want to be growing both pieces to be honest and in particular the regular the first one the very recurring revenue base if you go back on page and you look at the data we shown around revenues back in the second quarter of we had million of revenues about of that was in saas and professional fees and so it gives you a sense for the kind of the relative amount if you go indiscernible quarter of this year those recurring saas and professional fee revenues were just over million but we see nice growth yearon year and in fact its happened consistently over the five quarters and then the balance of the million is been more in the onpremise kind of revenue installations where you get a goodsized piece upfront but then the recurring piece in the future and i think if you step back with that kind of revenue recognition where we are focused on growing client and client engagement and some clients are delighted to be on the saas platform and weve seen consistent growth there so that gives us some confidence in the kind of the completely recurring base and then you have the more onprem kind of revenues which start off with a piece they then have a trail all right and then when the contract ends you get another piece thats lumpy and then a trail after that and thats just the nature of the beast of how the revenue recognition works allin we are quite pleased with this revenue trajectory the backlog the contracted but not yet installed and the sales performance and so while you see some lumpiness we are seeing good underlying metrics as well brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats great color and a lot of detail thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to understand a little bit on the expense side i know you called out improvement there in part from things like market data which is really impressive given that market data cost for most participants is moving higher and higher every quarter so just wanted to get a little bit of color on that and on the subcustody savings and to what degree is there more legs there in that specific line item in your expenses eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp betsy its eric both of those are sizable expense categories they both are part of the transaction processing line item that we report and what we found is that we need to just actively manage those subcustody is something that we need provided to us and so weve worked with some of the largest banks as well as some of the country banks to find the best mix of service at a declining cost level and our view is that thats something we need to keep doing year after year and weve been able to deliver i think some good savings this year and our expectation is to continue that trajectory state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 market data is a little more complicated to your point is that there is a plethora of market data ingestion thats possible and what weve found is that we need to both manage the ingestion pipes because if we secure market data in too many different pipes then we end up buying more than we need we also need to find vendors and over the last couple quarters weve started to really work more closely with several of our vendors around who gives us the best cost and pricing kind of quality levels and thats also been factored in and then theres a third piece to be honest on market data which i find helpful from a client standpoint to be honest which is some of our market data costs are borne by us which we want to drive down but with the right quality and others are market data costs are sometimes borne with our buyer clients and were in many cases working with our vendors again both pools of market data to try to secure the best results for them as well so lots of activity there what i would tell you is that some of what you see on that transaction processing line is the result of some intense focus on those areas and its actually a bit of an example of what were doing in other areas we talked about starting to drive our technology cost down and so were doing similar work on hardware costs and hardware vendors working with them in a more active way we are doing that in software and maintenance contracts on the technology side and so its really become an expanding ill call it expertise but sort of partnerships and approaches that weve taken i think to good effect but to be honest one that we need to repeat year after year to get the benefits that we like to help drive our expanding margins betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and so youve got some more legs there is the nut of that answer and i appreciate all the color its interesting especially with the client side of it the follow up i have for you eric is regarding the net interest income net interest margin outlook and i know you have a to down q2 and and then stabilization into maybe you could give us some color on the assumptions around the stabilization what has to happen for that to come through eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp yeah the stabilization is really driven by i think the economic kind of the interest rate environment first and foremost so were assuming shortend rates stay more or less where they are and were assuming longend rates stay more or less where they are ph the forward though weve had some expansion and increase and i think weve gone a little gunshy about always planning for those and so we feel like we should plan at the current levels so thats the first part of the assumption base i think the second part of the assumption base is that there is some normalization in deposits but as ive said i think weve got a nice chunk there that we can begin to think of as or that we are confident are stickier and it depends on the speed of our reinvestment in the investment portfolio into some asset classes that were comfortable with and i think that will factor in as well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thanks operator your next question comes from the line of glenn schorr from evercore isi your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 hi thanks quick followup question on the expense side i heard your overall comments so thats what matters most but within this quarters dropdown of the reduction expenses was lower marketing and travel im assuming thats the product of the environment so how much of that is sustainable or works its way back in again i appreciate thats probably part of your overall expense comment ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yes glenn thats fair because as you know were trying to find sustainable expense reductions this year and then into next year and if we just firmed down and they pop back up it doesnt count neither for our shareholders nor for us there are some tailwinds of travel expenses and even some medical benefit claims are lighter in the expense trends but remember there is also some headwinds that we would have or actions and areas where we would have driven expenses down that we werent able to and so as the biggest simple example is the pause on layoffs because of the pandemic now that would have been worth at least half a point of expense reduction if not a little more for every quarter this year and on a full year basis and i think what were going to have to do next year is go back to what weve been doing driving down all of our costs our compensation and benefit cost where well be able to now action that and continue to drive down thirdparty spend cost as well and so i think the trend will line up there is just going to be some ins and outs or headwinds and tailwinds at any point but we see a path to continue doing what we are doing which is to drive expenses lower and lower year after year glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay i appreciate that and then during the quarter you announced a venture with fnz on servicing and the wealth management space im curious if you could talk a little bit about what the target of that venture is they seem to have a really strong operation in europe but you bring to the table what they bring to the table thatll be great thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah glenn its ron so fnz has a very strong operating platform its target market is a certainly in the us would be the smaller andor a lower end in terms of size of market segment than we do in charles river and crd so its quite complementary to what we do we would be their custodian and administrator as they move into that space so we view it as a way to expand into a even further into wealth as a segment that we wouldnt naturally have leading capabilities in number one number two they have got some really interesting technology that we want to continue to figure out we can use elsewhere so its a way of getting some technology leadership as well as a revenue stream at a relatively low cost for us glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken from ubs your line is open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 good morning thanks for taking my questions first id like to follow up on the charles river commentary and the frontend fees versus that trail and the trail dynamic it sounds like thats a little less than half of this quarters revenue so wanted to confirm thats the case and then is the onboarding the installed frontend is that a multiple quarter dynamic or is that a single dynamic how does the trailer in those arrangements compare to the upfront so how should we think about the continuing revenue dynamic and then how long are those contracts and whats the typical retention rate i just would love to get a better dimension for the cadence of those revenues if you can provide some of that thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp brennan its eric its fair to get into the detail because the details do matter but as we do that let me remind you there is a range of details and so let me try to answer the question that we can certainly follow up with you and other investors that are curious but this is a bit of the bankers working in a software space which just operates in a different cadence with asc first the recurring revenues the saas kind of implementations are pretty straightforward and i think i gave the numbers there and i think youve got the right mix the mix in each of these quarters though has been much more kind of saas professional services the completely ill call it completely stable revenues and those have been building nicely and i think we are quite pleased with that trajectory on the lumpier part of the revenue which is the onpremise installations the answer is there is a range of different situations which have to do with different contract lengths and so let me just give you a sense contract lengths can range from call it three years to eight years right and for those kinds of ranges then you tend to get on threeyear contracts you might get upfront and then the other over the rest of the three years and it comes in kind of year by year by year or quarter by quarter by quarter the effect or for something like a seven or eightyear contract youll tend to get about in the first year and then the other in the seven or eight years ratably and so there is a range but i think its i dont know its the account slated to measure the revenues in a reasonable way and youll have to talk with them if you like it or not i cant really opine there but thats the range the upfront piece comes in a particular quarter and why is that because thats when the system literally goes live and is beginning to serve clients so it becomes inserviced and its the quarters after that through the length of the contract that you ratably see the rest of the revenues what i do want to remind folks though us that once we have a client the client retentions in our business are very very high we retain most of our clients and so on a threeyear contract the description that i just gave of plus a over the trail three years later gets repeated right same for a fiveyear contract five years out and so in a way were a little hesitant when people casually say well thats onetime its not really onetime right its there is a good piece upfront there is good piece ratably that weve secured and then there is almost always the extension which brings us the same thing again its just that its a little lumpier than wed all like so maybe ill pause there but happy to talk more at the right time brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc well one more piece of my question i think that you might have forgotten eric is the retention rate whats the historical retention rate on those threeyear indiscernible state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp i mean we can i think its very high why dont we do a little follow up and get that out to you in a reg fd brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp but its they were part of our diligence of retention rates before i put a precise number let me come back but its very very high ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yes eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp its something that gives us a lot of confidence because remember once you have an onpremise installation like youve invested a lot internally on the client side to integrate it with your estate with your other systems and subsystems and so there is a willingness and there is an ability which together result in very strong very high renewal rates ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah brennan its ron maybe just to reinforce why that is i mean typically what goes on in these conversions is there is a pretty big and significant operating model change that goes on at the asset manager or the wealth manager so typically a new client is not that were displacing somebody like aladdin typically its a client thats got a bunch of bespoke and scattered technology and they are moving to a comprehensive kind of system like this so thats why you get very very high retention rates because frankly the switching costs on the client side are pretty high brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah thank you for that i appreciate all that color ron and eric and then following up on you gave some great color on expenses and i understand its really hard to be too granular eric to your point in the unusual operating environment that were in but ph id give something in a shot anyway have you reviewed your real estate footprint boston is a fairly expensive city and when you look at your website it seems like you have three different offices in the city its not really the optimal footprint based upon the experience that we have been seeing here early read on the pandemic and the shutdown have you rethought the potential for remote or distributed workplace arrangements how much do you think you can compress your occupancy expense over the next few years on the back of some of that state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp brennan its eric let me start on that to give you a little bit of kind of nearend views and ron may play in as well and in fact i might ask your cfo the same question when i see him next because i think every cfo out there not just bank cfos is wrestling with this question you know here at state street we have occupancy expense of about million bucks and we had already planned to drive it down this year by about so taking a chunk out of that and part of that is continued rationalization of our high cost location footprint and taking advantage at the same time of some of the productivity right take that from the head count management that we have done around the world as well i think in the very near term a couple of things happened in real estate one is we just dont add any real estate and ron and i put an immediate halt as soon as this pandemic happened and let me tell you there is no that halt is perpetual practically it then it does have a little bit of an effect where we cant easily sublet so now what we are doing is going back to every lease that we have and literally going through and asking the question when does it roll over the question that it really wrestles through is what kind of occupancy rate can you operate at and if you know most of us have operated at the call it to occupancy rate and i think what this pandemic has demonstrated is that the tools and the capabilities through technology and the methods that we have in our company is we can drive occupancy rates up to we are originally planning to just by thinking about peoples historic approaches to being in the office are not and i think that is kind of what gives us the view that if we originally thought we could get to a occupancy rate and now with the pandemic we are confident we could get to thats how you start to get some real leverage on the occupancy cost i think the one thing that gets in the way of that and im taking a very kind of financial and we have to think about our people our teams our clients and all the interactions and all that they do is we also need to be respectful of some of the social distancing requirements in the immediate term and so i think what we have is we have a period right now where workfromhome is lets say with social distancing we can bring a certain number in at some point there is a vaccine so the social distancing may not be at the same level as it is now and we have a whole group of employees who have learned to operate incredibly effectively workfromhome some of whom prefer to be home and so i think theres a lot to do here this is i guess the summary i tell you we are already down occupancy cost and i think the question that well come back to in the coming quarters and in the coming year is how much more it is not that they cant that they wont come down they will come down i think its a question of scale off of that base of expense that i circled it from ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah brennan its rob what i would add to that is in a fairly short period of time we have gone through three kind of phases of work workfromhome was about a oneweek event for us and we got of the people out of the buildings and into a home environment we started about three weeks after that planning the return to office which in asiapacific as you can imagine work started back also parts of europe slower in us for all the reasons that we know we have also launched the third phase of this which is what were calling the workplace of the future which encompasses a lot of things that eric is talking about to your point on boston as we had announced earlier we are we announced late last year that we are vacating this headquarters tower at the end of going to move to a new building in boston but is much more flexible better terms lower amount of state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 space and its early enough now that we have ability to customize that even further given what we know about covid19 so again i dont believe that we could operate or should operate anything near workfromhome but we can operate on a much more flexible basis with workfromhome being an integral part of what we do its certainly part of our disaster recovery now so you should start to see us shedding disaster recovery spaces too and you should expect and hold us to a much lower footprint really starting quite soon brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thats great eric and ron thanks for the color and of course eric happy to line up a discussion with my cfo he can give you tips on how to deal with my annoying questions ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp thank you brennan operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin from jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys eric i was wondering if you give us a little bit more color underneath your full year fee outlook and i know given that youve got the crd comments you talked about and then transaction activity but can you kind of walk us through how youre now seeing the bigger buckets move both sequentially and year overyear given the we see average asset pricing we have and your earlier comments about fee income pressure moderating thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp sure ken part of the reason we gave an overall fee guide is that there is there always are and there are always going to be some ins and outs in that in the various fees i think if you think about the different buckets the texture that i gave against the full year guide of to first on servicing fees i think we feel positive weve delivered yearonyear growth in servicing fees now for the first quarter yearonyear and then the second quarter yearonyear and we think that will be a positive for the year and thats different i contrast that the previous year where we had more fee headwinds or where we didnt feel like we had the performance we would have liked but we think servicing fees will be positive and thats without an average equity market uptick really because globally equity markets are kind of in the more flattish range management fees i think are doing well weve been a little more negative there wed like to do a little bit better than what we have done fx trading and then all of the electronic services around that will be a clear positive in fact lending a little lighter as weve described some of the shifts there or the area that we are working on and then in the software and processing fees i think were quite confident on the charles river momentum especially with some of the recent wins and then there is kind of the there are some other in that line there are some other business activity our loan fees or other software fees et cetera and then there is some of the lumpy stuff that we have to just take and mark so all in all though full year to is what we see today which as i think gives us the positive momentum that wed like and then something to build on for next year and state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 our view is if we can drive even lowsingledigit fees upwards and continue to drive expenses down were getting the right results ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah and one big picture one for ron ron last quarter you talked about the a little bit of a pushoff in either installations and client discussions because of just everything that were dealing with your win rate in servicing was about flat can you talk and youve talked about the potential wins in the crd side of wealth management platform can you just talk about just the conversations that are happening now and how thats evolving just in terms of the core business and any sense if thats starting to open up at all ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah ken as we talked about last quarter we said that it was our sense that just given the additional challenges posed to asset managers and asset owners operating models of covid19 that we thought that wed see even at some point an increase in conversations an interest in outsourcing and operating model changes in general and thats actually started to happen and it started to happen in a big way in the second quarter so we see continued interest in not just movement of back office to the lowest price but much more about how do we comprehensively improve how do we our asset owner or asset manager comprehensively improve our operating model through changes to their back office and even to their front office so thats continuing and its as i noted in my opening remarks the as a result of that we would expect to see and be in a position to announce some significant new wins between now and the end of the year that are some combination of front middle and back office of notable names ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thank you ron operator your next question comes from the line of alex blostein from goldman sachs your line is open alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks good morning ron good morning eric so maybe just building on that last comment i want to dig into crd a little bit more as you think about the pipeline in crd and sort of this sizable implementation opportunity you guys see what percentage of that is the onpremise versus kind of the saastype of contract and then secondly i was hoping you guys could dig into the crd wealth strategy a little bit broadly thanks for some of the added disclosure there but what kind of the what are the typical sort of client in the wealth management space is it a wirehouse is it a independent brokerdealers ph and ras so just a little bit more flavor there and which one of these channels incremental growth has been coming from thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp why dont i start there eric can talk about the mix alex but the on the wealth channel it tends to be the higher the larger wealth managers and its a combination if i think about both installed this quarter but also whats where we have conversations and will be installing in future quarters its a combination of the wirehouses and that obviously comes with lots of seats as you would imagine but also the larger private wealth managers i state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 mean they could be rias but again it tends to be the larger ones and the larger names and if you think why that is oftentimes theyre bringing these institutions are bringing some fairly significant asset allocation capability to bear and while they want to give their advisors some freedom to customize they also want to have a lot of control over that and the crd platform works really well in that regard and as i mentioned in response to a earlier question the great thing for us is is that this it certainly is a bespoke application for the wealth segment but its leveraging much of the same underlying technology so there is a lot of scale in all this both in terms of the initial development weve done but also as we roll out software improvements eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp and alex just around that on the financials we had a range of implementations this quarter on the onpremise side ones that are lumpier and the range was three years to eight years and it actually runs the gamut of to in the first year and then the balance ratably i think the largest of implementations was actually on the close to eightyear mark which would be in the first year and the other in the coming years alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you thanks and then just maybe to round out the discussion around nir so eric your comment around kind of stabilizing nir towards the end of the year does that already contemplate significant reinvestment of liquidity that you guys have built up on the balance sheet into securities and loans or with a little more reinvestment to could we maybe even see a little bit of growth from that sort of trough level of net interest revenues thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp yeah alex its a little early to get into to be honest but with the the guide that i gave for does contemplate some reinvestment in the investment portfolio and were just kind of driving the balance but the long end range do have a kind of a tail of effects for us and so in a way this is the time for us to add to the investment portfolio and do our work to offset what would naturally be a downward headwind but i think were weve got a path its just its hard to see growth in nii at this point but we see a path to relative stability within a range but its going to take some work and we dont really know what happens with rates and how they evolve but the we can see a path there alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah that makes sense thanks very much eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp yeah operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc your line is open state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning ron good morning eric ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp good morning eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc ron can you follow up on the new wins that you guys gave us this quarter and you have mentioned in your comments about the stickiness of not losing customers are the wins primarily coming from existing customers where youre adding more products and services and in the cases where you win a new customer i think you alluded to lower prices but can you share with us is it pricedriven that the new customers are coming over or is it a combination of price and better products that youre offering them ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah gerard i dont remember referring to lower pricing in the context of the wins but to answer your questions its a mix that were seeing and right now im referring to the what we call our alpha fronttoback platform and charles river its a mix of existing clients or new clients that were seeing at thats particularly true as i look at the nearterm pipeline so for those existing clients in effect were expanding our share of activity with them to use a vernacular expanding the wallet where we might historically have had a back office custody relationship and were moving to the middle and the front office but beyond that in the kind of more traditional core business we continue to see a fair amount of outsourcing there too firms that had historically done everything but custody inside or where we might have been one or the only custodian are now reconsidering that and moving things like fund accounting out middle office would be another big part of that because in fact our middle office business is the outsourcing of their back office and that solves lots of challenges for them and weve learned how to scale that business so that would give you a sense of all that i mean what has been pleasing about the pipeline as its developed and again given the comprehensive nature of what we do these pipelines do take a while to move from when theres the first contact to the actual signing of the business but whats pleasing about that is were seeing a fair number of new clients there to us and the attractive thing about that is to really get the full advantage of the fronttoback platform were able to show that we can do the charles river and middle office for you but where you are going to get real data advantages is having the full fronttoback so it fuels growth in our traditional back office business gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then eric i know its not as material to your business as a traditional bank but your loan portfolio you mentioned you ph baked it in some of the leveraged loans two questions one can you give us state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 any color on the industries in which you derisk a balance sheet from and second what type of pricing did you see when you sold those leveraged loans thank you eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp sure gerard we are trying to be proactive here right the leveraged loan market has really moved up and down a good bit and just finding some points where it might make sense we derisked roughly about million of balances of leveraged loans i remember one of the cinema chains was in that and we got out of the good price i think the average pricing on the exits was around i think around i want to say on the dollar so somewhere in that range so we feel like we have made some good tactical decisions it didnt cost us that much we would have to build a reserve anyway for those and thats why i said on that million it cost effectively in that fix but for the peace of mind and just trying to be careful because we are a trusted custody bank and thats our brand we felt like it was a good trade and well continue to selectively do that but in truth we feel quite good about this loan book i mean its a most leveraged loans are in the indices are single b and below ours are bb and sometimes even better and so i think were pretty confident here but there is always something and were happy to be proactive and make some tactical decisions and thats what we did gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi so youre guiding for better fee growth for this year to versus down before how much of that is already reflected in the first half results and how much should be coming in the second half you mentioned servicing fee management fees fx processing but is this mostly reflecting what youve done already or is it mostly the comp and as a subcomponent of that when it comes to crd i guess linked quarter revenues were up million and pretax was up million so i guess thats what a incremental profit margin so that leaves me to ask are there some upfront revenues with the new business wins in terms of timing between the revenues and expenses how does that work out and then honestly if i can throw it in there you were going to be client of crd and how is that moving along thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp sure mike its eric let me take the first couple and then i think ron will probably want to take the third in terms of the full year guide youre right there is a number of different pieces to it there is some pieces of the full year to fee revenue guide that are driven by the first half of the year and there is some that will be driven by i think continued progress in the second half i think if you just go through the line items servicing fees has been good for the first half and we expect them to we continue to be good but i think that will be a continued story management fees largely because of the market i think a little lighter in the first half were hoping that they come in a little stronger on a yearonyear basis in the second half fx obviously a firsthalf story where the second half will not be there sec finance has been light for us in the first half were hoping for some and looking for some stability there and some sequential stability if not some a little bit of uptick and then you have charles river where we obviously state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 got a big part in the second quarter and that may be end up being a little more firsthalf weighted but i think you typically get performance in the fourth quarter of these software businesses so well see i think some activity there so a little bit of a mix to be honest on charles river the good question on the onpremise installation in particular or the renewals but i think its really on a kind of combination of the new implementations you do get some professional servicing fees where we build revenues and we incur expenses and my recollection is those are is fairly aligned the accounting standards encourage us to do that but i think the professional services tend to be billed as incurred and then and part of the what i described as the more stable part of the revenues and what were finding is there is just a there is professional services installation work that we do for kind of coming clients clients that are not yet implemented but are on their way to implementation there is some during the implementation that last sprint and then there is clients behind that so its a bit of a mix to be honest but something we can try to parse out a little bit more detail in future conferences or calls ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp mike regarding the last part of your question which is state street global advisors becoming a client of charles river theyre actually becoming a client of the full alpha fronttoback platform including charles river so its a fairly comprehensive install and its underway the installation is happening mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc because you are going to be like that will be a nice showcase once you get that done as you say we use it ourselves you should use it too kind of what inning are you in as far implementing it internally ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp i mean im somewhat speculating here now but were well over half installed is the way i would describe it and again its not just installing charles river but its moving the state street global advisors back office to our middle office platform its accommodating some existing technology that they have in place too so as youd imagine its a trillion asset manager its pretty complicated but its well over half way along mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just one last clarification eric so the crd revenues should we million in the second quarter and should i know this is getting pretty granular but is that something thats kind of lumpy or we should extrapolate that out or how should we think about that eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp no its lumpy and mike thats why i was trying to give a little bit of color but just to reaffirm in that million we said there are kind of very recurring really kind of recurring revenues of just over million and then the balance is in the kind of lumpy category where you get these onpremise installations so you kind of have to take a piece of the lumpy and say there is always going to be lumpy because we have threeyear contracts five year contracts threeyear contracts and every quarter every year there is some of those contracts roll over and so youre going to get a new lumpiness or you get new business that you add in the lumpy category state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 i also gave if you want another quarter as a contrast back a year ago second quarter of we have million of total revenues and i said we had about million of the very kind of recurring saas and professional services revenues and just a smaller piece of that was lumpy so you can kind of i think draw some lines and the lumpiness this is big lumpy thats for sure but there is always going to be some but i think hopefully i have given you enough on the kind of saas and the professional services the you extrapolate from there and then put in something in the models on the lumpy part mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks a lot eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp yeah operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell from seaport global securities your line is open james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just we could talk a little bit of a question on the new business wins youve had and the cadence and impact if i look at new business to be installed you have about trillion to go thats been pretty stable since the big wins in so is it on these bigger wins does it just really take this long is there something unusual here and i guess going forward with the new business wins youve alluded to in the second half this year is it a similar kind of time to install ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah jim its a good question when you see this kind of tobeinstalled backlog if you will that typically reflects that there is multiple tranches of business so for example it could be custodian fund accounting and middle office and a custody conversion we can do very quickly right we literally did some we were notified by a client that they wanted to move in the midst of the crisis and we got it done intraquarter those move quickly and so oftentimes dont even show up in this backlog here i mean they would if it was carrying over to a quarter what youre seeing here is clients including some very large clients that have multiple tranches of business that they are either moving over from an existing provider or in some cases moving from an insourced to an outsourced model and again that reflects the nature of our business were using our ability to do these kind of outsourcing to actually drive not just the outsourced business but to drive traditional core custody which scales easily and is quite profitable to us but thats how you should think about that is that in any given quarter our new business wins will be some very traditional custodytocustody kinds of things or fund accounting to fund accounting but oftentimes a backlog reflects just much more comprehensive kinds of moves james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right and should we assume that those more complex deals have a higher fee rate should we see a little bit more of a material impact on servicing fees when they close state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp what you should expect to see is that there is fees coming from more than one source right the custody fee a fund accounting fee a middle office fee james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp so thats how you should think about it james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja from jpmorgan your line is open ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp vivek we cant hear you operator vivek if youre on mute please unmute ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp are you there vivek operator and there are no further questions at
