followup question after a followup question please return to the queue and now its my pleasure to turn the call over to roger roger c hochschild president chief executive officer director discover financial services thanks eric and thanks to our listeners for joining todays call in my comments this morning im going to address three topics our strategic and financial highlights for the first quarter the expected impact of the current environment on our results and some of the exciting advancements weve made around our dei and esg reporting starting on slide we had another quarter of outstanding results with earnings of billion after tax or per share our earnings this quarter were the result of consistent execution on our business priorities against the backdrop of complex economic and geopolitical conditions consistent with our expectations our loan growth accelerated to from the prior year as we benefited from continued strong sales and investments in new account acquisition last year and into yearoveryear card sales were up with improvement in all categories theres been a lot of discussion about the impact of energy price inflation on consumer spending we believe that higher prices at the pump were a relatively small contributor to sales volume adding approximately basis points to our first quarter volume growth discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 we also continue to lean into account acquisition and new accounts grew yearoveryear with particular strength in the prime cashback segment reflecting our attractive value proposition credit performance remains strong with credit losses normalizing in line with our expectations this is an outgrowth of our consistent focus on prime lending and our strong credit management throughout the pandemic along with robust labor market conditions importantly we have not seen evidence of credit stress beyond the moderate pace of normalization that we anticipated coming into the year in fact as john will address later were narrowing our expectations for credit losses to the low end of our prior range we continue to effectively manage expenses while making investments for profitable growth analytic capabilities and product enhancements as our account growth demonstrates were making significant investments in card growth but were also focused on innovation in our noncard offerings to further enhance our full suite of digital banking and lending products in early april we launched our cashback debit product this product is digitally native including a mobilefirst customer experience it provides features like early access to paychecks as well as items that others will struggle to match including no fees cashback on debit transactions and our industryleading service we plan on investing more for growth of this product with broad market advertising later this year now let me talk about how we expect the current environment to impact discover we provide some views on macro conditions on slide the most pressing issue is russias invasion of the ukraine naturally our primary concern is for the resulting humanitarian crisis and the wellbeing of the ukrainian people as well as for our employees and customers with close ties to this nation from the more narrow perspective of our business we currently have no activities in either country and we do not anticipate any material impacts on our business from the war we have indefinitely suspended our efforts to open an office in russia and while we have temporarily paused our certification of a diners club bank issuing partner in ukraine we plan on moving forward as soon as we can the war in ukraine and the resulting sanctions against russia have also raised concerns about the risk of recession globally and domestically we do not see any evidence of this across our consumer lending portfolio our credit metrics remain good and there is nothing were seeing in terms of consumer spending or borrowing behavior that suggests that a broader downturn is imminent another concern has been the significant elevation and flattening of the yield curve given the anticipation by the rates market around aggressive monetary policy from the federal reserve to stem high inflation because we are modestly asset sensitive the potential for a greater number of fed rate hikes has improved our outlook for spread income which john will discuss momentarily and while were not immune from the effects of inflation our business model has somewhat of a natural hedge as the pressure that inflation may create on elements of our expense structure are partially offset by the contribution inflation makes to our sales volume in summary while macro conditions are much more fluid than we had thought coming into this year were positioned to benefit from the combination of strong sales and receivables growth expanding margin and slowly normalizing credit these trends give us confidence in our outlook over our forecast horizon discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 finally i want to point out our new esgrelated disclosures in march we produced our first diversity equity and inclusion transparency report which highlights our commitment to supporting a diverse workforce that reflects our communities and customers we also recently published our first esg summary that includes details on our greenhouse gas emissions among other items the data in our new reports is encouraging but we intend to do more to reduce our impact on the environment and to advance diversity and equity in our organization and communities with that ill turn the call over to john to review our financial results in more detail and provide an update to our expectations for the rest of john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger and good morning everyone once again our results this quarter reflect strong execution on our business priorities with accelerating loan growth and solid credit performance ill begin with our financial summary results on slide there are a few things id like to call out here the first is that our net income is lower yearoveryear because of our reserving actions in the first quarter of last year we had an million reserve release while this quarter included a million release adjusting for reserve changes our profit before tax and reserves would have been up yearoveryear second our reported total revenue net of interest expense increased million or from the prior year however this included million net loss in equity investments excluding this loss total revenue increased these points underscore the strength of our core earnings power even in a fluid economic environment lets turn to the details of the quarter looking at slide net interest income was up million or driven by improved net interest margin and higher average receivables nim was up basis points from the prior year and basis points from the prior quarter the yearoveryear increase in net interest margin reflects lower funding costs and a favorable shift in funding mix partially offset by a higher mix of promotional rate balances we made further progress on our funding mix with consumer deposits now making up of total funding on a sequential basis the modest increase in nim was driven by a slightly improved revolve rate on credit card loans partially offset by increased funding costs the better revolve rate reflected a basis point decline in the payment rate quarteroverquarter this helped boost sequential loan yields by basis points however the payment rate remains nearly basis points above prepandemic levels we continue to expect that the normalization in the payment rate will continue through the back half of receivables were higher driven by card which increased yearoveryear from the continued strong sales and robust new account growth last year and into this year organic student loans increased reflecting solid originations through the peak season personal loans were down due to a sustained high payment rate looking at other revenue on slide excluding the million loss in equity investments noninterest income increased million or this was driven by net discount and interchange revenue which was up million or reflecting strong sales sales were up yearoveryear with growth across all categories discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 inflation drove a modest portion of the growth in the quarter and we expect that inflation will remain a benefit to sales growth over the short term strong sales also drove higher rewards expense compared to the prior year however the rewards rate was down basis points yearoveryear we still anticipate the full year rewards rate to increase to basis points loan fee income was up million or primarily driven by an increase in late fee instances moving to expenses on slide total operating expenses were up million or yearoveryear excluding marketing investments expenses increased just compensation expense was slightly down yearoveryear on lower bonus accruals and head count which was partially offset by higher average salaries we expect some degree of salary and wage pressure in and possibly into as we take steps to remain competitive marketing expense increased million or we continue to invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products including support of our relaunched cashback debit product information processing increased million or yearoveryear versus a low level in the period a year ago this expense was flat sequentially going forward we will continue to prioritize investments in analytics to support growth innovation and generate operating efficiencies moving to slide net chargeoffs remained low and were in line with our expectation for modest credit normalization total net chargeoffs were basis points lower than the prior year and up basis points from last quarters record low total net chargeoff dollars were down million from the prior year and up million sequentially moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide this quarter we released million from reserves and our reserve rate continued to decline dropping basis points to the reserve release primarily reflects the sustained strong credit performance in our portfolio partially offset by loan growth looking at the macroeconomic environment the pandemic now has a lesser impact on our outlook the primary sources of risk have shifted to the impacts of inflation and a potential slowdown from fed actions while the risk has shifted the economic view of the us consumer remains healthy looking at slide our common equity tier for the period was slightly lower than the prior period and still well above our target we repurchased million of common stock during the quarter executing on our remaining authorization our board of directors also approved a new billion shares repurchase program that expires on june and increased our common stock dividend by to per share this repurchase authorization represents our largest ever over a fivequarter horizon it is evidence of our commitment to returning excess capital to shareholders while sustaining our investments in strong organic growth concluding on slide our outlook for remains favorable and we are improving some elements of our expectations starting with loans spending trends through the first quarter and a modest decline in the payment rates improved our conviction for high singledigit growth we are revising our view on nim we now see to basis points of upside for the full year relative to the first quarter this view includes five fed rate hikes at basis points each our prior view reflected two rate hikes of the same magnitude if the fed increases rates beyond this it would provide modest upside to net interest margin despite inflationary pressures theres no change to our guidance for operating expense marketing is expected to be above levels with nonmarketing expenses up low singledigits discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 we are improving our credit outlook we expect losses to be between and for the full year while theres still some uncertainty about the back half of this year our current credit performance and delinquency trends give us confidence in a tighter range and as previously mentioned our board recently approved a new share repurchase program and increased our dividend in summary loan growth accelerated as we benefited from robust sales and strong account acquisitions last year and into credit performance reflected our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management with moderate normalization as expected we manage operating expenses while investing in new product features and functionalities and our highly capitalgenerative model enable us to increase our dividend and share repurchase authorization while supporting strong organic asset growth these results demonstrate the resiliency and flexibility of our integrated digital banking and payments model and im confident that we are wellpositioned for continued profitable growth through a range of economic conditions with that ill turn the call back to our operator to open the line for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning roger and john roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning bill john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc competitive intensity and elevated expense pressures are leading your peers to report negative operating leverage but you just reported over basis points of positive operating leverage and your results certainly stand out that degree of positive operating leverage was much stronger than i think anyone was expecting can you frame for us whether an efficiency ratio here in the range is sustainable john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 hey bill thanks for the question so certainly we were pleased with the execution in the quarter and in terms of the specifics around efficiency ratio what weve guided to in the past and were still holding there is that over the mediumterm we would expect an efficiency ratio in the upper now this quarter certainly demonstrated some progress on that front there is a bit of timing there we kept our marketing guidance as we indicated before which would bring that above levels so theres a slight skewing towards the back half of the year we continue to invest for growth there will be some upper funnel or broad market advertising as well so were watching every dollar and making sure we get an appropriate return for our shareholders as we invest it whether from an expense standpoint or from a loan lending standpoint so i dont want to get over our skis here on that efficiency ratio strong execution and were going to continue to kind of work towards the mediumterm target bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats helpful if i may follow up on capital from the cet1 level that youre at today would you expect capital consumed through loan growth and the billion authorization that you announced to be enough to get you down to that target over the next five quarters or would you still expect to be sort of running above at that point and how much flexibility do you see in that billion is there some chance we could see you take that higher depending on how things play out john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes so in terms of the cet1 ratio were sticking to the target there is about basis points from cecl transition still yet to impact that cet1 ratio so then that still puts us over basis points above the target i just expressed so our thinking is that over the next two three perhaps four years depending on investments and the broad economy to close down to the target but in terms of the repurchase authorization our board just approved it so itd be way premature to talk about any changes to that bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc great thank you for taking my questions john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services of course thanks bill operator and well take our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead your line is open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning so roger you talked about the fluidity of the macro and obviously youve been through a number of these cycles as have you john im just curious i know youre not seeing anything right now but whats the playbook from here i know you guys are leaning into growth but if things suddenly change how are you how would you react discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yes thanks sanjay so in terms of leaning into growth i would say were pleased with our growth but it remains balanced in terms of the investments were making i expect our prime cost per account to be down from last year so were not in any way overinvesting by and large our credit policies are back to where they were prepandemic but as we said at that time it was late cycle so were not exactly letting credit go so were still executing on a model of a disciplined growth even as the economic environment especially the us consumer remains strong sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and i guess maybe just following up on interest rate sensitivity john could you just talk about what youre seeing any i know you raised the nim expectations but any changes in sort of industry behavior around chasing rates from competitor banks and such maybe could you just talk about deposit beta thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes sure sanjay so in terms of competitor behavior so we have seen the competitor set that we benchmark ourselves against recently through this quarter this past quarter increased rates and into this quarter we as you observed our behavior in the pandemic we moved fairly aggressively down as a matter of fact we led our competitive set on the interest rate movements downward now that were in a rising rate environment my expectation is were going to be disciplined around that so the principles are that we want to ensure we have a fair customer proposition we also seek to kind of manage our interest costs as effectively as we can so a combination of funding needs and competitive dynamics will dictate how we how and when we take deposit pricing actions sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you operator and well take our next question from moshe orenbuch please go ahead your line is open moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks i guess i was hoping for roger if you could talk a little bit about the competitive environment and obviously theres been a lot going on from some of your competitors you talked about an kind of growth in new accounts and your marketing expense was pretty much under control so can you just talk about what it is that allows you to kind of do that and be comfortable in terms of your account growth going forward roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 sure thanks moshe i think it really comes down to having a balanced and distinctive value proposition the discover brand is one of the most trusted brands in financial services we provide a leading customer experience both through the phone and digitally which helps with retention as well as booking new accounts we spent a long time building our skills around managing cash rewards not just paying the higher rate but focused on every part of the process and then continuing to innovate with new features and functionality and you saw we just launched another one around helping protect your information from people reselling it on the web and so that i think allows us to succeed in just about any environment i view the card business as always competitive occasionally theres a lull in the depths of a recession but beyond that its our job to execute for our owners and grow and youre seeing that this quarter and im confident well be able to keep it going moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks maybe just a followup in a completely different direction and that is you talked about the debit product can you just talk a little bit more about how much in resources youre putting behind that how big it could be and are there any other areas in which you can kind of leverage the network in the coming year thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure so the network does give us advantages for both our credit card issuing business but also in terms of being able to support the cash back on debit purchases which is a real differentiator in the marketplace and builds on the discover heritage with cashback in a new direction so well work our way into it as john mentioned well start broad market advertising for that product later this year but we intend to sort of scale it gradually and build for the longterm over time we expect it to be a key part of our business and then we see advantages on our core card issuing business good example is our ability as we roll out src to preenroll our customers in a way that will be much more challenging for issuers on a thirdparty network and finally we remain focused on the payment services business monetizing our network investments through attracting thirdparty volume moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks very much operator and well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services morning betsy john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc nice growth in the quarter and a really nice pickup especially as we moved into end of period here and i just wanted to get a sense as to how youre thinking about funding that continued strong growth as we move through the year given that youve got the fed shrinking the balance sheet and probably some deposits growth slowdown i looked at the liquidity balances it looks like theyre down to prepandemic lows which well during the pandemic i should say so im just thinking through deposit growth versus liquidity utilization versus wholesale funding how should we think about how youre planning on funding the loan growth thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes great thanks betsy so in terms of loan growth were going to take a balanced approach so we talked about the target of to of our funding needs coming from osa or deposits from our customer base theres always the opportunity to go into the market and execute on broker cds if liquidity needs dictate that we also issued an abs transaction this past quarter in a rising rate environment at pretty compelling rates overall so were going to take that balanced approach and you will see or we did if you havent seen it youll see a little bit more of it therell be a little bit more broad market marketing on deposits and then also targeted marketing on deposits and were going to try to balance kind of the rate and the marketing in order to get the most effective cost of funds as we can so thats essentially the strategy in a nutshell so we actually just went through a review from the fed on our liquidity controls and its come out very very strong so were pleased with the position of the business and the processes around it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great and then just as a followup you indicated i think earlier john that the outlook that you have for nim includes five rate hikes from the fed john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and maybe you could help us understand as we go to that six seven eight nine rate hike thats expected how does your asset sensitivity change if at all or should we just take whats in the 10q and apply that to whatever comes after fed rate hike five discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes so the math on it would be for a basis point increase somewhere between bps and bps to nim on an annual basis now theres a bunch of other dynamics that obviously impact that right so you touched upon it earlier so deposit pricing could impact that as well as the revolve rate payment rate and then the credit impacts coming through net interest margin so theres a lot of dynamics there and that was why we are conservative in terms of the number of hikes that we baked into this updated guidance if there are more hikes and were able to kind of effectively manage our liquidity credit remains as we expect we would certainly see some upside from that guidance we provided betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc but in the same like bp to bp range per basis point john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services and thats an annual basis betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah i got that thanks john john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services you got it operator and well take our next question from john pancari with evercore please go ahead your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning as a followup to i think it was sanjays question earlier just around deposit beta could you just tell us what is your deposit beta assumption thats baked into your nim guidance that you just mentioned john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 yeah so thanks john so i dont really kind of think about this in terms of a deposit beta what i do here is think about it in terms of broad principles so the principles are that were going to have an attractive proposition for our customers and that were going to manage interest costs as low as we can while still maintaining that proposition i just talked about so i gave the point in terms of our actions during the pandemic when we had plenty of liquidity that we were a price leader down and what i said in this rising rate environment we expect that were going to manage that interest cost very very tightly in order to hopefully drive overall cost low increase nim and benefit shareholders so i dont want to kind of tag to a specific beta because they tend to be the numbers tend to be kind of off a month from now so john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thats helpful and then separately just regarding the broader economic backdrop given the feds efforts here to tame inflation and slow the economy and then looks like this morning were getting a probably a disappointing print here on gdp im curious does your outlook factor in a slowdown in card spend at all john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services it does so actually it was the for the quarter was higher than we anticipated were frankly happy to see that but there is a modest stepping down through this year effectively its hard to envision yearoveryear kind of sales growth to continue in the upper john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay great thank you operator and well take our next question from ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services good morning roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 john maybe to follow up on a couple of the questions that have been asked i think the focus has been on the liability side of the balance sheet as it pertains to rate sensitivity but maybe we could talk a little bit about the asset side and im just curious obviously a lot has changed over the last few years so maybe can you unpack a little bit for us have we seen significant changes in terms of floating rates relative to the last time rates rose how much more improvement do you think we could see in revolve rates and i guess lastly are we now back to more sustainable bt level such that we can see the asset yields improving with benchmark rates thanks and i have a followup john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay thanks ryan so theres a lot there so revolve rate actually increased mildly in the quarter as the payment rate decreased by the basis points that i spoke about and by the way that payment rate decline was essentially in line with how we built our original guidance so as we think about inflation or other impacts that could drive payment rate lower weve essentially derisked our guidance for loan growth so we could see additional upside subject to payment rate and a bunch of other factors the other pieces there in terms of kind of overall asset growth what i would do is i would break it down into kind of the three categories our primary products so card you saw the doubledigit growth there student loans at so well have another peak origination season coming in we hope to be able to execute there and continue to take market share and personal loans the growth was down but originations were up strong double digits so we had a high payment rate impacting personal loans that we expect to moderate over time giving some level of loan growth in that product so i guess your question had a number of elements hopefully i gave you enough detail to be able to piece together the information youre trying to glean ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah and maybe as a followup on credit it was good to see you lowering the highend of the range and i understand you probably have about six months of visibility so the fourth quarter is probably still hard to predict but just looking at some of the credit metrics delinquencies remain really really benign theyre only up basis points on the bottom so can you maybe just talk about whats included now in the credit expectations and do we have the potential to see credit come in towards the bottom end of the range over the course of the year thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 yeah so when we gave this initial guidance we gave a pretty broad range and we batted around internally whether or not we should tighten it and as the quarter unfolded our conviction around that tighter range and perhaps the lower end grew so as you said theres three months the fourth quarter we dont have perfect visibility in terms of kind of roll rate performance but our modeling analytics have been actually surprisingly accurate and we have a high expectation there so well see how the rest of this quarter plays out and hopefully we can give updated guidance in a subsequent call ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks john operator and we will take our next question from mark devries with barclays please go ahead your line is open mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc thank you so your reserve rate is still about points above cecl day one can you just talk about what assumptions are embedded in that how we should think about that ratio if a recession happens in the nearterm as some are expecting i mean it would seem these levels thats almost already in the reserve and alternatively where could it go if some of this macro uncertainty clears john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services right thanks mark so yes the reserve rate came in at cecl day one was so some context around cecl day one so it was an accounting adjustment reflecting new guidance provided by the fasb right so we did our best to capture life of loan estimates of what losses would be and embed them in our overall reserve rate now the macro environment at the time versus today has certainly changed portfolio dynamics have changed as a matter of fact our the upper end of our kind of credit quality for the balance sheet is stronger than it was cecl day one but theres still a degree of uncertainty that we are managing through so as we said in prior quarters were conservative on this we want to make sure that were appropriately capturing reserve rates under gaap if the broad macros are positive and the portfolio performance is positive we could continue to step down through a combination of growth or reserve releases and if the recession likelihood continues to increase the broad macros could warrant either holding or perhaps even increasing but overall i think the takeaway here should be mark that the portfolio performance is really really strong theres no view of any damage to the consumer theres no view that job losses are going to increase in the definitely through this year and likely through the first half of next year so all those factors are positive from a credit and reserving standpoint mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay got it and then just a clarifying question on the opex guidance you indicated no change there despite what seemed like kind of growing wage inflation pressures that youve indicated youre not immune to should we assume that as that pressure kind of builds in the second half that what happens as you flex down kind of other nonmarketing nonwage expense to maintain some kind of a targeted operating leverage discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes so heres how we think about it so and ive tried to articulate this over the past years were going to be really disciplined in terms of how we spend our dollars and discover has got a long history of that weve done some stuff to kind of drive both accountability and visibility of the expense base which my sense is it has helped its important to note that as we see opportunities were going to continue to invest we also are as you paraphrased were seeing inflation coming in on salary and wages were also seeing it in thirdparty spend so we will have effectively managed that in order to be able to deliver to the guidance we provided and if we see incremental opportunity either for growth or otherwise well invest to and well create transparency on that in order to drive longterm shareholder returns mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay great thank you operator and well take our next question from kevin barker with piper sandler please go ahead your line is open kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you when you consider this rate environment versus the last rate cycle do you feel that the deposit betas that are going to play out in this cycle are going to mirror what we saw in the last cycle or and is that your base case when you think about funding costs despite what might be a much more aggressive fed this time around john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes last time i would take out as a proxy but theres couple of things that are different right so the pace of inflation is a heck of a lot higher here right were at record levels of inflation the other thing that is different is the savings rate coming into this inflationary cycle much higher so those two dynamics could create some offsetting impacts but it will be subject to kind of liquidity and loan growth across the industry and whos got a competitive proposition and were very comfortable with our proposition in terms of the customer experience the kind of the rate and if you take a look at our rate versus a brickandmortar bank i find it ironic that anybody keeps any excess cash in those institutions whatsoever so were going to be diligent on it kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay and then you mentioned that youre very disciplined on how you spend your dollars youre pretty consistent on that commentary are you seeing anywhere where some of your competition may be a little exuberant in how theyre spending in dollars just given the opportunity set in the market today roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yes i would say in general in this business you get diminishing returns on incremental investments in marketing and so you have seen cycles in the past where people spend heavily after a while they look at the returns they got and maybe less happy with that so we feel good about both what were investing on the rewards side and the guidance we provide there of only to basis point increase but also that well see cost per discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 accounts at an attractive level youre certainly seeing very heavy levels of investment out there that i would wonder whether or not theyre going to be sustainable kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you for taking my questions operator and well go next to don fandetti with wells fargo please go ahead your line is open donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes good morning i know home equity is a small part of your business but i didnt know if there was maybe a growing opportunity as a lot of the sort of cash out refi activity could potentially slow and then secondly i think you have a partnership on accounttoaccount payments i was just curious if you think that will take off at the point of sale in the united states roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yes so in terms of our home equity business we do think a rising rate environment will be very constructive perversely many households their greatest asset could be their mortgage so while were excited about it it also isnt that huge on the payment side were excited about our partnership but i dont see tremendous disruption coming to point of sale and existing means of payment point of sale anytime soon but were excited to work with a broad range of partners and different fintechs who want to leverage our network capabilities donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator and we will take our next question from rick shane with jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks everybody for taking my question this morning can you talk a little bit behaviorally about the stratification youre seeing in terms of borrower behavior both in terms of credit performance and also in terms of spending behavior discretionary versus nondiscretionary shifts across the portfolio roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure seeing strength across all categories revolver sales growth is probably a little higher than transactor sales growth but that reflects our lendfocused model but and that sales strength is continuing into april where through say the 24th sales are still up yearoveryear so consumer is good and breadth across all categories in terms of different segments from a credit standpoint you do tend to see normalization occur faster at the lower end segments but again were very pleased and john mentioned that in his comments that the normalization is very much in line with our expectations quite frankly discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it and roger are you seeing in that lower fico band any shift in terms of spending behavior from category to category roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services not necessarily theres been a lot of volatility just as pandemic restrictions come and go certainly travel growth is up compared to what it was but id really point towards breadth and growth in spend across all categories richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you very much guys operator and well take our next question from robert napoli with william blair please go ahead your line is open robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you good morning and congratulations on a really good quarter i mean discover has been a model of consistency over the last decade plus so its just good to see just on your cashback debit product just thoughts on the growth of that business the penetration rate any comments on some of the other bankinglike products in early paycheck what kind of demand youre seeing for that product and then economically how youre going to monetize these banking products over time roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure its still early days so i probably wont provide much in the way of forecast but were very excited about the demand were seeing we think the product is positioned well to compete both with some of the newer fintech neobanks but also with any traditional branch player thats out there and over time the balances build slowly but a lot of opportunities to crosssell both other deposit products such as savings accounts and cds but also our broad range of card products and provide really a different entry point into the discover franchise so very much our focus is on building this for the long term and as we said earlier youll start seeing more broad market advertising later this year for that product robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc great and then just any thoughts roger on the competitive positioning of discover today versus say five years ago prepandemic five years ago your ability to maintain or gain share while maintaining returns i mean youve done so very nicely but just any thoughts on the competitive position today versus say five years ago discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yes i mean id go back to the very kind comments you made at the beginning around years of consistency right even five years ago a brand value proposition that stood for trust for a superior customer experience and for innovation on the feature side back then it might have been the ability to freeze your card now its some of the things we do for our customers in terms of protecting their information online but the focus remains the same a very strong cash rewards program that competes well with anything out there youre pricing a little more intensity in the cash rewards space as some of the changes on miles programs through the pandemic but we still compete very much the same way but also still feel as good about our competitive position robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you appreciate it operator and well take our next question from mihir bhatia with bank of america please go ahead your line is open mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thank you for taking my questions firstly obviously really solid results here this quarter so i guess congratulations on that but maybe you could just talk a little bit about washington were hearing more noises out there both from the cfpb on the late fees and which i guess to a certain extent kind of plays into your brand about less fees and being consumerfriendly but still obviously will have an impact for you to the extent i think yesterday he announced or this week he announced hes talking about reopening the card act and the fees there but also just on the student loan forgiveness side too were hearing more rumblings on that so just whats going on with washington your views on the situation thank you roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yes sure so on the fee side first id say we have good relationships and enjoy working closely with all of our regulators and by and large are aligned in terms of wanting the consumers to be protected technical difficulty as youve seen its a pretty small percent of our revenues we waive the first late fee for our discover it customers anyway right now were set at the safe harbor to the extent that that changes we can change accordingly but dont expect it to have an overly material impact certainly on the deposit side the fact that we have no fees on any of our deposit products positions us very very well compared to our competitors and its a key part of our value proposition in terms of student loans we probably have seen some pressure on the payment rate just given the ongoing payment holidays that people have seen on their federal loan its important to realize though that theres a big difference between the federal loan program and ours just in terms of who they give loans to the types of educations they fund as an example we do nothing in the forprofit sector so yeah well wait and see what comes out of washington but we dont expect it to be overly disruptive for our own student loan business mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 okay thank you and then just maybe turning back to credit for a second obviously youre improving the outlook for this year but how much of that is just a function of you gaining increased confidence based on and the outperformance maybe versus any kind of change i guess really what im trying to understand is is the path to normalization changing or is the curve like from here like a little less steep than what you had maybe expected it to be like when do we get back to a normalized state is it the front half of the back half of john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes thanks for the question mihir what we said previously is we expect that normalization through now its really hard to kind of predict anything when you get out out into the kind of timeframe what i would say here is in terms of narrowing the range that was a function largely of increased confidence around our forecast with frankly an internal expectation that were going to come in at the lower end of the range so were still giving ourselves some wiggle room here but if things proceed as we expect them to well be around the lower end of the range mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc thank you operator and well take our next question from john hecht with jefferies please go ahead your line is open john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thanks guys most of my questions have been asked but i guess turning to the student lending business i mean its important i know its small but important overall but your results have been pretty consistent there but im wondering maybe if you just have any thoughts on the moratorium its impact on your business and more importantly is when the moratorium expires is there any broader effect that you would expect to see on overall credit trends even outside that specific segment roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yes weve modeled it pretty carefully we dont expect it to have a significant impact on card or personal loans and as you think about student loans its important to look at how we underwrite those right for our undergrad loans the vast majority are cosigned by the parent very strong fico scores so weve seen probably a modest benefit on the benefit on the credit side but also a modest negative on the payment rate as students have more liquidity to put towards paying off their private student loans and again id go back to the federal student loan program in terms of who participates the amount of debt they have and the nature of the education they finance is dramatically different than our portfolio john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay makes sense thanks operator and well take our last question from meng jiao with deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks guys for taking my question just a quick question on the personal loan portfolio i guess are you sort of tightening standards there just given the pristine early stage and loss rates that weve seen there but im also looking at the sequential sort of sevenquarter decline in yield so just wanted to get your thoughts there or is it just sort of primarily the elevated payment rates thats driving that thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes its a couple of factors that are playing out here so the first piece was when we came in prior to coming into the pandemic we were pretty tight and then we hit the pandemic and we tightened the personal loan product more stringently than any other product we had what and then we also we doubled down on our underwriting including verification of all loans so we were super careful that had an impact on growth levels we have since reduced our manual underwriting so its back to kind of prepandemic underwriting standards and we also opened up the credit box because what we are seeing is the loans that were in there were pristine and were now in a situation where weve got a highreturning asset were looking at the competitive dynamics weve made some conscious choice to reduce yield for the benefit of very profitable growth and as i said earlier in my comments the expectation is that the payment rate will subside and well see growth in loan balances in that product originations have been positively strong as i said earlier as well meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it great thank you operator and there are no further questions eric wasserstrom vice president corporate strategy investor relations discover financial services great thank you ashley and with that i think well conclude if you have any additional questions please feel free to
