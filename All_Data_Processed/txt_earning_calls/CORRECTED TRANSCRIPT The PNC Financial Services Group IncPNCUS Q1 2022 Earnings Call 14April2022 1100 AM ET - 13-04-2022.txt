call over to bill william stanton demchak chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bryan and good morning everybody as youve seen we had a solid start to the year as we grew loans and securities controlled expenses and our credit quality reserves and capital levels remain very strong as we previously disclosed noninterest income was below our expectations for the quarter and while we had expected fees to be down sequentially reflecting typical first quarter seasonality the decline actually exceeded normal interest rate volatility and probably the russianukraine conflict adversely impacted certain of our capital markets businesses among other areas the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 as we look forward were clearly in an environment of uncertainty here were also in an environment with rising interest rates which benefit banks with increased loan demand which benefit banks and in pncs case a business or a bank that never changed its credit box when credit terms got really easy a business that has a very or a bank that has a very solid mix of feebased businesses and importantly a bank that has substantially expanded its geographic presence and i want to hit on that in a second just as it relates to our progress on bbva i would tell you i just i couldnt be more proud of what weve been able to accomplish over the last about months in total now but in particular over the last couple of quarters and we still have a lot of work to do but to put it in perspective our staffing is largely complete and our calling effort particularly versus the fourth quarter has increased substantially and our sales and pipelines are robust just to give you an idea of the activity behind this in the legacy bbva usa geographies corporate commercial banking costs have doubled since the fourth quarter and sales have increased almost as we expected across cib nearly half of these sales were actually noncredit related in the legacy bbva usa geographies we switch to the retail side were obviously focused on building customer relationships just to give you an idea our sales per branch were approximately higher in march compared to what they were in december with improvements across mortgages cards and referrals to pnc investments in our asset management group were making great progress and strategic investments to hire key people in business development and advisor roles and importantly our client opportunity pipelines are really strong from a balance sheet perspective we continue to deploy our excess liquidity as youve seen with solid loan growth and securities purchases spot loans grew billion in the quarter driven by the commercial side which saw a nice increase in utilization in fact if we exclude the impact of ppp loan forgiveness spot commercial loans grew billion the fastest organic quarterly growth weve seen since the commercial defensive draws that we saw at the start of the pandemic and by the way weve seen that growth carry into the early part of april we also remain active on the securities side with net purchases of almost billion during the quarter from a balance sheet perspective the securities were offset by unrealized losses due to rising interest rates which rob is going to discuss in a few minutes this doesnt impact our regulatory capital or earnings but during the quarter we moved approximately billion of our securities available for sale to help the maturity to limit future valuation changes due to interest rate movements importantly we saw a solid rebound in the yield on our securities overall we believe we are well positioned for the rising interest rate environment to deliver net interest income growth and nim expansion throughout the year finally during the quarter we returned about billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and importantly based on our performance our strong capital levels and the boards confidence in our execution of our strategic priorities we recently announced a substantial increase to our quarterly dividend of per share to or i just want to close by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication to our customers and communities moving forward as i said we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow shareholder value as the economy normalizes and interest rates move higher and we realize the full potential of the combined pnc and bbva usa franchise the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 and with that ill turn it over to rob for a closer look at our results and then well take your questions robert q reilly chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thanks bill and good morning everyone our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on an average basis during the quarter loans increased by billion or investment securities grew billion or and federal reserve cash balances declined billion or reflecting higher securities and loan balances as well as lower borrowed funds deposit balances averaged billion and were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter our tangible book value was per common share as of march a decline linked quarter which was entirely driven by marktomarket adjustments in our securities and swap portfolios as a result of higher interest rates as a category institution we opted out of recognizing aoci and regulatory capital and as of march our cet1 ratio was estimated to be given our strong capital ratios we continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility and as bill just mentioned our board recently approved a increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock raising the dividend to per share additionally during the first quarter we completed share repurchases of billion or million shares slide shows our loans in more detail average loans increased billion linked quarter and on a spot basis loans grew billion or ppp loan balances continued to decline and impacted first quarter growth by approximately billion on both an average and spot basis looking at loan growth excluding the impact of ppp loans average loans increased billion or driven by billion of growth in commercial and industrial loans partially offset by a billion decline in commercial real estate balances and average consumer loans were stable linked quarter on a spot basis loans grew billion commercial loans grew billion driven by higher utilization as well as new production within corporate banking and business credit businesses notably in our cib segment the utilization rate increased basis points and our overall commitments were higher compared to yearend and consumer loans increased million as higher mortgage balances were partially offset by lower auto and credit card loans moving to slide average deposits of billion remained stable compared to the fourth quarter on the right you can see total deposits at period end were billion a decline of billion or linked quarter all of the decline was on the commercial side where deposits were billion lower primarily driven by seasonal cash deployments partially offsetting the commercial decline consumer deposits increased billion reflecting seasonally higher balances related to tax refund payments overall our rate paid on interestbearing deposits remained stable at basis points and importantly we remain core funded with a loantodeposit ratio of at the end of the first quarter slide details the change in our average securities and federal reserve balances weve maintained high levels of liquidity over the past year while opportunistically purchasing securities this trend continued into the first quarter as we added primarily us treasuries and agency rmbs as a result average security balances increased by or billion compared to the fourth quarter and now represent of interestearning assets slide highlights the composition of our highquality securities portfolio as well as the balance changes from yearend march during the first quarter we added to our portfolio with net purchases of approximately billion however the increase in rates during the first quarter resulted in higher net unrealized losses of approximately billion and accordingly our periodend balances remained relatively stable the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 to moderate the impact of rising rates on security values and correspondingly aoci we transferred approximately billion of securities from our availableforsale portfolio and to held to maturity at quarter end importantly fluctuations in aoci did not have an impact on our earnings however we are mindful of the aoc impact on tangible book value and well continue to evaluate potential opportunities to further ph transit turning to the income statement on slide as you can see first quarter reported eps was which included pretax integration costs of million excluding integration costs adjusted eps was during the first quarter integration costs reduced revenue by million and increased expenses by million first quarter revenue was down million or compared with the fourth quarter expenses declined million or linked quarter and excluding the impact of integration expenses non interest expense declined the first quarter provision recapture was million primarily reflecting the impact of improved covid19related economic conditions and our effective tax rate was so in total net income was billion in the first quarter now lets discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail slide details our revenue trends total revenue for the first quarter of billion declined million linked quarter net interest income of billion was down million or higher securities and loan balances as well as increased security yield were more than offset by a million decline in ppp revenue due to loan forgiveness activity and the impact of two fewer days in the quarter and net interest margin of was up basis point as we recently announced and effective for the first quarter we recategorized the presentation of our noninterest income and provided an update to the related guidance consistent with those revisions first quarter fee income was billion a decline of million or linked quarter looking at the detail of each revenue category asset management and brokerage fees decreased million or reflecting lower average equity markets capital marketsrelated fees declined million or driven by lower ma advisory fees mostly due to elevated fourth quarter transaction levels but also some delayed transaction activity in the first quarter card and cash management revenue decreased million or driven by seasonally lower consumer spending activity lending and deposit services was essentially stable linked quarter declining only million residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income was million lower primarily due to decreased commercial mortgage activity and finally other noninterest income declined million primarily due to lower private equityrelated revenue and once again compares to elevated fourth quarter levels turning to slide our first quarter expenses were down by million or linked quarter excluding the impact of integration expenses noninterest expense declined million or the majority of the decline was a lower personnel expense primarily reflecting the lower incentive compensation we remain deliberate around our expense management at yearend we achieved our objective to reduce bbva usas annual operating expense run rate by million and as we previously stated we have a goal to reduce costs by million in through our continuous improvement program and were confident well achieve our full year target as you know this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 our credit metrics are presented on slide nonperforming loans of billion decreased million or compared to december and continue to represent less than of total loans total delinquencies were billion on march a million decline from yearend reflecting lower consumer and commercial loan delinquencies the majority of these decreases resulted from our progress in resolving bbva usa conversion related administrative and operational delays net chargeoffs for loans and leases were million an increase of million linked quarter our annualized net chargeoffs to average loans continues to be historically low at basis points and during the first quarter we reduced our allowance for credit losses by approximately million and our reserves now total billion or of total loans in summary pnc reported a solid first quarter and were well positioned for the remainder of as we continue to realize the potential of our coasttocoast franchise in regard to our view of the overall economy we expect strong growth over the course of resulting in average gdp growth we also expect the fed to raise rates by an additional cumulative basis point through the remainder of this year to a range of to by yearend and all of this is consistent with the update in our recent 8k filing looking at the second quarter of compared to the first quarter of we expect average loan balances to be up to which includes a billion decline in ppp loans we expect net interest income to be up to we expect noninterest income to be up to which results in total revenue increasing to we expect total noninterest expense to be up to and we expect second quarter net chargeoffs to be between million and million considering our reported first quarter operating results second quarter expectations and current economic forecasts for the full year compared to the full year we expect average loan growth of approximately and spot loan growth of we expect total revenue growth to be to we expect expenses excluding integration expense to be up to and we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi want to see if you could give us a little bit more color on how youre thinking about the capital markets revenues front here obviously you saw a pretty good step down this quarter given the activity that the broader market saw clearly just wanted to get your thoughts on how we can expect to think about the remaining quarters if you think you could see an increase from here and if the capital markets outlook has impacted your full year revenue view is that baked in there as well thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure hey john its rob good morning so in regard to capital markets youll recall at the beginning of the year our expectations for capital markets was to be down approximately or so from levels just because the levels were so elevated the first quarter was slower than we expected even at those reduced levels but for the full year guide i have most of that back in there so most of what we expected to occur in the first quarter that didnt occur is still in the full year guidance so thats why were still to growth john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it all right thats helpful and then thanks rob and then secondly robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the deposit side just given the move in rates that were looking at here clearly a lot of focus on deposit flows for the spot balances you saw about a decline in your deposits there can you maybe give us a little bit of color of what youre seeing in terms of depositor behavior here near term is that more commercially oriented in terms of the deposits that you saw in terms of the decline and then can you talk about your betas that the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 you think youll see in the near term as rates rise and then further out after the first basis points fed hikes thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah okay this is rob again john so on the deposits in the quarter we saw a spot decline and all of that was on the commercial side which we see as largely seasonal consumer deposits on a spot basis were actually up reflecting tax refunds and some seasonality there so thats the story on the deposits for the full year in regard to the betas relative to what we expected at the beginning of the year we have increased our betas consistent with the increase in the fed rate hikes forecast along the lines of what we saw than the last cycle maybe a little bit less just because were working off such high levels very quiet as you pointed out very quiet on the first basis points or so but showing up if our rate forecast is correct showing up in the third and fourth quarter john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks if i could ask just one more thing on the loan side i know you mentioned the higher line utilization on the commercial side are you beginning to see capex plans drive loan demand and then lastly are you seeing any of the volume coming back from the capital markets back to the bank loan market yet on the commercial side william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think the utilization is part of reflects part of the slowdown on the capital market side and bonds clients continue to be active so yes some pickup in capex build in inventory the other thing were seeing beyond the utilization change i think we saw a similar percentage increase in just new dollars out sorry not percentage but notional amount increase of new dhe commitments out so some of its utilization some of its winning clients utilization driven by capital markets being a bit of disarray together with increased capex robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and higher inventory levels of course yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay great thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question is from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for question william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co so rob it was great to see you reiterate the full year revenue outlook and i think you sort of addressed this in response to the capital markets question previously but i was hoping broadly you could just kind of parse the guide between what comes from nii and what comes from fees i think days or so ago you guys have been thinking maybe midsingledigit allin growth for if i remember correctly but just given sort of the change in reporting and ph back others et cetera just curious to hear your thoughts robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure sure so to total for the full year compared to the beginning of the year net interest income is a bigger component of that because of the rate increases and the higher balances so were looking at that to be inside of that to the nii and the highteens and then on the core fee piece looking more towards flattish to maybe down lowsingle digits and most of the change there being on the mortgage outlook from the beginning of the year so most of our fee categories are tracking to what we expected for the full year including capital markets as i just mentioned but mortgage were off from what we thought at the beginning of the year because of rates so residential and commercial mortgage we expect it to be down lowsingle digits were now looking at maybe down or yearoveryear so thats where the fee change is largely resident r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect and you just captured my second question as well so thank you rob i appreciate it robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure operator operator instructions our next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc good morning william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so youre guiding for to revenue growth and to expense growth so youre guiding now for basis points of positive operating leverage im just curious are you tempted to spend some of that and invest more of that spread and i relate this im not telling you to do or not do im just theres always a tradeoff but i want to tie this back to your ceo letter bill where your first goal was to gain share in especially your new markets and your second goal was to improve share with your customers so i guess the concrete question is giving metrics to say what kind of share you like to improve by market and by corporate and consumer customer and to do that are you tempted to spend some of that excess of the revenue growth over expense growth thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks for the question mike in short we dont have to weve always been investing in our franchise so if you think about we talk about our new markets as i said in my comments they are largely staffed at this point and so if i think about our people spend were kind of where we need to be if i think about our technology spend weve been going hard at that for a number of years and were more in the place of what can we actually get done in a sequence timeline and we are about hey spend more money so youre not going to see increases against what we expected in that space so anyway short answer to your question is no we dont need to spend the money and not spending the money in no way detracts from the growth that i think were capable of mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc or in other words we are spending the money on investments and thats part of the guide william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah another way to put it yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so its baked in and can you put some numbers around your ceo letter like i said its your three goals gain share by your markets gain share by customers and technology at least for your first two goals where is the share today and where do you hope to get it to you have not given that before but itd be nice to know is it bigger than a bread box or what william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah no its a fair question i dont know that you were going to define share by share of ci loans in the market i think what we have to do and were working on mike is presentation of just progress in underpenetrated markets compared to what we execute in one of our mature markets and then tracking that for you i think thats the best metric so we look at loan balances we look at fees we look at percent of fees as a percentage of total revenues we look at calling volume we look at new clients all the things youd expect us to and we need to figure out and ill commit to you that we will we need to put out metrics so you can track it through time we do it internally mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then lastly as it relates to buybacks you had the book value regulatory capital dichotomy here which wins out when you think about buybacks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc not sure i follow the question mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc cet1 ratio thats fine thats good but your book value went down thats not as good do you still buy back the same amount of stock do you slow buyback do you ph do not buy back stock at all the aoci impact william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah yeah so if youre simply asking the question do we view our available capital based on the the answer to that is yes william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc correct mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then does that mean you continue to pace the buybacks or how do you think about that the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah were going to be in the market its obviously i think its more attractive today to buy back shares than it was towards the end of the year so were going to be in the market and i dont know what we probably said robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc no no thats right the answer is it is the regulatory capital that we look at mike and the current pace that weve been on we expect to continue the average quarterly pace we were a little bit more this past quarter mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator our next question is from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning bill and rob william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey bill robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc following up on your deposit beta expectations being a bit lower in this cycle given all the liquidity in the system you said on the last call that youd expect to see higher betas if the fed shrinks its balance sheet dramatically but that loan growth would be an offset to that maybe could you help square those two points for us and i guess just maybe discuss the risk that the pace the fed has communicated could lead to the higher deposit indiscernible risk the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so i mean there are two opposing forces right so when the fed shrinks its balance sheet which it will even if they let it run off theyre saying whatever that number is million its in a month or a quarter right i dont remember but it will pull deposits from the system at the same time when there is loan growth it puts deposits back into the system and the reason for that if you think about it is just leverage on the capital i assume everybody holds on a loan they borrow from us they deposit somewhere else it collectively builds deposits into the system collectively we think thats going to cause will cause deposit growth to slow but we actually think deposit growth is still going to be positive for the system and for us so again fed balance sheet shrinks but at the same time were going to see loan demand we expect to see loan demand we have seen loan demand at a pace that would generate deposits so were not particularly worried about that now what will happen of course is as the fed gets rates substantially higher betas are going to have to do a big catchup move because all of a sudden its going to matter interest rates are going to get back to a place where people start paying attention again now i dont know what that level is i dont know that weve ever come off of a base of zero and trying to play catchup the last time we thought about that the fed reversed course pretty quickly so were going to have to see how that plays out but i think deposits in the system will still be there we just wont see the same growth we have over the last couple of years bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it that makes sense and taking that thought process and going inside your outlook does that contemplate the possibility of maybe simply letting some of the liquidity that youre sitting on today outflow if necessary rather than paying up to keep it to fund loan growth william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well we havent had to pay up i mean as you see i think our average cost of fund stays basis points so theres some percentage of that on the corporate side in particular that will be that looks for direct substitutes from competitors or money market funds on a given day and we assume and in our forecast we assume that that will have very high if not betas of one and thats fine thats part of our funding model its embedded in our forecast and we never we dont consider those necessarily core deposits even though theyre core clients if that makes sense to you bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah if i can ask robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and thats basis points on core deposits the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc core borrowing is ph a lot higher bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay thank you thats helpful if i could ask on cre can you talk about the risk that tenants may remain good credits and continue to buy by their lease obligations through the end of their lease terms but ultimately not renew because they just dont need as much space william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look i think thats one of our fears i think were going to see that weakness in office properties flow through over a longer period of time and i think by the way thats very marketspecific so i would tell you for example i think in pittsburgh here were going to struggle with that and we dont have exposure interestingly we dont have a lot of exposure here but practically i think therell be less people in the buildings in pittsburgh and i think thats going to be the case in many metro areas around the country and yes i think thats going to cause lease rates to drop over time and yes i think thats going to impact office properties but were reserved for that have been watching that we pick our clients carefully and at this point we think most if not all of them have the wherewithal to make their way through that bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful thank you if i could squeeze in one last one bill you shared in the past a vision of giving consumers the ability to use zelle at the point of sale for retail payments can you update us on whether thats something that youd still support and how do you think about the risk of cannibalizing or that could cannibalize your debit and credit volumes william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look im not going to speak on behalf of ews the company simply because thats a collective decision from the ownership group of ews i think everybodys interest is to make payments easier to make payments be more fraudresistant and look to be able to make some return on payments we collectively look through all those things against the current rails and as the payment landscape changes well adapt with it we are going to start using zelle we and a few of the other ownership banks to allow purchase for services and for small business so it will get out there into the indiscernible merchant space just at this point not direct competitor to the card rails for a variety of reasons but not yet bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats super helpful thank you for taking my questions the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure bryan k gill a executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc next question please operator operator instructions our next question is from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi bill hi rob william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys i know you talked about the capital utilization rates going up possibly customers with capital expenditure but can you share with us where are they now and what would you consider to be a normal rate of capital utilization in our organization robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah and weve talked about this before gerard right now were in the low up from the high that we saw through the bulk of last year and normal just whatever normal is we might expect somewhere in the mid so were moving towards that not there yet gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and rob is there any difference have you discovered yet with the bbva customer that ci customer versus a legacy pnc customer robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc no its interesting on the commercial side we were talking about that this morning its very very similar in terms of the borrowing trades so there really is no difference in terms of the utilization of the lines theyre all up in sort of similar amounts the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then i know you mentioned in your remarks about transferring over some of the availableforsale securities i think it was billion into the held to maturity would they transfer it over at a discount and then will that discount accrete into your capital over time robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes yeah exactly william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and how big indiscernible yes go ahead robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and again it doesnt affect earnings gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc right right correct robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc its all going to pull we balance between the flexibility benefit of availableforsale versus the aoci component of or a benefit of held to maturity so well continue to look at that but it will run its course and again it doesnt affect earnings gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc right okay and just lastly i know you guys when you did the bbva transaction you were quite excited about the money transfer business between i believe it was maybe mexico and the us can you share with us any color on how is that going is it going as well as you expected have you been able to expand it william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no weve actually been really happy with it it has expanded and were currently looking its through several countries in latin america today and were actually looking at expanding that through relationships into other countries there and i think into europe although i am not certain about that its dependent on correspondent banking relationships in the receiving countries that are responsible for know your customer journey but no its a big business we actually white label it for others and were excited by it weve been its now mainstream on the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 our consumer apps and importantly were looking at some of that functionality to be tied into some of the things that were actually doing on the corporate side
