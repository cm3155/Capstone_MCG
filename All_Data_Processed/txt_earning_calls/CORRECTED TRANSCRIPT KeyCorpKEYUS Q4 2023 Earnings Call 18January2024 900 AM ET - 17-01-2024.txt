management discussion section abrupt start operator fourth quarter earnings call at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode later we will conduct a questionandanswer session operator instructions you will hear acknowledgement that your line has been placed in queue as a reminder this conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to chris gorman keycorps chairman and ceo please go ahead christopher m gorman chairman chief executive officer keycorp well thank you for joining us for keycorps fourth quarter earnings conference call joining me on the call today are clark khayat our chief financial officer and our chief risk officer darrin benhart who succeeded mark midkiff at the beginning of this year on slide you will find our statement on forwardlooking disclosures and certain financial measures including nongaap measures these statements cover our presentation materials and comments as well as the question andanswer segment of our call i am now moving to slide this morning we reported earnings of million or per share our results included million of aftertax expenses or per share from three items that clark will describe in more detail later for the year we reported eps of including impact from similar types of expenses fourth quarter closes out a challenging year for the industry and for key while our business fundamentals remained solid throughout the year we acknowledge that our balance sheet coming into the year was not wellpositioned for the rapid rise in interest rates that transpired we took a number of necessary steps as we moved through the year to enhance our balance sheet liquidity and capital position in preparation for potential changes in capital rules positioning ourselves to be a simpler smaller more profitable bank these actions also had some nearterm financial impacts as a result we missed our own expectations and yours however as we turn the page to i think it is really important to step back and recognize that key accomplished a number of positive things last year and as a result i am confident we have laid the groundwork as we move forward first and most importantly throughout the year the tremendous work and dedication of our teammates allowed us to continue to serve and support our clients through turbulent market conditions particularly in the first half of the year i am very thankful and proud of our teammates as they set aside the noise affecting our industry stepped up and continued to focus on executing on our strategic priorities and steadfastly serving our clients our focus on relationships continued to guide our balance sheet optimization efforts in we reduced loans by billion as we deemphasized credit only and other nonrelationship business despite this meaningful keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 reduction in lending we grew the number of relationship clients and households we serve across both our consumer and commercial businesses and grew deposits by billion in consumer we grew relationship households by with about twothirds of new relationships coming from younger demographics relationship deposits grew by commercial clients grew and commercial balances grew as a result of our continued focus on primacy about of our commercial deposits were from clients that had an operating account with key as of december as a result of our ability to raise relationship deposits while reducing loans we were able to meaningfully reduce our reliance on wholesale funding as the year progressed we also continued to raise significant capital for the benefit of our clients over billion in leveraging our unique distribution capabilities this proven and mature underwritetodistribute model is a key differentiator for us on expenses we made significant headway in simplifying and streamlining our businesses we exited certain capitalintensive and nonrelationship businesses such as vendor finance as we have previously done with indirect auto in november we announced a number of organizational changes including the reorganization and consolidation of our commercial banking and payments businesses we also realigned our real estate capital business with those of our institutional bank by aligning productbased teams to the clientfacing businesses they serve we are reducing overhead and complexity and creating a better client and prospect experience altogether these actions we took in impacted of our teammates additionally we continued to rationalize our nonbranch nonoperations center real estate footprint which has declined by over the past three years we do not take these decisions lightly but the reality is we need to make the difficult decisions today to earn the right to invest in the opportunities of tomorrow last years actions freed up over million on an annualized basis that we will redeploy to deliver value for our clients and drive future growth more broadly these actions combined with our ongoing disciplined expense management have enabled us to hold core expenses essentially flat at billion annually over the past two years and that is in spite of inflationary headwinds facing our industry on the capital front our riskweighted assets decreased by billion from the beginning of the year exceeding our fullyear optimization goal of billion concurrently we also increased our common equity tier numerator through net capital generation as a result our cet1 ratio increased by basis points to at yearend well above our targeted capital range of to our capital metrics including aoci also improved as lower interest rates and the continued pull to par over time of the unrealized losses in our investment portfolio drove over billion of improvement in our aoci over the past year tangible book value and tangible common equity ratios both improved meaningfully overall our capital position remains strong we are wellpositioned relative to our capital priorities and the currently proposed future capital requirements in fact we think were advantaged relative to other category banks given our underwritetodistribute model and the asset and capital light businesses that we have including a scaled wealth business with billion of assets under management also i want to comment on credit quality which i believe is the most important determinant of return on tangible common equity and shareholder value over time credit quality remains a clear strength of key our credit measures reflect the derisking we have done over the past decade and our distinctive underwritetodistribute model keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 net chargeoffs were basis points in the fourth quarter and basis points for the full year our npas which we firmly believe have very low loss content remain well below our historical averages the quality of our loan portfolio continues to serve us well with over half of our ci loans rated as investmentgrade or the equivalent our consumer clients have a weighted average fico score of approximately at origination as a reminder we have limited exposure to leveraged lending office loans and other highrisk categories two thirds of our commercial real estate exposure is multifamily of which approximately is in affordable housing which continues to be a significant and unmet need in this country as we move to i want to provide my key takeaways from the guidance that clark will walk you through in more detail shortly first we have a clearly defined net interest income opportunity moving forward as our short term swaps and treasuries reprice particularly in the second half of the year importantly we believe this can be achieved across a range of interest rate scenarios as a result of the significant work the team has done over the past year to improve our balance sheet resiliency we began to see some of that work pay off this quarter as our net interest income grew slightly relative to the third quarter our momentum makes me confident that we saw our net interest margin bottom out in the third quarter of secondly we have leading positions and meaningful growth opportunities across capital markets payments and wealth management we have consistently invested through the cycle in these differentiated fee businesses where we have targeted scale we continue to see good client engagement and our pipelines remain strong any normalization in the capital market represents an upside opportunity for key not only for fees but from the balance sheet management perspective that i spoke about earlier thirdly while the macroeconomic outlook remains highly uncertain based on our current assumptions we anticipate we will generate moderate positive operating leverage for the full year finally we continue to expect that we will outperform the industry this cycle with respect to credit credit quality remains one of our most significant strengths over the next several quarters we continue to expect to operate below our throughthe cycle net chargeoff range of basis points to basis points in summary we acknowledge was a challenging year difficult but necessary decisions were made and actions were taken but at this point we are nearly finished with that process our balance sheet is now appropriately sized for the environment in which we are operating we are better positioned for changes in interest rates up or down our demonstrated ability to manage and grow our deposits proves to be a strong foundation we are now in a position where we can be more opportunistic as we turn the page to before i turn it over to clark i want to take a moment to acknowledge last week we announced vern pattersons retirement from key as head of ir vern has led key through earnings releases and countless meetings with investors and other stakeholders i am so grateful vern to have worked alongside you i have tremendous appreciation vern for the great relationships you have throughout our industry and within our company so thank you again vern at the same time i am pleased to welcome brian mauney as our new director of investor relations with more than years of experience in our industry brian brings a depth and variety of experience and capabilities to the role while he has big shoes to fill i am very pleased that brian has joined the team with that i will turn it over to clark to provide more details on the results for the quarter clark keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 clark h i khayat chief financial officer keycorp thanks chris i would echo your comments on vern and a warm welcome to brian as well i am now on slide for the fourth quarter net income from continuing operations was per common share down from the prior quarter and down from last year our results this quarter were impacted by three items totaling per share first million from an fdic special assessment second million from an efficiencyrelated expense and third million from a pension settlement charge for a total of million pretax or million aftertax a breakdown of these items can be found in the last page of our slide presentation our fourth quarter results were generally consistent with the guidance we provided last month as expected we saw stability in the net interest income line this quarter and our net interest margin increased by basis points relative to the third quarter as we began to see some early benefits from our swap and treasury portfolios fees declined sequentially on the better end of the range we provided last month expense growth was primarily attributable to the three items i mentioned without these items expenses would have been relatively stable compared to the third quarter net chargeoffs as a percent of loans remain low at basis points and we added million to our allowance for credit losses to reflect some modest migration in the portfolio primarily in real estate and the stilluncertain macro outlook additionally as chris highlighted in his remarks our results reflect our focus on primacy and building relationships our improved capital position and our strong risk discipline turning to slide average loans for the quarter were billion down from both the yearago period and prior quarter the decline in average loans was primarily driven by a reduction in ci balances which were down from the prior quarter the reduction reflects our planned balance sheet optimization efforts which prioritize full relationships and deemphasize creditonly and nonrelationship business we reduced riskweighted assets by billion in the fourth quarter and as chris mentioned by approximately billion in the majority of the decline in riskweighted assets this quarter was from lower loan balances with some reduction in unused commitments also contributing we would expect modest rwa reductions in the first half of turning to slide keys longstanding commitment to primacy continues to deliver a stable diverse base of core deposits for funding despite a year of market volatility we grew periodend deposits yearoveryear by billion and average deposits were relatively stable compared to the yearago period and prior quarter on a sequential basis commercial deposits grew which we attribute primarily to seasonal build and consumer deposits grew the increase in commercial and consumer deposits was mostly offset by a billion decline in broker deposits on average as we continue to improve the quality of our funding mix by growing core relationship balances and reducing reliance on wholesale funding and broker deposits since the end of the first quarter we generated almost billion of liquidity by reducing loans and growing relationship deposits and reduced wholesale borrowings by billion our total cost of deposits was basis points in the fourth quarter and our cumulative deposit beta which includes all interestbearing deposits was since the fed began raising interest rates in line with our prior guidance of approaching by yearend keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 the higher rate environment continues to impact our deposit mix as our noninterestbearing deposits declined by sequentially to pressure on deposit pricing appears to be abating across the franchise though we expect some mix shift to continue as long as rates remain high turning to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was million for the fourth quarter down from the yearago period and up slightly from the prior quarter our net interest margin was for the fourth quarter compared to for the same period last year and for the fourth quarter the prior quarter yearoveryear net interest income and the net interest margin reflect the impact of higher interest rates as increased cost of interestbearing deposits and borrowings outpaced the benefit from higher earning asset yields additionally the balance sheet experienced a shift in funding mix from noninterestbearing deposits to higher cost interestbearing deposits relative to the third quarter the increase in net interest income and net interest margin were driven by actions taken to manage keys interest rate risk elevated levels of liquidity and an improved funding mix the increase was partly offset by higher interestbearing deposit costs which exceeded the benefit from higherearning asset yields while the planned reduction in loan balances adversely impacted net interest income sequentially it benefited keys net interest margin our net interest margin and net interest income continue to reflect the headwind from our shortdated treasuries and swaps which together reduced net interest income by million this quarter or by billion for the full year and lowered our net interest margin by basis points this quarter as previously discussed during our thirdquarter earnings call in october we terminated billion of received fixed cash flow swaps which were scheduled to mature throughout last quarter we said that net interest margin would bottom and it did throughout we would expect continued benefit from the maturities of our shortterm swaps and treasuries especially as more mature in the back half of the year moving to slide noninterest income was million for the fourth quarter of down million from the yearago period and down million from the third quarter the decrease in noninterest income from a year ago reflects a million decline in investment banking and debt placement fees driven by lower syndication fees and ma advisory additionally corporate services income declined million driven by lower customer derivatives trading revenue the decrease in noninterest income from the third quarter reflects a million decrease in other income primarily driven by a gain on a loan sale in the prior quarter im now on slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion up million from the yearago period and up million from last quarter as mentioned fourth quarter results reflect million of impact from fdic assessment efficiencyrelated expenses and pension settlement charge efficiencyrelated expenses included million related to severance and million of corporate real estate rationalization and other contract termination or renegotiation costs excluding these items expenses were relatively stable in the quarter and down compared to the yearago period we continue to proactively manage our expense base and simplify and streamline our business so we can continue to reinvest in all our businesses moving to slide overall credit quality and our related outlook remain solid for the fourth quarter net charge offs were million or basis points of average loans this compares to million in the prior quarter criticized outstandings to periodend loans increased basis points this quarter driven by movements in real keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 estate healthcare and consumer goods while nonperforming loans and criticized loans continue to move up off their historical lows we believe key is wellpositioned in terms of potential loss content over half of our npls are still current our provision for credit losses was million for the fourth quarter including million of reserve bill and our allowance for credit losses to periodend loans increased from to turning to slide we significantly increased our capital position throughout we ended the fourth quarter with common equity tier ratio of up basis points from the prior quarter and up basis points from the yearago period we remain focused on building capital in advance of newlyproposed capital rules while continuing to support relationship client activity and the return of capital as such we expect to stay above our current targeted range of to and do not expect to be buying back our stock in the nearterm our aoci position improved by billion this quarter the right side of this slide shows keys goforward expected reduction in our aoci mark based on two scenarios the forward curve is december which assumes six fomc rate cuts in and another scenario where rates remain at their current level in the forward curve scenario the aoci mark is expected to decline by approximately by the end of and by the end of which would provide approximately billion of capital built through that timeframe in the flat rate scenario we still achieve of that benefit between now and yearend said differently we still accrete billion of capital rates remain flat to current levels driven by maturities cash flow and time slide provides our outlook for relative to given uncertainty regarding eventual timing and extent of fed interest rate cuts in our guidance reflects outputs from a few potential scenarios ranging from the december forward curve which assumes six 25basis point cuts over the course of starting with an initial cut in march to a scenario more closely aligned with the feds dot plots which currently assumes three rate cuts we expect average loans to be down to mostly reflecting the actions we have already taken over the course of in other words the vast majority of the decline in average loans is a function of our reductions in and are reflected in our yearend balances we expect periodend loans at the end of to be relatively stable compared to the end of with some decline in the first half of the year offset by growth expected in the second half of we expect average deposits to be flat to down net interest income is expected to be down to mostly reflecting the lower fourth quarter exit rate relative to the first half of this equates to net interest income in that is up low single digits relative to our annualized fourth quarter exit rate ill provide more color on our net interest income outlook shortly we expect noninterest income to be up or better with upside of capital market activity normalizes and market levels and gdp trends remain constructive noninterest expense should be relatively stable at about billion as we realize the benefits from our efficiency actions we will continue to tightly manage our cost base including executing on additional opportunities to simplify and streamline our organization at the same time we will continue to protect and invest in our franchise including most importantly our people as chris mentioned our guidance suggests moderate positive operating leverage in driven by meaningful expansion in the second half of the year outpacing tough comparisons in the first half keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 for the year we expect credit quality to remain strong and net chargeoffs to continue to modestly increase to the basis points to basis point range still well below our overthecycle range of basis points to basis points our guidance for our gaap tax rate is approximately turning to slide given heightened investor focus on this topic we wanted to provide a little more granularity than we have in the past about the pacing of our net interest income opportunity as we move through hopefully by now youre familiar with our welldefined net interest income tailwind as the impact of our shortterm swaps roll off and treasuries mature especially in the back half of the ultimate opportunity remains largely unchanged at approximately million as a reminder the benefit increases each quarter as more of the swaps roll off and treasuries mature culminating in the full amount in the first quarter of so this all builds quarterbyquarter since the initial set of swaps came off the books in the first quarter of as we turn the page on we are nearing the halfway point of this journey since were now through three full quarters were sharing a threepart view first on the left in light gray are the three quarters of benefit weve already realized in total for that was approximately million of additional income the next four bars show the progression through as you see the value builds from each quarters tranche and accrues in the following quarter each bar represents the value for the quarter in other words in we expect to realize million of additional net interest income versus from these positions for we estimate the benefit to be approximately million in total which is the sum of the four quarterly bars this would represent an increase of more than million over the benefit received in which as previously mentioned was approximately million the final bar to the far right which has been the main focus of this discussion over the last year or so is the first quarter number this shows the benefit currently estimated for the quarter at approximately million from essentially the entire swap and shortterm treasury portfolios rolling off again this is incremental to and represents an annualized value of approximately million we believe the reinvestment of these fixedrate assets and swaps represents an outsized opportunity for key relative to our peers but its also important to remember that this is just one component that drives our net interest income outlook on slide we provide other key inputs and assumptions driving our nii outlook deposit betas balances and mix loan growth as well as seasonal factors putting these all together we expect our first quarter nii to be down to from the fourth quarter from there we expect to grow and start to accelerate in the second half of the year as the pace of swaps and us treasury maturities pick up meaningfully at nearly billion in aggregate per quarter from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of we expect our quarterly net interest income to grow plus and exit the year north of billion we would also expect the net interest margin to improve meaningfully to the to range by the end of this will put us on a strong trajectory as we enter with that i will now turn the call back to the operator for instructions for the qa portion of our call operator keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question will come from peter winter with da davidson one moment please mr winter i apologize here go ahead mr winter peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co all right great thank you clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp good morning peter peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co good morning clark a lot of good color on the net interest income with those slides but can you just go into a little bit more detail about the moving parts to the net interest income opportunity and maybe some other factors that impact your outlook and then secondly if you could talk about the quarterly nii progression you gave us the first quarter down but clearly its going to be a pretty meaningful impact uptick in the second half of the year clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure thanks peter and i appreciate the question i know this is a point of interest so let me provide a little bit of context for the guide and the trajectory and hopefully itll be helpful i think first maybe just start with the puts and takes which i think is the nature of your question there and im going to just categorize sort of the big movers i think one loan balances which again we guided kind of down to for the year asset yields im going to separate those from the swaps and treasuries because i just want to identify those separately deposit balances deposit pricing and funding costs and then the swaps and treasury portfolios so if you think about those as kind of five key levers on the guide if i go full year to full year which weve said down to the headwinds there are going to be the loan book so down to obviously thats going to impact nii deposits flat to down is a little bit of drag earning asset yields will drop yearoveryear as rates get cut and then deposit and funding costs will be up for the year as that fourth quarter kind of annualized number rolls through so those are the headwinds what we have coming our way is the swaps and the treasury portfolio as they mature throughout the year and then a better funding mix as we move through and become more and more reliant on deposits as we have this year so that sort of dimensionalizes what that yearoveryear look shapes out to be if you take the fourth quarter of annualized and you compare that to the full year were guiding up lowsingle digits there the biggest difference being that that funding cost that really is pretty flat from fourth quarter through which was not the case if you did the yearoveryear comparison and you still get the benefits of swaps and treasuries coming in during the year and a better funding mix keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 so you start to see that down to flip to up lowsingle digits we talked a little bit about the first quarter being down but let me just go fourth quarter to fourth quarter so i think that exit piece is important youre going to have deposits down a bit and earning asset yields down a bit going from fourth quarter of to fourth quarter of but you get a nice pickup in the quarterly swap and treasury portfolio our overall funding costs should be down in that quarter as rates have been cut throughout the year and then again you still have some benefits of funding mix and all that together we think is 10plus quartertoquarter nii growth so we think thats a nice pickup kind of end of yeartoend of year and then as you roll into you have that last billion tranche of treasuries and swaps maturing in the fourth quarter that accrues to the first quarter of so we start to hit the ground running really nicely with a very steep trajectory as we enter so ill stop there that was a lot of stuff but just trying to give you the components that are moving around peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co and just what are you expecting or assuming in terms of the forward curve and the timing of the rate cuts clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so our guide of to kind of incorporates a couple of different views kind of the range being the current forward down six with the first cut in march incorporating the lesser cuts on the three fed dot plots i think our general view is more aligned to four cuts with the first one middle of the year but were trying to provide guidance that i think incorporates all that and as you know when those cuts occur and the magnitude of that will will roll through to how we manage our deposit pricing obviously peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it thanks and then vern congratulations on the announcement its just been a pure pleasure working with you and the investment community will be missing you vernon patterson a outgoing director investor relations keycorp thank you peter operator next we go to the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler companies good morning everybody clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp hey good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler companies keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 thanks for all the moving pieces hey thanks for all the moving pieces in the nii color i guess clark youve discussed the sort of normalized margin i know we get sort of one one final uplift between fourth quarter of next year and first part of so the i think the way youve guided to fourth quarter of next year gets you a lot of the way there but certainly still some room left over is the normalized margin kind of still where what where youre bogeying and what has to happen to get us to do that sort of range clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah thanks scott so if you just go back and weve talked a little bit about this and its overly simplistic to be clear but if we took second third fourth quarter of and put the impact of swaps and treasuries back in the margin wed be million to million in those quarters which we think is pretty reflective of what weve got right now and thats with this sort of oddly longstanding downward sloping yield curve so i think that range as we get into feels like achievable and i think getting to that longer term probably needs us to have a more traditional upward sloping yield curve just that tends to accrue a little bit to all of our benefit on nim but i do think that 280plus million is pretty reflective of the underlying core ability of the business as it stands today r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler companies perfect thank you and then either clark or chris just the fee guidance feels like youre approaching with an abundance of conservatism regarding the capital markets outlook just curious if you could maybe put a finer point on what sort of recovery you are presuming what kind of upward leverage there might be if things do normalize christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure scott happy to address that so if you take what we just reported of a million specifically on the line you asked about investment banking and debt placement fees that would annualize at about million conversely if you took sort of the business and removed and said thats an outlier that traditional run rate is at least kind of million so i think we i think we have been conservative and thats why when we gave guidance weve said noninterest income up 5plus percent and then we put the qualifier upside if capital market capital markets activity normalizes we dont see it really normalizing until the back half of the year however its an interesting phenomenon when the 10year went above and then came back down as you can imagine people started to transact and so were seeing the beginning of it now but yes its a conservative number the other thing thats in that fee number is you saw that we had a stepdown with respect to our derivatives and hedging income a lot of that is tied to the balance sheet and as we go through and we get back to growing the balance sheet after going through our exercise on rwas youll see that come back as well r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler companies okay perfect thank you very much for that and then finally vern best wishes thank you so much for everything keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 vernon patterson a outgoing director investor relations keycorp thank you scott operator next we go to john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi first congratulations vern best of luck youre a legend and brian welcome looking forward to working with you again question on the a little bit more on the nii dynamics i wanted to get your thoughts on if we do see the cuts materialize as you had baked in your expectations what type of deposit beta you expect is achievable on the initial cuts and how would you think about accumulative on the way down and what is factored into your net interest income outlook in terms of that beta thanks christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah john so ill just ill start with that and then im going to flip it over to clark a couple of things to keep in mind we have a big commercial franchise and so of our deposits billion are commercial and of those about twothird are either indexed or indexlike now on the other side of the equation weve been pretty conservative in assuming that as the first cuts particularly if they arent steep cuts that well continue to get drift up on the consumer side also weve also forecasted just a bit of continued transition from interestbearing to noninterestbearing but we think weve sort of bottomed out there clark what would you add to that clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so so maybe broadly john on the nii guide we would expect some drift up particularly in the first quarter on deposit pricing just as rates stay high as chris said when the cuts come i think a good way to think about that commercial book because weve talked about the index nature of it as chris just referenced is sort of kind of an almost automatic midteens beta on a cut because of that how that index pulls through so the question really is going to be what happens to the consumer book and how quickly can we move that i think a 25basis point cut with a kind of long waiting period does it provide a lot of opportunity to reduce if we start to see bigger cuts or cuts sooner or more rapid cuts that allows us to deploy those price reductions into the book so right now as i said were really looking at kind of our view is more like the four cuts starting in the middle of the year we think well probably have some stabilization maybe a little a bit of consumer drift through that time period and then well start to proactively move rates down but given the timeframe in hard to say exactly what the beta will be on the way down for the year but its really going to pick up in keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 well see some benefit in but on the consumer book its just going to lag a little bit and that and candidly thats just going to be as much a competitive a function of competitive environment as anything else but we are taking some actions in the consumer book today to prepare for cuts were not cutting rates but preparing our franchise to be ready for that and i think well be very proactive when that opportunity shows up christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp and frankly all markets are not the same were out there experimenting with a few things as we speak john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks for that and then separately on the credit front can you give us a little bit more color on the increase in nonperformers in the quarter and maybe a little more color on the criticized asset increase and i know your commercial real estate npl ratio now is what was that last quarter was that the biggest increase in the nonperformers thanks clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah ill come back to you on the increase from third quarter i dont have that right in front of me but on your other points the npa uptick really is a small list of identified credits most of which we feel very good about the loss content so it is a pickup in the ratio but we dont think thats a loss driver on criticized look that is a function of continued higher rates putting some stress on what id call kind of the first order rating variable around debt service coverage so that does drive rating migration in our book that rating migration does pull through to criticize and classified but when you get underneath that metric and you look at things like clients willingness to build the interest reserve and the value of the collateral given we tend to underwrite at or lower cltvs out of the gate we just dont see a lot of lost content there john pancari q analyst evercore isi indiscernible just one clarification so it was primarily ci related in terms of the npa increase or cre christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp there were there were three specific credits one of which was real estate john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thanks chris christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure operator next we go to the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning i wanted to extend my best to vern as well and i just wanted to say we really appreciate all your help over the years so a big thank you and then on my question i think you said you still expect some modest rwa reduction in the first half of is that all coming from the loan book and as we think about the long end of the curve staying here or even moving lower you should have a lot more clarity on accreting that aoci back over time so what would you need to start leaning into loan growth a little or deploying capital elsewhere christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure so were about where we need to be in terms of going through our whole portfolio as we went through and were looking and focused on rwas really was sort of in three buckets and we actually went accountbyaccount and ive often said that on a riskadjusted basis standalone credit properly graded cant return its cost of capital and so we were extremely prescriptive across the entire firm of going through that on top of that we exited some businesses like vendor finance that by the way is a creditonly business and then on top of that there were certain areas where we were conservative in terms of our capital treatment where we could actually reduce rwas without in fact having any impact on nii that process is really over when i say the process is over we will continue obviously to look through our portfolio but in terms of really seeing the stepdown in rwas as you saw last year billion thats behind us and so as we look forward clark talked about sort of the lag from the starting point on loan growth but as you know we have the ability to generate loan growth here at key weve got a long history of that well be back kind of focused on serving our clients now having said that i personally have a view everyone has sort of coalesced around the soft landing i think inflation is still pretty sticky i think there is a bunch of drivers out there were managing the business for a short recession in and obviously that goes into our thinking because if you think about working capital in the context of a shrinking economy that shrinks some loan demand the other thing that we have to grow through and this is by design is were going to have billion of runoff in our consumer business i hope that helps kind of on the puts and takes when there is business to be done from a loan perspective i am confident that we can get it clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp the only other thing id add manan is just just to reground everybody in the averagetoaverage move so billion of average in ending point billion so most of that decline in loans happened last year were pulling that through there may be a little bit more as we said in the first quarter maybe into the second quarter as some of that nonrelationship business continues to move out but well see the buildback through the course of the year and expect the ending of to be relatively stable with where we exit so well see a rebound and to chriss point if there is less softness in the economy and more opportunity then well lean into that opportunity manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 thats very helpful and then for my followup as we look out into there is a lot of puts and takes here on the nii side but whats the most optimal rate environment for key is it six rate cuts and then an upward sloping yield curve is that the most optimal environment or would you rather see a higher short end rate and a flatter yield curve clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp i think look i think an upward sloping yield curve benefits the business broadly i am not as concerned at the moment about four cuts or six cuts as we move through the year while were liabilitysensitive today as we move through the year and swaps and treasury portfolios burn off were going to slightly become more asset sensitive naturally so we really want to be neutral and able to operate in any of those environments but if i had my choice broadly i think an upward sloping yield curve is always a valuable place for us to be in this business manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp thank you operator and our next question is from erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning so i apologize one more question on net interest income i think the stock is a little bit soft today because consensus was expecting quarterly positive progression on the net interest margin given the fixed rate opportunity and i am just wondering in context of the modest rwa reductions clark that youre youre forecasting or youre telling us its happening for the first half of the year how much of that is impacting the nii trajectory and are those rwas being reduced through credit link notes that could impact the net interest income and then as a followup to that as we think past the first half of the year do you feel like weve moved going back to what chris has said the process is over is that a cleaner way to think about where your balance sheet is or has to be relative to where you think the capital could be in the second half of the year in other words there wont be any more wholesale actions that can impact this nii and nim trajectory clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so thank you erika good good question as always so the decline in the first half again is the continuation of some actions we took to manage rwas last year so again relationship nonrelationship and creditonly clients coming down we do we dont have anything factored in at the moment around rwa management related to credit link notes as you and i have talked about before were doing our homework to understand those opportunities but its not part of the guidance at the moment really it would be that loan reduction and that will put a little bit of pressure on first quarter as will the fact that rates remain high in the first quarter under almost any cutting scenario and well have a little bit of beta drift keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 so thats really the first quarter pressure but i think your point about kind of a clean balance sheet entering the second half is the right one and i think again were suggesting kind of a tepid recession kind of midtolate year if that doesnt come through and we see a more constructive economic environment i think there is some opportunity to grow loans but i do think as we progress through the year youll see nim expand youll see nii grow nicely and youll see the balance sheet i think on the right trajectory erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my second question is a bit of a twoparter as i am trying to squeeze it in clark i think when i first met you i was very impressed by how you you were so good at understanding where your funding needs and funding sources so my question for you is are these twothirds of your commercial deposits in commercial are they truly indexed on the way down right theres a a few regional banks have warned us that theyre indexed on the way up and perhaps more negotiated on the way down and i guess the other question is that is it possible to break down on slide on your maturity schedule what would the treasurys component be and the swap component only because obviously there is a lot of debate on whether or not the cuts in the curve will happen which clearly impacts some of the math behind the swaps clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yes so the second one erika is easy weve i think weve provided that breakout before well well deliver it thats thats not a problem at all on the first i think look its a fair point because not all of those commercial deposits are contractually indexed so i think thats the right question there is always a little bit of its easy to negotiate with a client when youre giving them rate and its a little bit harder when youre taking it away but i would say our view is well it may not perfectly pull through we have spent a lot of time with these clients weve been in front of them probably more than we would care to admit over the last year but in a way that i think we have a good understanding of how those dynamics would work and we expect that the components of what we think are indexed will come through and just as a reminder the when we say indexed its not all indexed so there is a range of that so bringing a client down who is indexed kind of doesnt feel as challenging to negotiate than somebody who is coming down at ph client and so the book the book is pretty broadly distributed across to and were going to actively engage those clients to make sure we can manage the book appropriately erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you and yes vern vernon patterson a outgoing director investor relations keycorp thanks erika operator next we move to the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 hi just a quick clarification the fee guidance of you walked through a lot of detail ph around investment banking if that assumes the annualized level the kind of up million more normal level or somewhere in between thank you clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp its a little bit in between matt probably a little more leaning toward the higher number but we do think if markets kind of fully normalized wed see a little bit upside so its better than the annualized fourth quarter not quite all the way to what we would think is normal operation matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator next we move on to the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi chris hi clark christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc chris one of the interesting developments over the last to maybe months has been the increased competition from the private credit lenders into the commercial space can you share with us obviously you guys are strong big regional lender in the ci space what are you guys seeing from competition from those non depository lenders and the second if any of them are your customers how do you balance their needs with at the same time competing against them for lending christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure its a great question and its developing quickly so principally they are customers of ours and let me explain what i mean by that as you all know we distribute of the capital we raise so we are distributing all the time a lot of paper to these private debt funds and its an important part of our underwritetodistribute model as weve said many times that for banks a standalone properlygraded credit cant return its cost of capital that is not the situation for the private debt funds they have the benefit of leverageonleverage we have to be a relationship bank we have to we have to be able to provide all of the payments capabilities all of the capital markets capabilities and thats actually an opportunity for us because i think what youll see is as keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 these private debt funds continue to grow theyll need to partner with banks and theyll want to partner with banks that have sophisticated capabilities around things like payments and capital markets but dont necessarily want to hold on a riskadjusted basis paper that doesnt return that doesnt hurdle so i look at it frankly as an opportunity for us i think were wellpositioned for that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then coming back to credit you mentioned obviously you have minimal or very low exposure to office space which is great in this environment and then you have the multifamily exposure but i think you said was in lowcost housing can you share with us what are you guys seeing in some of the markets where theres been rapid buildup of not necessarily lowcost housing or subsidized housing but normal housing in the multifamily are you seeing issues in that subsegment of the multifamily market or do you not have much exposure to those markets that are growing rapidly christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp well we dont have a lot of exposure because youll remember gerard we exited a lot of these what we call gateway cities probably five years ago based on affordability based on cap rates but we do have a fair amount of insight in that we have this thirdparty commercial loan servicing business and we are the named special servicer on over billion of loans and in that area of whats in active special servicing which is really what didnt workout is office but the fastestgrowing segment over the last quarter was in fact multifamily in some of these gateway cities so were not seeing it in our portfolio because its not an area of focus but we are picking it up through the reconnaissance we get through our thirdparty commercial loan servicing business just one little addon to that that i think the group might find interesting that i did when i was talking to the leaders there actually what is in special servicing is down we had a record year in as you can imagine what is in active special servicing actually ticked down which i think is just an interesting data point for all of us that kind of follow the market gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great chris thank you and vern a really good luck on your retirement and i do want to point out that i have on my credenza the investor conference book from september of when we had the infamous elvis impersonator entertain us that night so thank you those are great memories vern clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp well fortunately i wasnt around for that but im sure vern will be happy to sign it for you gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator next we go to the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well chris one of your one of your competitors ceo has said scale has never been more important and that competitor is larger than you are and so pulling back the lens how do you think about scale and how its changed over the past year and i have two specific questions before you give that broader answer what percent of the value of commercial relationship is from the deposits thats a specific number and then what percent of the revenues that you get from your typical commercial relationship is feebased versus lendingbased because i think that gets to the larger value proposition of key christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp for sure well let me let me start with the larger question first and then well talk a bit about the mix of spread income to fee income which i do think by the way let me just start there i think thats a great barometer as you know throughout key were fee income which for a category iv bank is at the high end of the spectrum as we look at businesses like our institutional bank the split there in some areas is as high as fees spread and it varies depending on the business because some businesses are more capitalintensive than others but that is one of the metrics we look at to see what kind of penetration were getting as it relates to scale and i think its a really good and important question on one hand theres no question that if you have to carry more capital and capital is more expensive that would put more of a premium on scale than before and the same would go for things like cyber so on the margin yes scale would be probably more important today than it was months ago having said that i do not think scale is the answer for a bank like key and i say that because when you have competitors that are times as big as you are the question really is what is scale and as you know what weve decided to do is focus on targeted scale to be really really relevant to the customers that we try to be relevant to were certainly not trying to compete in the same manner that the largest banks they have a nice business model it works for them but thats not a business model mike that that were that were executing at all does that answer your question mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah i mean i think this kind of goes to the stickiness of corporate deposits and how thats changed over the past year and you answered the question of fees how much of the value of your commercial relationship is depositdriven and you have the cash and treasury management and other services that you provide corporate keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 treasurers is that still sticky and is that like of the value as some have said and then just another followup is what does all your thinking mean about acquisitions if and when generalized securities losses go down for you and the targets are you looking to be in that game or not christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp well on the acquisition front as you know weve had a lot of success buying niche businesses and successfully integrating them which i dont think a lot of large companies forget about banking have had a lot of success doing we are still because of our targeted scale focus we are still interested in doing that were always building these pods of people and actually looking for small organizations in terms of looking mike at depositories thats not something were spending any time doing i think when you look at the landscape one i think the up with the regulatory slash approval process i think theres a lot of questions around that obviously the pull to par any unrealized losses become realized losses in the event of an acquisition and then secondly theres just so much uncertainty in the marketplace i think one would have a lot of questions about what is actually in the book of the company that youre acquiring so thats not something im spending a lot of time on getting back to your question theres no question that theres a significant value in the deposits and for example thats one of the reasons were really focused this year on building out our business banking business because thats a business thats very depositcentric and as you think about going forward theres a lot of value in there i dont have off the top of my head what percentage is the contribution i think its around well circle back to you i think its about of the value is in the payments and deposits but we will circle back to you and confirm that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp thank you mike operator next we go to steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning steve clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and i want to start out vern like everybody else said almost everybody on the call congratulations youre really one of a kind so were going to miss you in terms of my question so first i want to go back clark to your response to scottie siefers earlier question on where nim could go you said to like in a more normal environment whatever the hell that is right we havent seen that in years but you guys used to do to is there something its really a twopart question one is there something structural maybe the way youre using swaps today that theres a lower ceiling on nim like to is gone maybe is like upper end and then secondly assuming this benefit accrues through so its up for a good now and maybe for chris how do you think about this like nims expanding pretty nicely in assuming we have a more normal curve is that the time you now step up the pace of investment youve been cutting expenses forever is that the time where you step up or do you let that benefit fall to the bottom line thats the questions clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so a couple a couple of questions in there and thank you for acknowledging no normal environment has existed but the structural piece i would say steve relative to key over the last years but particularly going into the crisis would be i think the loan book profile is quite a bit different so if you think about the quality of the borrowers the of cib investment grade the structural differences in our cre portfolio the largely residential real estate collateralized kind of super prime consumer all of those things kind of lean you toward a little bit lower base nii just because of the quality of that portfolio christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp and clark i would add card as well clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp i think i mean yeah card which we have but its highly transactorbased versus balancebased now given that you would expect credit losses to be better and then we think they will be certainly better than us historically but you would expect better on a relative basis and your other question would be okay how do you monetize those clients to make sure that youre getting the right returns and getting business on it we think we do that really well in the commercial business we think were doing that better and better as you go down market and commercial with things like payments and we think were getting much better on wealth and building the wealth business in the consumer space so we think were building those capabilities and have the opportunity to do that but i do think if you look back over time theres probably a base structural nature of nii thats a little bit lower given the quality of the portfolio and thats very intentional youve heard chris talk about that at length we have been tight on expenses weve been doing that largely to maintain our ability to invest and the short answer is hard to predict exactly what we do i think its a function of how much expansion do we see how much investment capacity does that create and frankly how much high keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 quality investments are there in front of us our first investments are always going to be in good clients and our people and then in this world youve got to continue to invest in technology i actually think on an infrastructure basis weve done a really good job over that on that over the last decade and well continue to do that but were going to continue to make sure that we can invest and build the franchise the way we need to be competitive christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp and from a organic growth perspective steve we obviously were doing our typical level of investment last year but where youll see us lean in youll see us lean into our unique integrated corporate and investment bank where weve had a lot of success recruiting people i mentioned earlier our billion of aum we think that platform is eminently leverageable well be investing in that i mentioned also payments and then lastly i also mentioned business banking those are the areas where youll see us leaning in from an investment perspective steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay if i can ask one other question so chris its interesting to hear youre so bullish on credit and i say that because if you listen to every other person they have on cnbc all they point to is all this pressure coming on commercial real estate to a regional bank like you guys can you just say to the investors that are on the line right now whats happening i mean youve had commercial real estate loans come up for renewal in the fourth quarter i know you have a large office portfolio but im sure some of them came up for renewal whats happening are you able to renew because the ltv like you said was you put a higher cap rate theyre getting renewed theres a perception that its nothing more than ph extended pretend and youre just the banks are just kicking the can down the road so id love to hear your view on whats now happening as these loans are coming up for renewal thanks christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure well and youve got to look backwards a bit and first of all we had outsized losses in real estate during the financial crisis and we said wed never do that again and we literally ripped the business down to the studs and rebuilt it and rebuilt it around an underwritetodistribute model so fannie freddie fha the life companies the cmbs market we also said were only going to finance the best real estate people in the right sectors in the right geographies and so weve been very very prescriptive so we distributed a bunch of our total loan book is in real estate whats happening on the ground is because of the people that were financing when we go through the math and because of the rise in interest rates because they qualify then as a criticized loan we go to them and we ask them for an interest reserve and they give it to us so what is going on on the ground with us im not sure its representative of the whole market but its been its the work that we did starting years ago that really has put us in the position that were in now steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it maybe unique but still nonetheless not the overhang that maybe some are being led to believe okay keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp indeed steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my questions christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure steve clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp thanks steve operator next we go to ken usdin with jeffries please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks sorry for the late question here congrats to both vern and brian just one on expenses and efficiency you guys did a great job last year taking the actions to continue to head towards stableish expenses im just wondering how much more flex you have in there in terms of things you can continue to do to offset the expected investments that you continue to talk about and need to make and can you keep that stable trajectory as you look further out thanks christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp thanks for the question ken whenever im talking to our team i tell everybody were all risk managers were all responsible for revenue and were all responsible for managing expenses were spending as i mentioned about billion a quarter there are always things that we can do better to create the raw material to continue to invest and in our business unfortunately the real cost is people and if you look pointtopoint we have less people on the team today than we did a year ago and obviously that will pull through its also you get a you also get a big pickup when you exit businesses like we did in vendor finance where you can take out front middle and back office so we did a lot of the heavy lifting ken last year i dont see that level of heavy lifting continuing but its something that we just have to stay after every single day thanks for the question operator and next we go to a question from bill carcache please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning chris and clark christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc i was hoping you could give some color on the sentiment youre hearing from your clients for the soft landing scenario to play out it seems like we would need to see the disinflation trends not just continue from here but there would also need to be a reacceleration in loan growth and i guess maybe first do you agree with that and if so how likely do you think we are to see loan growth reacceleration from here based on what youre seeing and hearing from your clients christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp i think it goes back to it goes back to inflation is and is inflation really under control and if it isnt what actions will the fed be required to take or not take given what the forwards are saying in order to get inflation under control right now our customers are in good shape as you know the job market is in good shape interesting data point and one of the reasons i think inflation is going to be stickier than people think our noninterest bearing customers today have more dollars in their account than they did prepandemic so i just feel like so i think thats a risk and so if we get if we get a soft landing i think therell be opportunities for loan growth weve in our planning were assuming a short recession in for all the reasons i just described bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood very good thank you for taking my question thats very helpful and let me also add my congratulations vern all the best and looking forward to working with you as well brian thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen well now be turning the conference back to chris gorman for closing remarks christopher m gorman chairman chief executive officer keycorp again we thank you for
