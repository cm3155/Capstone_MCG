m young chief financial officer capital one financial corp thanks jeff and good afternoon everyone ill start on slide of tonights presentation in the second quarter capital one earned billion or per diluted common share on a linkedquarter basis periodend loans grew and average loans grew largely driven by growth across our domestic card and commercial businesses in the linkedquarter revenue increased largely driven by growth in net interest income the loan growth i just described and nim expansion both contributed to the increase in net interest income i will touch on the nim more in a moment capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 noninterest expense grew in the quarter driven by an increase in operating expenses higher head count and the associated compensation costs were the single biggest driver of the linkedquarter increase in addition to compensation expenses the collective impact of a number of smaller items also drove up q3 expenses provision expense in the quarter was billion driven by net chargeoffs of million and a million allowance build turning to slide i will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail the total companys million allowance build in the quarter brings our allowance balance up to billion as of september our total company coverage ratio increased basis points to turning to slide ill discuss the allowance and coverage across each of our business segments as you can see in the graph our allowance coverage ratio increased modestly in each of our segments in our domestic card business the allowance balance increased million bringing our coverage ratio to the billion of loan growth in the quarter drove the majority of the allowance build the impact of continued normalization and a modestly worse corporate economic outlook were partially offset by the release of a portion of our qualitative factors linked to uncertainty in the economy in our consumer banking segment the allowance balance increased by million driving a basis point increase in coverage to the modestly worse corporate economic outlook i just mentioned and expectations of credit normalization drove the allowance builds and finally the allowance increased by million in our commercial business resulting in a basis point increase in coverage to a combination of the modestly worsening corporate economic outlook an uptick in criticized loans and loan growth drove the allowance build turning to page ill discuss liquidity you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was well above the regulatory requirement total liquidity reserves were roughly flat at about billion as our liquidity reserves have largely normalized to prepandemic levels our securities portfolio declined by about billion driven by a combination of the decline in market value from rising rates and the continued planned runoff of the outsized portfolio we built during the pandemic the decrease in our securities portfolio was primarily offset by higher cash and cash equivalents turning to page ill cover our net interest margin net interest income in the quarter was billion up from the yearago quarter and up from last quarter our net interest margin was in the third quarter basis points higher than the yearago quarter and basis points higher than last quarter the basis point linked quarter increase in nim was driven roughly equally by three factors first an extra day to recognize income in the quarter second a continued balance sheet shift towards card away from loweryielding assets and third the net benefit of the higher yield of assets relative to higher funding costs turning to slide i will end by discussing our capital position our preliminary common equity tier capital ratio was at the end of the third quarter up about basis points relative to last quarter the billion of net income in the quarter was mostly offset by growth in riskweighted assets dividends and a little over million in share repurchases we continue to estimate that our longerterm cet1 capital need is around and with that i will turn the call over to rich rich capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 richard d fairbank chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks andrew and good evening everyone ill begin on slide with third quarter results in our credit card business yearoveryear growth in purchase volume and loans coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on slide in the third quarter strong yearoveryear growth in every top line metric continued in our domestic card business purchase volume for the third quarter was up yearoveryear and up compared to the third quarter of ending loan balances increased billion or about yearoveryear ending loans grew from the sequential quarter and revenue was up yearoveryear driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin strong credit results continued in the quarter both the chargeoff rate and the delinquency rate are well below prepandemic levels and continue to normalize the domestic card chargeoff rate for the quarter was up basis points yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end was basis points above the prior year on a linkedquarter basis the chargeoff rate was down basis points the delinquency rate was up basis points from the linkedquarter noninterest expense was up from the third quarter of including an increase in marketing total company marketing expense was million in the quarter our choices in domestic card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends in our domestic card business we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth were keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks were seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in purchase volume new accounts and loans across our domestic card business and strong momentum in our decadelong focus on heavy spenders continued in the third quarter heavy spender marketing includes early spend bonuses driven by continued strong account growth and spending as well as investments in franchise enhancements like our travel portal and airport lounges in the third quarter our marketing continued to drive strong growth in heavy spender accounts and strong engagement and spend behaviors with both new and existing customers our decadelong quest to build our heavy spender franchise has brought with it significantly increased levels of marketing but the sustained revenue credit resilience and capital benefits of this enduring franchise are compelling and theyre growing slide shows third quarter results for our consumer banking business in the third quarter we continued to pull back on growth in auto in response to competitive pricing dynamics many auto lenders appear to have reflected rising interest rates in their marginal pricing decisions but others have not and they have gained market share and pressured industry margins we chose to pull back on auto originations which declined yearoveryear and from the linkedquarter driven by the decline in originations consumer banking loan growth is slower than previous quarters third quarter ending loans grew to the yearago quarter on a linkedquarter basis ending loans were essentially flat third quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up yearoveryear consumer banking deposits were flat compared to the sequential quarter capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 consumer banking revenue was up yearoveryear as growth in auto loans was partially offset by the year overyear decline in auto margins and the effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees noninterest expense was up compared to the third quarter of driven by continuing investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses and the increased marketing for our digital national bank the auto chargeoff rate and delinquency rate continued to normalize in the third quarter the chargeoff rate for the third quarter was up basis points yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points yearoveryear on a linkedquarter basis the chargeoff rate was up basis points and the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points slide shows third quarter results for our commercial banking business third quarter ending loan balances were up from the sequential quarter driven by growth in selected industry specialties average loans were up in the quarter ending deposits were up from the second quarter average deposits were down in the quarter third quarter revenue was up from the linked quarter noninterest expense was also up commercial banking credit remained strong in the third quarter the commercial banking annualized chargeoff rate was basis points the criticized performing loan rate was and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was in closing we continued to drive strong growth in card revenue purchase volume and loans in the third quarter loan growth in our consumer banking business was slower compared to previous quarters as we pulled back on auto originations and our commercial banking business posted another quarter of strong revenue growth credit results remain strong across our businesses chargeoff rates and delinquency rates are below prepandemic levels and credit continues to normalize we typically see an increase in operating expense over the second half of any year this year the timing of some of our investment opportunities drove a larger than usual third quarter increase in operating expense which was up from the second quarter we expect that this years linkedquarter increase in fourth quarter operating expense will be smaller than the approximately linkedquarter increase weve seen on average over the last five years turning to operating efficiency ratio relative to fullyear we expect annual operating efficiency ratio to be roughly flat in and modestly down in as usual our operating expense and efficiency expectations exclude any potential adjusting items pulling way up were in a strong position to deliver compelling longterm shareholder value as modern digital technology continues to transform banking we continue to see opportunities to lean into marketing and resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities our growth opportunities are enhanced by our digital transformation we continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty powered by our modern digital technology were continuously improving our proprietary underwriting marketing and product capabilities and were managing capital prudently to put ourselves in a position to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice president global finance capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 thank you rich well now start the qa session remember as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup if you have any additional followup questions after the qa session investor relations team will be available after the call liz please start the qa question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of kevin barker with piper sandler your line is now open kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon thanks for taking my questions i appreciate the comments around credit and how were still in a normalization back to prepandemic levels particularly in some key asset classes but at what point do you say that the yearoveryear growth rate and delinquency rates is too fast relative to what you would expect for a typical normalization richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah kevin so thank you for your question let me just pull up and just comment on normalization first of all the context of where we are because consumer credit remains strong as you can see from the metrics and our domestic card losses in the third quarter were about half of prepandemic levels and our delinquencies are and weve often said this unmistakably normalizing but right now they remain about below prepandemic level there is not a certain point where we dont look out there and say if the rate of growth of delinquencies exceeds a certain number then we will pull back but let me comment first of all that weve said for a long time kevin and i know you know this that normalization is bound to happen it would be shocking if it didnt happen and weve been talking for a bunch of quarters now saying it started you needed a magnifying glass to see it and we talked about that and now of course you can see it in the numbers and its definitely normalizing the rate at which its normalizing is frankly more gradual than we generally expected but we didnt really have a road map to know exactly what pace it would normalize we just believe so strongly that it would so what we do with rather than say theres a certain number that would lead us to make a certain decision we of course look at this with whats happening with every segment and micro segment of our business and how its performing we look for starters at the back book and that is normalizing as well frankly like everything here more gradually than expected but still the back book is clearly normalizing as well we then look for other patterns of normalization and here are some of the patterns that we see kevin its more pronounced in the front book of new originations than in the existing back book and by the way it would be that would be shocking if it werent the case because of the time in our history front books normalize faster during periods of change but we confirm again that front books are normalizing faster it also seems that normalization is more pronounced at the lower end of the market and of course those are the populations that improve more and more quickly earlier in the pandemic lower income consumers may also be feeling more pressure from inflation so these trends shouldnt be surprising but at the at kind of a high level capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 what we see is very normal and is and basically the way were leaning into the marketplace is very consistent with what weve been saying for a bunch of quarters now but what we do at the micro level at the segment level and the subsegment level is look at the various metrics both on the back book and on the front book to see what the patterns are and were comfortable with what we see in terms of front book vintage curves as a general point and across a vast majority of all the segments that we operate in we have around the edges weve done a little bit of dialing back in particular pockets where metrics are normalizing a little bit faster we also sort of pull up and say what are the kinds of what are the risks that we would expect to see at a time like this with orthogonal looks through our book and we brainstorm on what all the risk we could see we go hunt for them and in a couple of places we have seen effects that caused a little bit of trimming around the edges but the collective amount of trimming in the card business is pretty small relative to the overall scale of our growth as you know the in the auto business we have pulled back at the very same time were leaning into the card business were pulling back in the auto business but maybe ill save that for another question kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just a followup i mean is there anything i appreciate all the look at the granular side of the business and what you see within your book on a very micro level but from a macro level is there anything that youd look at that would make you pulled back that may not be apparent at the micro level in particular i think you made some prepared remarks about changes in the corporate outlook in particular thank you richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp sorry the changes in the corporate can you repeat that last part changes in corporate outlook kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co i believe in your prepared remarks you said there were some changes in the corporate outlook that may have affected part of your allowance was there anything in particular that stood out that may cause you to pull back when you think about the macroeconomic outlook richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp well the we of course at the whole time were doing the micro examination of one segment at a time we are looking at the macro trends its really striking the level of inflation and as ive often said we collectively everybody on this call none of us and nobody across the business world has really lived something like this since the early so were especially looking for effects that might be different this time kevin with respect to inflation and the how that can play out but so were always on the lookout but the net impression i would want to leave here is very much the same impression that ive left with you the last many quarters here jeff norris a senior vice president global finance capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 next question please operator our next question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs your line is now open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening everyone andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey ryan richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so maybe just to start on the cost and efficiency side rich so its good to hear that youll be back on the efficiency improvement journey next year so i guess just a twopart question you talked about opex ramping less in the fourth quarter but just given the level of marketing spend and how the spend has shifted under the hood in terms of moving up market should we expect to see less than historical seasonality on the marketing side and then second just can you help us with the magnitude of the efficiency improvement into next year and what is actually driving the improvement is it pulling back on hiring or something else thanks richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so i dont think were here to declare a i want to make a comment about marketing seasonality its not as thats not as much of a physics kind of thing as certain things like credit and delinquency seasonality with consumers i think so im not here to declare changes in the pattern of seasonality and marketing the big driver of our marketing is the opportunities that we see as well as the investment in building businesses like our heavy spender business and our national bank with respect to the drivers of operating efficiency improvement just kind of pulling up on the journey that you mentioned weve been focused about this and talking with investors about operating efficiency for years and weve achieved a basis point improvement from through even as we have invested in a comprehensive transformation of our technology over that same period of time and we know that investing in technology modernization and driving for efficiency improvements are on a shared path technology investment helps our revenue growth and helps drive productivity improvements and beneath the surface of the high level of investment has been significant productivity gains from modernizing our tech stack eliminating legacy vendor costs driving customers to digital and driving more automation in the company and at the same time of course we have continued to lean into this technology journey and the opportunities that it generates and the so its a very shared path capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 and i think that our guidance for modest improvement in is a reflection of continued traction in growth and operating productivity while also continuing to invest in future opportunities ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it i guess as a followup question maybe one for andrew andrew you laid out the details of some of the drivers as it pertains to the net interest margin i fully understand that theres a seasonal component to it in but can you maybe just talk about the positioning of the balance sheet from a rate perspective do you think that you can continue to see the margin drift higher and maybe just talk about of the drivers as you look out over the course of the next couple of quarters during the rising rate cycle thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure ryan recall its probably helpful to start with a little bit of history here and youll recall our nim was compressed during the pandemic largely driven by a balance sheet that was skewed much more towards cash and securities than card loans and as we progressed over the course of the pandemic you saw that begin to normalize and so just by way of evidence a yearago our nim was i think i had said in my prepared remarks and at that point card was closer to i think of our interestearning assets and cash and securities was something like cards now shifted to be just over and cash and securities are down to so i share that to say were now operating much closer to our prepandemic balance sheet mix and our nim is roughly in a similar spot to where it was before the pandemic so to your question then about rate risk you can see in our q our rate risk disclosures were really only slightly asset sensitive at this point and keep in mind thats relative to forwards so the basis point projected moves over the next couple of months are already sort of embedded in that neutral baseline and so as i think about the future theres a number of things that can impact nim not to mention seasonality but the credit impacts on revenue competitive pressure on loan margins and deposit pricing but as we sit here today i think a lot of the things that we pointed to in the past in terms of balance sheet mix at least have largely run their course so hopefully this gives you some sense of the primary forces that play with nim jeff norris a senior vice president global finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is now open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good evening andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hi betsy capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay just to follow up on that for the followup question so now that youre back to the prepandemic mix of liquidity and loans how should we think about where the balance sheet projects from here in terms of funding mix and funding stack and maybe you could speak a little bit to your thoughts on the buyback because i noticed this quarter it was down a bit million down a bit from the prior two quarters which averaged about billion so if you could help us understand how youre going to be funding the loan growth and what kind of mix we should be expecting should liquidity go down even more than what it was prepandemic thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp okay ill take i think what i heard is the first two questions there betsy in nim and funding and then ill turn it over to rich to talk about buyback so on the nim side and the asset portion of that i just want to clarify what will drive it from here i do think if you look back historically cash and securities were roughly of our balance sheet were a little bit above that but given our needs for liquidity and how we use the investment portfolio i would think that something in that range of the size of the balance sheet is a reasonable assumption for that then on the loan side it really becomes a matter of just marketplace dynamics what we see as opportunities for growth and so whether card is growing more quickly than say auto or commercial its percentage of the rest of the balance sheet could drift up but i dont want to give any indication of how we think thats playing out and theres certainly not a target that we have in terms of the asset side of the balance sheet on the funding side we aim to have a diversified mix of funding thats largely skewed to retail deposits which again historically has been something i think around of our overall funding and we have commercial deposits and brokered cds and then securitization and wholesale funding other sources of wholesale funding and so again i would say if you look back to prepandemic levels over history compared to where we are today were kind of back in a relatively similar place there so i think i heard in your question not just mix but how do we fund growth from here in making marginal decisions for funding incremental loan growth were going to weigh a variety of factors our customers appetite for different deposit products and our ability to build customer relationships with them the economics of different funding instruments the duration of funding or liquidity needs so were going to throw all of that into our decision making process to figure out how to fund but i also think its important to think about those funding choices at the margin its not just about the liability side we also have asset growth choices at the margin too so were just going to look at the total integrated economics of both sides of the balance sheet to make those choices and ill hand it over to rich to talk about buybacks richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 thanks andrew betsy we so with the question with respect to why did you slow down your share repurchase pace this quarter so we repurchased roughly million of shares during the third quarter about ayearand half ago we had a cet1 in the high since then weve been repurchasing shares and our cet1 ratio has come down into the low and the pace of our repurchases is of course driven by a number of factors including our actual and forecasted capital earnings of course growth economic conditions market dynamics and at this point there remains some pretty sizable error bars around some of these factors particularly growth and economic uncertainty and so its not lost on us at times like this its prudent risk management to be conservative with our capital actions and this is a very dynamic process and under the new scb rules were able to maintain flexibility in our capital decisions jeff norris a senior vice president global finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is now open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks rich you mentioned youre keeping an eye on your competitors im just wondering if you could just drill down a little bit on that given youve had a lot of fintechs in the space growing and obviously its a very unpredictable next to months so maybe you could just talk about domestic card and auto as well because you mentioned a number of different variables there thanks richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp well sanjay did you want me to talk about competition in those spaces or is it a competitiondriven question sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i guess competition but also how it might have an impact on credit as we look forward because youve had some new players underwriting as well richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp right so the lets talk about competition in the card business and then ill talk about it in the auto business but generally in the card business competition continues to be high but largely stable and rational over the past few quarters now here im really talking about the major the banking industry the classic competitive set within the card business but we certainly have seen marketing levels that have returned to really beyond prepandemic levels so we certainly have an eye on that on the rewards competition side theres here or there there are new things that people come out with but theres generally a stability in that space on aprs in the card business have generally the issuers have generally adjusted headline rates along with the change in the prime rate so theres a kind of a stability in the margins there capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 and so again we see a pretty stable competitive environment in the major among major card players a thing that weve mentioned a number of times is concerned about the fintechs and their impact on a business like the card business less so by the fintechs actually running around issuing credit cards but more by the impact from other credit products like installment loans buynowpaylater loans and others that can affect the portfolio of borrowing that our customers current and prospective customers might have so we were pretty concerned and weve talked about it a number of times about the rapidly growing extent of fintech credit extension compounded by the fact no one could measure the size of it because many of these folks like many of the buynowpaylater players for example not reporting to the credit bureaus the other thing that caught our eye of course all along the way here is virtually every fintech that enters lending enters in the lower side of the market theres virtually no one that enters right at the heaviest vendor side of the market they just dont have the scale for those thinmargin businesses and so the fintech accesses to the extent that theyre there were logically and inferentially from what we see would be more in the lower end of the market and that of course is something we watch pretty carefully to the best extent that we can see it now the one thing that that just intuitively is a helpful thing to the cause here is that fintechs have generally struggled they seem to have dialed back quite a bit so there may be less pressure in that particular space but another thing to keep our eye out for here is its not just the amount of volume of marketing or the intensity of competition its the underwriting choices that folks make another thing sanjay that we have had our eye on is basically fico drift and you can absolutely see out there the reduction in the size of the subprime population now we can all ask ourselves is that really just great news that the size of subprime america has declined or how much is that a shorterterm impact from all the stimulus the forbearance the spending pullbacks and things that happened during the pandemic so we ourselves do our best to try to normalize for those effects in our underwriting and so where i would pull up is to say i think the competitive risks that exist and that we have seen out there are more in the lower end of the marketplace even with credit cards themselves if you look at the data there has been the highest theres been more growth in the lower end of the market in terms of just credit card customers than anywhere else so all of this is something were watching incredibly carefully and to the earlier question that was asked about how do we do underwriting we of course do everything we can to look at every segment and to look for any changes that were seeing ultimately in our own performance weve trimmed around the edges in a few places but overall so far it looks pretty good but partly how we do this we dont just run around and just let the numbers do the talking we do a combination of using actually machine learning monitoringbased methodologies to look for early signs of things being off of expectation within our portfolio and then at the same time broad strategic logic on what would you expect to happen from this competitive environment from this credit environment from this inflationary environment so thats a window into that side of the business on the auto side of the business the competition i dont our issue with the competition is really not an underwriting issue at this point the general risks that we talked about just a couple of minutes ago exist in that space as well on the credit side but the elephant in the room is really the pricing of auto loans at this point by a number of players and while that is not directly a credit concern it lowers the margin in the business it lowers the buffer of resilience and so on and we manage very carefully to trying to keep a maximum amount of resilience in downturns and lower margins lead us to pull back on the least resilient parts of the business capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you very much jeff norris a senior vice president global finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse your line is now open moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks rich you had an earlier question about kind of the change in delinquency rates and im just im wondering whether if you think that this cycle there will be any sort of different relationship in your two major businesses in card and auto between the loss rate and delinquency rate better or worse as we go through the next months or so of credit normalization richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp well moshe as usual thats a very insightful question let me just comment a little bit on just a little bit of a calibration of how we think about credit in the card and auto businesses the first point would be its normalizing in both places but overall credit has been strong in both our card and our auto business but there are three effects that are driving faster normalization of auto losses then of card losses and the first is that normalization tends to be more pronounced in the front book of new originations thats a universal thing that applies across our consumer businesses but because the front book in auto the front book replaces the portfolio much more quickly than in card overall portfolio losses should normalize more quickly in the auto business the second is that recovery rates are much higher in auto than in card now recoveries tend to be lagged relative to chargeoffs but so some of the exceptionally strong performance we saw in auto including the quarter where we actually had negative chargeoffs that was boosted by higher recoveries from earlier chargeoffs now that weve seen low chargeoffs for an extended period in auto the raw material for future recoveries is coming down even if the recovery rate stays strong and this will have a bigger impact in auto than in card but it will be an effect in both businesses and its not something that i think gets a lot of airtime out there but recoveries are definitionally about whats happening with a if you will the back book of recoveries and in both of our businesses the back book which has been the byproduct of the great news over the last few years in terms of credit to back book theres just less to work with but its especially an effect in auto and finally auto vehicle values are now normalizing which is a headwind relative to a yearago and contributes to the pace of credit normalization in that business and given where used car prices have been going to sort of record levels over the past year the general direction of that is much more likely to be down rather than up so that also contributes to a difference between those two businesses capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it thanks as a followup its good to see the guidance or some form of expectation of an improving efficiency ratio but as i look at it it seems like your balance sheet is still asset sensitive and so to the extent that revenue growth is impacted and positively impacted by margin expansion i mean wouldnt one really naturally expect to see that efficiency ratio improve because that doesnt really come with a lot of attendant costs so im just wondering how to think about that and whats the right way to think about the spend kind of likefor like spending versus revenue growth andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp moshe let me take the first part of that and then ill hand it over to rich in terms of asset sensitivity you can see last quarters q and i would expect it will be a fairly similar number this quarter an up basis point shock last quarter was basis point impact to 12month nii which is something like a couple of hundred million dollars of nii and again thats a shock relative to forwards so i just want to clarify that when you talk about us being asset sensitive weve already baked into our baseline the anticipated call it basis points of additional fed moves over the next couple of quarters so achieving what i just described suggests the shock beyond that but i think you should walk around with at this point we are pretty neutral from an asset sensitivity so i just wanted to clarify that before rich provides the broader answer richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes moshe the ive often said and you and i have gosh weve been working together for two or three decades now moshe and ive often said that i know we do a calculation that says this is on the things that we can measure this is the impact of lets say a rise in rates ive often said it can look good on paper to have a rise in rates but i for three decades have been rooting against rises in rates because of the sort of unquantifiable other aspects on the business now of course no one out here is rooting for the kind of inflation that were seeing and the kind of risk there but i just want to flag that while the math talks about certain benefits that come just a couple kind of obvious but i think important things that affect many of our metrics in the business one is the conversation that we just had about the auto business i think its most businesses in the world most industries struggle when the cost of goods sold goes up struggle to get that to make its way into pricing and the auto business is a classic example of this and particularly since unlike if youre selling groceries at the store its pretty clear whats the cost of goods sold and therefore how you might want to price those groceries in this business with the complexity that comes from how any particular auto lender calculates their funds transfer pricing and really effectively what is their margin that can put pressures in the business and what were seeing in auto the compression in margins the growth opportunity that were losing right now that can sort of swamp the math of andrews interest rate calculations and then of course i think the biggest issue is the impact of rising rates on the economy and on potentially credit outcomes and back to our friend the operating efficiency ratio credit impacts make their way into the operating efficiency ratio of course through well through the growth through how much growth we can get and also things like the fee and finance charge reserve impacts that come capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 so im not yes so thats why i think in many ways the kind of progress that we continue to hope to achieve over the years an operating efficiency ratio might be more in spite of rather than because of higher rates jeff norris a senior vice president global finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from arren cyganovich with citi your line is now open arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks i was hoping you could talk a little bit about the card acquisitions that youre having today and youre a full spectrum lender but your i guess i would characterize i guess newer in the heavy spend section and with your venture x card are you acquiring more of that segment and then also have you been pulling back at all in maybe revolver nonprime segment recently richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah so the we have talked a lot about the traction that were getting at the top of the market in the pursuit of heavy spenders and i wouldnt call us relatively new player in that business were one of the actually pretty significant players in the space but certainly not the biggest not even close but i think that the bigger point there is that we continue to see more traction there and whenever we you see metrics about growth in purchase volume we dont share metrics about what kind of growth rate were getting at each spender level in the marketplace but the higher the spender level the higher the even faster growth rate weve been getting so thats a manifestation of the success were getting and its a its both the byproduct of the investment were making but also leads us to continue to lean into those investments but for all you hear of our enthusiastic comments about the top of the market i dont want to leave an impression that we are therefore less enthusiastic about the opportunity elsewhere we continue to grow across the credit spectrum we have several decades of experience in the lower end of the market and one of the real benefits of our tech transformation has been allowing us to build a lot more sophistication more data more machine learning and other things into the credit underwriting process and that allows us to be stronger and have more growth opportunities and better credit quality in the at the lower end of the market so the story the net impression i want to leave with you is one of very continued success across the spectrum there are places however that we for a long period of time have been cautious about and frankly doing our best to minimize and one of those is highbalance revolvers so highbalance revolvers which just what the term we that term to us just to clarify that concept is not necessarily what are the balances that any revolver any customer might have with us but its collectively their total bureau balances and we have been very cautious about booking customers for years now and even more so after the great recession booking customers with a high level of balance revolver balances across their that consumers portfolio it tends to be to not go there ties one hand behind our back a little bit in terms of growth because the growing highbalance revolvers is a good way to grow and it also tends to be quite profitable business but that is capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 a segment that we have been concerned about the resilience and downturns and so weve tended to for years now try to deemphasize that i say deemphasize no one can fully get out of a segment like that because the we cant control whether our own customers turn into highbalance revolvers but what we can control is whether they enter as highbalance revolvers so thats a little window into maybe where we go a little more lightly arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thank you jeff norris a senior vice president global finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from don fandetti with wells fargo your line is now open donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi rich can you talk a little bit on the move to the public cloud its been a bit since weve heard a lot on that are you still feeling like its improving your new product development rollout technical difficulty richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes well don we feel great about our move to the public cloud its a central part of our technology transformation probably the most salient part of it but certainly not the only part but this transformation has involved a transformation in terms of the tech talent within the company bringing lots of thousands of engineers inhouse bringing more of the tech investment inside the company as opposed to reliance on vendors so many of them industrywide who are old school legacy vendors and quite expensive at that its involving involved transforming how we build software its involved going to the cloud its involved transforming our data ecosystem its involved modernizing all of the applications on which the company is built so theres been a lot to this journey and were a decade into it the benefits are all around us and our it really starts in many ways with benefits in the tech business itself where our technology teams are moving faster getting products to market sooner and our software engineers its are just way more modern tech stack to work with and automated software delivery methods and can also to your cloud point benefit by the tremendous not just with a tremendous and continuing innovations that are happening on the cloud our customer experiences to continue to get more and more just better and better and some of the and we noticed it in net promoter scores and occasional awards that capital one wins the new products weve been able to innovate things like capital one shopping virtual cards dealer navigator instant issuance many things have been very benefited there i mentioned earlier the ability to get some transformational improvements on underwriting fraud management and a lot of things behind the scenes that leverage the power of big data and machine learning in real time that has been very beneficial our transformation also is changing how we work inside capital one our new marketing capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 platforms are part of the reason that were investing more these days in marketing is really the power of mass customized machine learningdriven marketing so thats been a good thing and its also as i mentioned earlier had a bunch of benefits in terms of enhancing productivity of the business and the final thing i would say there don is that the tech transformation is really helping us get more of the thing we needed to start with to make it happen and that was talent the biggest elephant in the room for corporate america who sit on legacy tech stacks is you need lots and lots of very modern bestinclass tech talent in order to drive that transformation in a world where the scarcest the tightest and most competitive labor market ive seen in the history of building capital one is the competition for really modern tech talent the transformation requires so much of that talent and one of our rewards is now as we get on the other side of the canyon and really have a tech stack built like the very modern tech companies the ability to attract talent is accelerating and thats part of a virtuous cycle that is why we did it its why we went on this journey and its something that we see to this very day and its also why we continue to invest more in the opportunities that we see jeff norris a senior vice president global finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from rick shane with jpmorgan your line is now open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys its rick shane i think guys just got called on andrew a quick question for you when we look at the reserve rate on the domestic card portfolio it ticked up slightly most of the build was a function of portfolio growth context is yearoveryear the single biggest increase in delinquencies that weve seen im curious when you think about the factors setting the allowance going forward have you incorporated the trajectory of how fast delinquencies are increasing or is it a function of where delinquencies are now and an economic outlook and can you capture that sort of rate of change andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure rick well let me just start by talking about the inputs to the allowance i just think its important to sort of ground on the mechanics the entirety of the mechanics not just the piece that you called out so the first factor of course is just the size of the balance sheet the second is really aligned to what you were just talking about but its kind of a combination of factors and that is really our outlook for future losses net of recoveries against that balance sheet so that starts from a place of looking at what is in the delinquency buckets today which gives us a really good view of how the next say six months or so of losses are going to play out and then after that period we have an assumption of continued normalization from those unusually strong levels and then beyond that horizon as i think you know under cecl theres just an assumption of a gradual revision to historical averages and then the third point is we apply qualitative factors against all of those expectations to account for uncertainties around economic downsides and inflationrelated risks and so when we think about the allowance capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 going forward yes i mean todays allowance of course does incorporate in what is in the delinquency buckets today and what that implies but as we go forward the allowance is really going to primarily be determined by just the growth in the balance sheet and we saw that impact the allowance this quarter but then secondly every quarter we continue to normalize we are going to be replacing lower loss content of the current quarter with higher loss content of future quarters which again will be informed by how the delinquencies are playing through each successive quarter so theres a number of other modest considerations but thats really the two big forces at play and hopefully that gets to kind of the nature of your question richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc it does and i guess what im really trying to understand is that if we follow the path that you expect in terms of normalization and whats embedded in the reserves today and economic outlook doesnt change because again i realize thats something you cant control if you follow the expected path will does that mean the allowance stay static or do you follow along that path i think thats what im really trying to get to andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp well youre going to follow along that path because then when we get to a quarter from now were going to apply all of those same factors to the allowance at a quarter from now and the change in the allowance is just going to be the quantum of allowance we have today compared to the quantum of allowance that we would have doing those exact same things a quarter from now jeff norris a senior vice president global finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research your line is now open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good evening rich and andrew following up on that last question what level of unemployment would you say is implicit in your allowance and marrying some of the micro with the macro from the earlier discussion how does capital one view the risk that some of the credit normalization trends that youre seeing currently will ultimately be accompanied by some degree of degradation to the extent that the fed proceeds through the hiking cycle andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp why dont i take the first one and i must admit im not quite sure i followed the second so if rich followed that otherwise well come back to you for clarification but in terms of unemployment im not going to provide specific metrics or economic assumptions i will say though bill we are generally consumers of like industry forecasts as opposed to developing our own capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 so i think you could look at general consensus expectations for all of the key economic variables and assume that that kind of roughly approximates what underlies our economic views on those variables and im looking at rich to see if he follow the second part of your question richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp bill i think your question was im going to put it in different words just to see if im saying the same thing weve got normalization going on right now with an economy that in some ways certainly employmentwise and some metrics not in a terrible place and you have normalization when normalization meets potentially significant economic worsening coming out of the or may be catalyzed by the fed going through their tightening right now how do we feel about that was that your question bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yes richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp im going to start doing earnings calls by just asking the questions and then answering but look that is a great question and i think none of us should just be mathematical about normalization now ive talked about how the root word in normalization is normal because what is abnormal is that credit ever got to this onceinalifetime place it did during the pandemic so as ive said in absolutely normal times this thing should normalize so the way so we look at that and say and expect that that should continue and then we look at the economy in the way that we would always look at that as weve done many times weve been looking down the gun barrel of a potentially highly uncertain and maybe likely a worse economy and its certainly hard to be in the prediction business but what we do is we theres a couple of big things that we do as an approach first of all we underwrite to an assumption of worsening we try to make it so if things go bad its not a surprise that it would be really bad banking to be underwriting to good scenarios and i know everyone tries to be conservative but im just saying with over three decades in building this company at the heart of it is underwriting that looks in the rearview mirror of how programs are doing and overlaying a worsening assumption on that because that is could happen and we need to be resilient to that so youll often hear capital one talking about the word resilience without a crystal ball about whats going to happen over time the critical thing is what is the resilience of the loans that we are booking and we spend a lot of time for example in the card business just looking at the ratio of revenue margin to the chargeoff rates and stressing that and all kinds of things so we underwrite to worsening thats a very important thing secondly it is the management of credit decisions at the micro level so that were looking for the earliest indications of where problems can occur and like i said earlier thats both theres let me just give you a little bit of window into that we of course have our way that we look at how all our businesses are doing and all of our vintages are doing we leverage machine learning though to also look for aberrations and anomalies that happen faster than they would show up with a report and maybe coming from sources that would not be our standard set of variables by which otherwise our models would look at the business capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 and so realtime machine learningdriven monitoring is really important in any environment but we its really important in an environment like this because were looking for because we expect anomalies to happen we expect some of our segments to be stressed in even the current environment certainly as things get worse and so were on the lookout and we have machine learning to help us and then as i mentioned earlier and sorry to be repetitive but but then but its not just letting the machines and the models do the work is standing back and saying gathering people around and saying lets think of all the things that could go wrong what do you think will go wrong and what where would weaknesses appear and then based on that intuition we go hunting for them and all of the different approaches have been bearing fruit lately on a more modest basis in the card business and a little bit bigger basis in the auto business and i would expect as the environment gets if it gets a whole lot worse from here were going to theres going to be a lot of active trimming all over the place and so its a combination of literally the most micro and analytical approaches marrying the most intuitive and big picture judgmental approach to managing risk jeff norris a senior vice president global finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from mihir bhatia with bank of america your line is now open mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi thank you but i wanted to ask about the i appreciate your comments earlier about youre enthusiastic about all of card lending so full spectrum but just given the recent focus on the higher spend and the more transactor type customers i was wondering if you think that growing that portion a little bit maybe that portion has been growing at an outsized rate how is that growth of that subsegment potentially change the card portfolios performance through the cycle or in a downturn richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp that is a great question in fact let me pull up for a second before i answer your question we have very gradually across the business paralleling the move to the top of the market all across our business we have been leaning harder into the spender side of the business and just continuing to be most attracted to customers who are there to spend whose patterns would be more consistent with the spending side of the business even as there is a bunch of revolving so across our business there has been a very gradual but purposeful migration for years toward the spender side so ill put that down there and then the second thing is the avoidance of highbalance revolvers and then thirdly the thing youre pointing to the importantly increasing mix of heavy spenders in our business the impact i think when a downturn comes these things that weve been leading into and things weve been avoiding should be all other things equal beneficial to the performance of the business in terms of the credit losses themselves the payment rates that we experienced there during the business and part of why we have leaned into spenders more is just because all the evidence that we have seen is that it tends to just be pound for pound a more resilient group capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 so while its not a controlled experiment i think the net effect of these changes will be beneficial to the credit results and i think enhance the resilience of the business that we have booked mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc thank you and then just if i could ask just about the tech investments that youve been making can you talk about just how do they improve your ability to flex expenses as the competitive or macro environment changes thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp ironically i think they may be make things a little less flexible to on the expense side let me explain that an increasing part of our cost structure as a company is our is our is the tech business that we have built its got a lot of fixed cost to it and so that is not i wouldnt want to set an expectation that our sort of tech stack and our tech company that we have built is a more variable cost business because if anything it might be a little more fixed cost business now there within that choices on what we invest in and the timing of those always create flexibility and in stressful times theyre certainly on the investment side within tech can be more flexibility there but the tech investment though pulling way up has tremendously enhanced capital ones overall flexibility our ability to turn quickly in the marketplace to make credit choices if you look back to the when we all went when the world went into vertical free fall of uncertainty in the pandemic just look back at how quickly capital one turned with respect to some of the pullbacks we did that would not have been possible in the more legacy world that we lived in before so the ability to respond quickly the ability to create changes in the offerings to consumers the ability to create we have flexibility and offerings flexibility and forbearance new ways to adapt to the marketplace everything about capital one the speed of change of managed change is dramatically different from before we also and this is probably the most important recession resilience point is the monitoring point i made earlier to have put in place a much more comprehensive realtime monitoring capability with root cause analysis thats much more comprehensive than what we could have done before will allow us to be informed earlier on about things that are happening and i do want to say ive been asked by a number of investors rich we know you well enough to know how cautious you are about the economy and about downturns and the utmost respect for what how risk can play out in these businesses why are you leaning into the marketing opportunity and one of the reasons that were doing that is this substantially improved measurement monitoring and speed of response and the level of segmentation and micro segmentation by which we can do that gives us allows the sort of paradoxical thing to lean in more than we otherwise might have been able to do jeff norris a senior vice president global finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our final question this evening comes from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer your line is now open capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc hey can you hear me this is dominick from oppenheimer richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes dominick andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yes dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay sorry i guess so is there any reason rich why you would expect the payment hierarchy among consumer products in which they choose to pay or default lets say in times of severe stress is there any reason why anything youre seeing that would change that hierarchy this cycle around from previous cycles and then i just have a followup thank you richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp dominick thats a great question i can only sort of speculate here but the most striking thing about the global financial crisis and great recession that from a payment hierarchy point of view is what we saw with people literally walking away from their mortgages and what was really high on the payment hierarchy was auto loans and we and that may be a kind of a more universal resilience point on the auto side because people still have to drive to work and so thats probably more of a sustaining insight i think that the we got to look at student loans and think about where i think weve already observed thats pretty low in the payment hierarchy and trends these days and forgiveness and various things there would probably ensure thats on the lower end another one that i would probably just speculate to add to the hierarchy this year is this time around is fintechs and i think the fintechs who dont report to the credit bureaus may have enjoyed their stealth opportunity to grow but thats probably not lost on the consumers and so i think one of the reasons weve really leaned harder into having spending be the anchor part of a consumer credit card relationship is that its not only a healthier place to be from the consumer point of view but i think counting on that credit card and making sure that youve got that in a downturn that helps from a payment hierarchy point of view dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay great and then just when you just think of i just want to go back to the tech investment and spend and how you think about it over the cycle and perhaps even some of the peers that you talked to at conferences how do you as one of the countrys largest banks think about the investment that you put on and what do you find does have what type of economic factors is it nim is it nii growth changes or the credit growth changes that can have you put the brakes on the edges on yearoveryear growth and tech investment spend thank you so much capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2022 richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you dominick these are all great questions we in case you havent noticed i have a pretty deep conviction about the benefit of these tech investments and thats not just how i feel thats how all of us collectively feel here at capital one and the benefits of that tech investment are so comprehensive although the company inside this company we can see them everywhere and they do so enhance how we work the ability to manage risk the ability to serve customers the ability to create new products the ability to grow and so we do and because we see such benefits we are continuing to lean into tech investments and as i mentioned earlier theres sort of under the surface quite a bit of productivity gain coming from the tech investment but on the other hand at the same time were leaning in pretty hard into tech investments such that its the effects are not that dramatic in fact over close to a decade theres been a more gradual kind of improvement in operating efficiency we theres always the opportunity if times get really tough to pull back on tech investments but we are not viewing these like luxury investments and just what to do on a sunny day because they are very materially transforming the opportunities of this company and the ability to manage risk and the ability to weather the very downturn that might motivate that reduction in investment jeff norris senior vice president global finance capital one financial corp well thank you everyone for joining us on the conference call audio gap capital one
