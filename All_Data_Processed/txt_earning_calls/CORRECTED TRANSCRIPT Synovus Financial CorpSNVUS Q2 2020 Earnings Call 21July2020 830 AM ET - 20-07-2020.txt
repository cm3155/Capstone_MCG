good morning to everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings call before i move to the financials i just wanted to share a few comments and reflections on our industry and our company the defining characteristic of our industry is changed and ive certainly seen my share of change in my fourand ahalf decades in this business including this unprecedented pandemic and period of social unrest and although pain is relentless ive never been more convinced of the ability and responsibility of our industry to be a trusted resource for our customers and for the communities we serve synovus in particular is built for times like these embedded in our markets close to our customers and able to quickly assess and anticipate needs and that continues to ring true as challenges linger even as we see glimpses of a slow and steady recovery the story well tell today is largely shaped by our model that has allowed us to respond to plan for and do our best to control the things we can control so before i turn the call over to jamie ill share highlights of the second quarter beginning on slide adjusted diluted eps was compared to last quarter and a year ago loan balances increased billion or compared to the prior quarter growth in paycheck protection program loans of billion was offset by a reduction in ci line utilization of million in the consumer book loans were down approximately synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 million as reductions in lending partnership balances were partially offset by mortgage balance increases of million total deposits grew billion or from the prior quarter growth was largely split between dda and interest bearing core deposits which grew billion and billion respectively we continued the strategy of allowing higherpriced cds to run off which led to a decline of million in time deposits net interest income was up million for the quarter this included a full quarter of the basis point reduction in shortterm rates from march along with offsets including over million in fee recognition associated with ppp loans the net interest margin declined basis points to adjusted noninterest revenue of million was greater than expected largely due to outperformance in mortgage net mortgage revenue was million up million from the prior quarter led by secondary mortgage production of million up million from the prior quarter adjusted noninterest expense totaled million up million from the previous quarter this included million of covidrelated expenses and million in fees associated with the implementation of certain synovus forward initiatives commission expense was million higher than the prior quarter largely resulting from record mortgage production these increases were offset by reductions in other areas including seasonal employment fees and travel provision for credit losses was million and resulted in an allowance for credit losses ratio of excluding the ppp balances thats an increase of basis points from the previous quarter and incorporates a more stressed economic outlook credit quality metrics remain stable with the nonperforming loan ratio and net chargeoff ratio of basis points and basis points respectively capital ratios improved based on strong operating performance and balance sheet optimization which jamie will detail later in the presentation our cet1 ratio increased basis points to and our total riskbased capital ratio increased basis points to end at a twoyear high the 90day deferral program we outlined on the last call has done exactly what it was intended to do by providing much needed support and assistance for our customers while its too early to know exactly how deferrals will play out in the second half of with use of customer cash flows client surveys and conversations and interactions with customers todate lead us to believe that somewhere between to of total loans will have a round two deferral granted for a 90day deferment of principal and interest jamie will now share more detail about the quarter andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kessel as kessel noted this is a very eventful quarter for our company with considerable progress on a number of fronts despite headwinds the resulting impact on our balance sheet has been significant starting with loans on slide as we shared in may we funded billion in ppp loans for approximately customers quite an undertaking which required a coordinated effort across our bank the average ppp loan was approximately and the customers that received those loans employ over employees an offset to the ci growth from ppp loans which ended the quarter with the balance of billion was a decrease in loan balances from ci line utilization we ended the second quarter at a record low of that synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 resulted in balance sheet declines of million we expect ci line utilization to normalize in the mid to upper range as the economy improves highlights in the consumer portfolio include mortgage loan balance increases of over million on a production of our record million as was disclosed during the quarter we restructured our greensky relationship in a way that is mutually beneficial our total exposure limit remains billion for the relationship but you will see a shift of loan balances from heldforinvestment to heldforsale in the second quarter we moved million in loans to heldforsale under this new arrangement going forward you will see a shift in geography on the income statement from our greensky loans as we realize more noninterest revenue from transactions and servicing fees as well as reduction in net interest income and non interest expense the other meaningful item to highlight within partnership lending is a disposition of approximately million in student loans in june we moved those loans to heldforsale which contributed to the decline in consumer balances and resulted in an allowance release of approximately million we have closed that transaction since quarterend realizing a modest gain which will be recorded in the third quarter we believe that the strength of the market for these loans is a testament to the quality of these loan portfolios and we remain committed to those relationships while also acknowledging that our core customer base takes priority as we focus on managing our balance sheet in these uncertain times we continue to expect loans to be flat for the remainder of the year excluding the impact of ppp forgiveness on slide you can see that we had unprecedented growth in deposits with dda balances up billion and total deposits up billion in the second quarter much of this growth occurred in conjunction with our ppp lending effort however we also saw broadbased growth across interestbearing transaction balances with money market and now up quarteroverquarter while savings balances increased by quarterover quarter while lowercost transactional deposit growth has accelerated since late in the first quarter we have continued to experience strategic declines within our core time deposit portfolio as you are aware much of these declines have been intentional over the last several quarters as we reduced exposure to highercost cds and public funds in certain markets one of the benefits of having a sizable time deposit portfolio is the ability to reprice as rates decline and that portfolio turns over with our transactional interestbearing accounts approaching lowest rates experienced since the great financial crisis we expect further declines in rate paid on deposits to be led by strategic turnover within our core and broker time deposit portfolios as a simple means of comparison to the prior cycle synovus achieved its lowest deposit cost in the third quarter of at that time total interestbearing deposit costs were roughly basis points while our deposit mix has evolved from that time we believe a return to comparable levels is achievable in the coming quarters with continued pricing and balance sheet discipline we expect deposits to decline in the second half of as excess liquidity is deployed slide shows net interest income of million an increase of million from the previous quarter this benefited from million in fee accretion from our ppp loan portfolio in the coming quarters ppp forgiveness may have a meaningful impact on our net interest income as unearned fees associated with that program are recognized in the interest income ppp processing fees totaled million synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 in terms of net interest margin we ended the quarter at down basis points from the first quarter beyond the anticipated impact associated with the lower rate environment the significant inflow of deposits throughout the quarter resulted in an excess cash position which while not impactful to net interest income diluted the margin by approximately basis points as compared to the prior quarter although we expect to maintain an elevated level of liquidity within the current economic environment we also anticipate some reversal in that elevated position in the second half of the year which should support the margin balance sheet management activities in the second quarter including securities portfolio sales the student loan sale and the greensky strategy change will serve as a headwind to net interest income beginning in the third quarter and will put some additional downward pressure on the margin the impact of these recent transactions is approximately basis points to the margin after adjusting for these impacts and excluding the impact of ppp loans we expect the margin to remain relatively stable in the second half of we were pleased with noninterest revenue of million or million adjusted shown on slide transaction activities including capital markets activities mortgage originations and credit card transactions exceeded our expectations and we had one of our strongest quarters in fee revenue we realized investment gains of million which includes million from repositioning the securities portfolio while these transactions were primarily focused on agency mortgagebacked securities part of the repositioning included the disposition of our remaining million in collateralized loan obligations in the investment portfolio total net mortgage revenue was million which was million more than the previous quarter this is the result of an alltime high of million in secondary mortgage production and an elevated gain on sale looking forward to the third quarter we do not expect net mortgage revenue to stay at the record level of the second quarter led by normalization of mortgage revenue we believe a reduction of adjusted noninterest revenue in the third quarter is likely before we see a return to consistent growth in fee revenue noninterest expense of million or million adjusted is shown on slide as expected we had approximately million in covidrelated expenses in the second quarter these included bonuses to certain frontline team members as well as efforts to improve the safety of our team members and customers adjustments for the quarter of million included expenses of million related to branch closures and restructuring of corporate real estate as well as million in expenses related to the global one earn out liability adjusted expenses included the million in covidrelated expenses as well as an increase in commission expense million higher than the prior quarter due to elevated mortgage production the second quarter also had million in upfront expenses related to efforts weve made to implement and execute certain synovus forward initiatives these efforts will help us achieve sustainable top quartile performance that kevin will provide an update for shortly consistent with prior guidance we expect the expenses to decline in the second half of the year current credit ratios shown at the top of slide which include npas npls and past dues remain stable we generally expect some pressure on these credit metrics over the next few quarters which aligns with the reserve builds in the first half of the year under the procyclical nature of cecl although loan deferrals have an impact on these metrics its important to note that we are not seeing any widespread deterioration in the portfolio and these ratios remain at or near lows for this credit cycle the net chargeoff ratio was basis points up basis points from the prior quarter net chargeoffs of million largely resulted from a single credit that was moved to nonaccrual last quarter synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 provision for credit losses of million resulted in an allowance build of nearly million from the current expectation for longerterm economic headwinds after adjusting for p3 loans the acl ratio increased basis points to the economic assumptions for the current quarter include the estimated impact of stimulus and an unemployment rate declining to around by the end of the year and remaining elevated throughout we anticipate moderate economic expansion following the dramatic spikes in real gdp expected in the second and third quarters of the year economic uncertainty remains great due in part to the direct impact of covid the acl ratio could remain elevated due to this economic uncertainty and credit migration which could result in todays allowance for credit losses not fully funding future chargeoffs slide includes a review of our capital position as we ended the second quarter our focus remains on diligently managing our balance sheet and capital in alignment with our risk appetite and capital adequacy process and you can see the result of that effort in our capital ratios cet1 improved basis points to and total risk based capital rose basis points to the highest level in two years actions included student loan sales and the settlement of security trades in july will further reduce riskweighted assets and will benefit cet1 by approximately basis points in the third quarter as it relates specifically to common shareholder dividends we continue to be guided by two considerations capital adequacy and longterm earnings we remain confident in our current capital levels which is supported by stress testing and sensitivity analysis we believe its important for shareholders to receive current income on their investment and also for us to retain enough capital for our strategic growth objectives to achieve those objectives a total longterm payout ratio of to is appropriate with approximately half of that coming from common shareholder dividends before handing off to kevin id like to summarize our thoughts on the balance sheet we remain confident in our capital position and the second quarter has shown we have the means to further support capital when needed from december to june we increased our allowance by approximately million while maintaining a stable cet1 ratio given the elevated uncertainty we are not planning to repurchase shares in and will use future earnings to build capital and grow our businesses we expect our primary means of capital return to be through dividends and accretion of our tangible book value with that ill turn it over to kevin to speak further on our efforts to assist customers through this environment give enhanced detail within our credit portfolio and an update on our progress within synovus forward kevin blair president chief operating officer synovus financial corp thank you jamie ill begin on slide with an update to the segments we highlighted on the last call that we defined as particularly sensitive to covid19 balances totaled billion in these industries which is stable with the prior quarter when we implemented a 90day deferral program in late march we utilized a review process particularly on our larger customers to assess the impact of the economic conditions that warranted a deferment to help address shortterm changes in cash flow as these deferrals end we have once again taken a proactive approach and conducted thorough cash burn analyses on our customers to determine who will continue to see reduced levels of cash flows over the next and days synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 what we found is that a large percentage of the companies experiencing a longerterm impact to cash flows are encompassed in five of the segments identified on this slide let me touch on each industry briefly ill start with the hotel industry which continues to see a to decrease in occupancy and revenue per available room given the reopenings in the southeast and the increase in occupancy in various drivable vacation destinations we expect cash flows to increase somewhat in the coming months and as a result the overall deferral rate of the hotel portfolio to range between and in the next days as we shared last quarter this portfolio maintains a strong loan to value slightly over and it entered the downturn with almost times debt service coverage for nongrocery anchored shopping centers we expect to see deferments in the range of to as certain types of retail are performing well such as home improvement and electronics while other retail reopens and resumes their sources of revenue moving to restaurants this industry benefited greatly from the p3 program and we are seeing more significant improvements in the quickserve and fast casual businesses which will lead to a reduction in secondround deferrals however we continue to see a lag in revenue recapture in fullservice and drinking establishments similar to shopping centers the impact on the retail trade industry is largely a function of the type of goods sold but we are seeing an improvement here as well with overall cash flows increasing in june versus the previous year with solid growth in beer and wine furniture and grocery relatedtrade and therefore we expect to of the portfolio to pursue a second round of principal and interest deferments fitness recreation and entertainment centers are among the industries hardest hit by the shutdown but golf courses and country clubs are faring better despite the softness in some of the entertainment industries we do expect this industry to have low percentage of secondround deferments our oilrelated segment totaling approximately million in outstandings was initially of greater concern due to the negative oil futures and the impact of less travel despite those concerns we saw a lower percentage of first round deferments and expect this portfolio to continue to perform well with minimal secondround deferments in aggregate while deferral trends are positive to this point we are keenly aware that any additional mandated closings from the covid surges in our markets would have the potential of impacting cash flows and therefore increasing the need for additional deferments at this point i would like to draw your attention to slide in the appendix another notable segment that is often discussed as a covidimpacted industry that is not on this list is our senior housing portfolio which is over billion in outstandings we have not included senior housing on this slide based on the solid performance of this portfolio and our outlook on future performance the reason for exclusion is supported by the fact that we have only seen of the outstanding balances deferred in round one which was comprised of five loans and the expectation at this time is that we will have no further deferments in the portfolio during round two in addition we continue to work closely with our customers and the industry associations as well as actively monitor cash flows which have trended down only modestly to date our senior housing portfolio primarily includes private pay facilities that had better access to resources including staffing and equipment this portfolio is led by a very seasoned team with a stellar track record dealing with longtime operators the portfolio carries strong ltvs and debt service coverage metrics and is strategically synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 aligned with sponsors who have access to liquidity and have demonstrated commitment to the space over several decades in terms of overall portfolio deferments a significant percentage of our first day deferrals have expired and at this point we are seeing a relatively low level of additional request which is partially due to the timing of payment due dates as of july of the total loan portfolio was in a 90day deferral status we will continue to gain additional insights in the coming weeks but based upon current conditions activity to date and ongoing discussions with our customers as kessel mentioned earlier we believe this percentage could increase into the range of to this quarter the process for granting a second deferral takes into consideration the borrowers current financial condition and liquidity the impact to the borrowers industry from covid19 and the performance history of the borrower precovid the strength of our portfolio coming into the crisis combined with the assistance from deferrals and government stimulus programs should help many customers weather this storm and help to minimize defaults combining these actions with strong loantovalues and good sponsorship should help to mitigate and limit future losses moving to slide this is an example of the analyses weve conducted to identify and assess the financial strength of our borrowers this work is supported by our commercial portfolio transaction data where we have the primary operating accounts approximately twothirds of our commercial loan exposures have an operating account open with us and we have been comparing their cash inflows which can serve as a proxy for revenues on a yearoveryear basis to assess and predict their ability to repay debt during this crisis using this data we have validated the impact to cash inflows between our customers who received the deferral and those who have not as well as the pace of improvement our customers overall had experienced improved cash flows since the trough in april with the month of june exhibiting only a reduction in cash inflows relative to the same month last year this analysis is constructive in evaluating current conditions but more importantly it enables a more realtime analysis versus traditional underwriting criteria and provides a prediction of cash flows throughout the current economic cycle the predictive analytics allows us to determine which customers require intervention and whether for example a deferral or bridge facility could provide the support needed to supplement shortterm cash flow disruption it also provides early identification of customers where the outlook is less optimistic thereby allowing us to take earlier action to reduce and mitigate losses as we turn from credit to slide before i talk about the future let me briefly touch on the present despite the challenging environment our businesses continue to perform well you have heard from kessel and jamie on the financial results this quarter and those results reflect the ongoing success we have across our geography and our business units i want to highlight several areas that continue to perform at a high level in this difficult economy first as we have mentioned several times on todays call our mortgage business produced billion in the second quarter which was up million or over the first quarter of this year yes the low rate environment helped drive volume but its important to also note that mortgage loan originators recruited since january have produced of the yeartodate volume successful recruiting in the past two years has also proven to be a key factor in our mortgage growth second we continue to bolster our balance sheet and pl through productivity gains with mortgage and wholesale banking leading the way second quarter funded loan production was up versus the same quarter synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 last year and deposit production with increases in all of our lines of business was up versus second quarter the deposit growth is a great example of how our relationshipbased model continues to deliver results this quarters results reflect the growth in both balances and accounts it is a function of new customers being gained through the ppp process new talent that weve added as well as thorough consistent prospecting efforts while continuing to see existing customers augment their balances next as weve also shared in the past we have been aggressively adding talent and new services in our treasury and payment solutions area as a result production revenue of million in the quarter was up versus the second quarter of lastly our global one premium finance business unit continues to generate strong growth while improving returns and the overall efficiency of operations as a result of this continued success and the successful integration within synovus we have expanded the responsibility of the executive leadership to now lead our specialty finance division which includes structured lending and asset base lending underlying all of these results we have seen more significant yeartodate growth in markets where we have made substantial investments in talent in marketing and in distribution channels markets such as atlanta tampa miami birmingham and greenville south carolina drive a large portion of our overall growth and speaking of talent we have continued to selectively attract top talent and growth markets throughout this quarter across all of our businesses we have achieved these results while our customer satisfaction scores and our branches and our contact centers remain quite high and theyve actually increased versus historical levels all of these areas as well as others i have not mentioned give me great confidence in our ability to win and when we return to a state of normalcy we will be even better positioned to do so as i close let me transition to our synovus forward initiative which weve highlighted on slide we remain focused on the execution of this program to drive incremental efficiencies and sources of new revenue in and beyond our financial objective of an incremental million in pretax income remains intact with the efficiency benefits being realized early in while the revenue benefits will continue to build throughout next year our work on one of our largest expense initiatives our thirdparty spend concluded last week this work stream was accelerated and has proven to be quite fruitful with the identified savings from the renegotiation and demand management efforts yielding savings of around million these benefits will be fully realized in our run rate expenses in we have also completed phase of our branch consolidation in corporate real estate optimization efforts and are diligently working on subsequent opportunities that will result in additional savings in we remain confident in our ability to generate million to million in expense savings through this program while we have focused more intently on the efficiency initiatives out of the gate we have also turned our attention to the revenue opportunities that were identified during the diagnostic phase with the total potential pretax income of between million and million analytics enhancement is at the center of many of these opportunities as i mentioned previously during the second quarter we utilized the resources on this work stream to build out our credit analytics and predictive modeling capabilities to create early warning mechanisms that will allow us to take actions to mitigate and reduce credit losses we will benefit from this work in the coming quarters synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 but this work will also serve as the baseline analytic framework to generate advancements in our sales and our service activities as well as improvements in our overall relationship profitability moreover as we enter we will be in a better position to optimize the pricing of our depository and treasury products and solutions through the deployment of new tools and processes we will maintain a dedicated team to continue to lead this work and well also remain flexible to adjustments and additions to the overall program this work serves as our north star as we prioritize future investments and determine needs to continue to differentiate synovus in what is becoming an increasingly competitive landscape we also recognize the uncertainty in the environment and the subsequent impact to financial results which may lead to a change in the scope and the sizing of the program and the management team is fully committed to execution and the delivery of the results with those comments now let me turn it back over to kessel to begin the qa portion of our program kessel d stelling chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp so thank you kevin and before i go to qa i just want to close by thanking our team i had the privilege last week of participating in our mortgage company town hall meeting where they were celebrating a quarter of not only record production but significant increases in customer satisfaction surveys and i said to them what ill say to our entire team today ive never been more proud to be associated with the synovus team and i continue to be inspired by not only what they do but how they do it putting our customers first in all that they do each and every day and in spite of all the challenges and uncertainties facing our industry we continue to attract and retain the very best talent in the industry and now operator id like to open the floor for questions synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from brady gailey from kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brady andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so i wanted to start with the expense base i mean on an adjusted point of view it was million this quarter you talk about expenses going down in the back half of the year maybe just talk about the magnitude of how much of the decline we could see there and then thats good news on the thirdparty spend million it seems like that was a little more than you all were anticipating and now youre looking at the branch side it feels like with the new backdrop of covid you can maybe find a little bit more than you were expecting there too maybe just talk about the possible upside on finding more expenses than initially expected other than synovus forward plan andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah brady hey its jamie good morning as we look at expenses in the second half of this year there are lot of ebbs and flows we do expect expenses to be lower that would be predominately led by personnel expense declines thats also assuming that mortgage revenues dont stay at the high levels we experienced in the second quarter but we expect that to normalize as well as you mentioned we continue to focus on real estate we closed six branches in the first half of the year and were expecting to close another seven in the second half of the year so were active there and were also reviewing our nonbranch real estate as you are aware were all learning a lot about how to use nonbranch real estate in this environment and so were reassessing everything these days and we believe that there are opportunities there youre right on the thirdparty spend initiative that has performed better than expected were always pleased when we can find additional cost saves in thirdparty spend and weve done that those days will come in over the next few quarters theyre not immediate just because some of the contracts they dont renew immediately and so well see that come in over the next few quarters but were very pleased with that we still believe that the expense save range of million to million makes sense for synovus forward but i will say that were constantly reassessing this is an evolving environment were looking at longer term into synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 and performance the performance outlook and our strategies will evolve as the environment evolves i will just remind that we came up with synovus forward and launched it in a very different operating environment we had a growing economy and the outlook has changed significantly and so as outlook changes our strategies will change and so you should expect to see that brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then my second last question is just on the dividend with the stock trading with a dividend yield it just continues to be a big investor focus if you look at reported earnings of this quarter and just a great quarter it feels like you should be more comfortable with the dividend after is that a fair assumption andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah brady we are comfortable with our dividend but weve as you know we look at it in two different capacities we look at capital adequacy and we look at longterm earnings and the payment ratio and so with capital adequacy as i look at where we are today were right at our cet1 target that target is informed by stress testing and if you look at severe adverse scenarios over a ninequarter period we expect capital degradation of around we also took a look at losses in the most recent dfast results and put those on our portfolio at the product level and you come up with a similar capital degradation when you look at that kind of external view so we feel good about a cet1 but what ill say is that when we ran our stress test and that capital degradation we didnt have near the allowance that we have today and so weve built this allowance while maintaining capital and we ended the quarter at but as i mentioned in the prepared remarks the transactions that have closed and settled since quarterend will add approximately another basis points to common equity tier and so we feel really good about where we are with regards to capital at this stage and then with regards to earnings and the payout ratio we believe that its appropriate to have to total payout ratio we want to retain capital for growth we believe very strongly in the opportunity for synovus in the southeast and we organic capital generation is the best way to have capital to go out there and grow customers and grow the bank so we want to retain capital generated through earnings for growth but we also believe that investors have the right and desire of current income and so we weigh both of those we look at our forecast and we look at our total payout ratio and our dividend payout ratio and dividend payout ratio is elevated versus our targets over the foreseeable future but it is not restrictive of our strategic plan and so we feel good about where we are brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the color guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah operator the next question comes from ken zerbe from morgan stanley please go ahead synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks i guess a really quick question in terms of slide obviously the amount of deferrals that you expected of round two were significantly less than what they are in round one but can you talk about the lost content when we think about those roundtwo deferrals obviously they are the weaker credits that asking for more time does the loss content presumably go up dramatically on those or how are you thinking about that thanks robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yeah hi ken this is bob ill try to answer that on the strategic industries or covidsensitive industries that kevin pointed out but when you start thinking about loss content i mean clearly we are modeling various scenarios there but back to kevins point about cash flows in his comments early indications are that our sensitive book has moved back closer to the breakeven cash flow line so again you start thinking about how do you model and run various scenarios so clearly hotels and shopping centers from a cre perspective we believe would be the most impacted when you think about looking at third and fourth quarter looking at these second deferrals from a loss content specifically obviously i dont i cant give you a complete estimate but were modeling various scenarios and feel good about where we are today as it relates to those portfolios kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah and ken ill just add bob mentioned some of the analysis were doing when you look at it at a broad level we only have a very small percentage of our customers that would have a cash financing need in the next to days and thats where were evaluating whether itd be additional stimulus that would come from the government or whether it would be the existing plans through main street lending or other bridge facilities that would bridge that gap so to bobs point its a very small percentage and when you look at the cash inflows and how theyve come back in june its really going to be a waitandsee as we look into the future and see what july august and september hold for many of these industries and what would happen if there is a surge in cases and there would be a return to lower levels of cash inflow so bob said it well its unknown at this point but we do feel like we ringfence the risk and we have a good estimate of where the risk is coming from and were doing everything we can now to mitigate that ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then just my followup question staying with credit i think jamie mentioned had a sentence in his prepared remarks that essentially said the acl could remain elevated and essentially might not fully offset future chargeoffs i get it if the economy deteriorates from here that totally makes sense but given cecl like your chargeoff should more than cover all your reserve should cover all your anticipated chargeoffs that you do expect given todays expectation and weve certainly heard from other banks one in particular said that they think the second quarters the peak in their reserve ratio and it should start to decline given what theyre expecting is there anything different with your portfolio that or is that sort of a throwaway synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 comment that provisions that reserves arent going to fully cover chargeoffs i just want to make sure i dont misread that in any way andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp ken its jamie youre thinking about it exactly right that comment is just really is around the uncertainty in this environment obviously we believe that our allowance today covers us for the chargeoffs embedded in our book life of loan losses and so we feel good about that however its just highly uncertain and we will be constantly reassessing that as we go through the next few quarters by looking at both economic outlook and risk rating migration ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you operator the next question comes from jared shaw from wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess sticking with on the deferral renewals are you able to get any type of concessions or enhancements more broadly from the loans that are going to be going into the second round of deferrals i guess how are you looking at actually approaching the renewals whether its in the covidsensitive industries or whether its just more broadly robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yeah hey jared this is bob just a quick comment on the deferral process that i think can add some color to that for you that process obviously does entail us addressing each credit on a loanbyloan basis certainly on the larger wholesale accounts in that process we clearly are looking at modifications to the note changes to the collateral changes to recourse et cetera so you get sort of a reunderwriting to some degree effect on that credit it also gets a refresh on risk grade et cetera and kind of to jamies point earlier theres migration involved there too so its a pretty detailed look at a specific credit in order to grant a second deferral now some of the smaller credits to kevin blairs point earlier were using a lot of data analytics that is helping us drive those decisions for second deferral so its lot harder to do deep dives on the smaller portfolios but were also not just granting them without looking at some data as well synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp so to your point were getting guarantees where it makes sense were taking extra collateral were getting fees so not only are we protecting ourselves from a risk standpoint were trying to benefit the pl at the same time jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then on that risk migration that you mentioned so on some of those we could potentially see some incremental level of chargeoff at the renewal of the deferral if that underwriting or those values didnt hold up robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yeah jared i guess this is bob again i think theoretically you could but remember were still early in the process and i think we did see some migration in our rated book as you saw but with the amount of liquidity out there and what were seeing and talking specifically with our customers particularly our larger accounts is that that will probably be a few quarters down the road before we begin to see to what level chargeoffs begin to materialize jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then i guess my second question could you give a little more detail on the securities repositioning where youre seeing where youre reinvesting cash flows at this point andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah jared this is jamie with the securities portfolio as we look we came into the second quarter interest rates obviously declined if you looked at the mortgage refinancing index it was spiking we had our own production was increasing and we looked at the portfolio and we had a significant amount of securities in the portfolio where we saw elevated prepay risk and we had a gain unrealized gain on those securities and we decided that it was better to take those gains realize them move that income forward and reduce prepay risk and so we did that in the securities portfolio if you look at the portfolio at quarterend the book yield was approximately the going on yield for new investments these days is approximately and so thats the rationale behind the transaction we will continuously evaluate that portfolio and look at market dynamics as we think about how to manage it going forward but thats the background on that jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then with the duration of new purchases is youre not changing i guess the tenor of new purchases andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp not significantly we did extend duration a little bit on new purchases synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator the next question comes from brad milsaps from piper sandler please go ahead brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brad andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey kevin i just wanted you to maybe talk a little bit more about the slide but i thought that was interesting just want to make sure i clearly understand this covers about of your loan portfolio and its really based on changes and sort of kind of what youre looking at in terms of operating deposit accounts or are you actually looking at realtime cash flow statements from customers to drive the data thats on slide just wanted to kind of understand that a little more clearly kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah brad its the former so were looking at their operating accounts to evaluate what the cash inflows are and quite frankly the outflows in those accounts and so we use that information its transactionlevel data the reason its is thats where we dont felt comfortable with having the full relationship to be able to look at all the inflows and outflows and as you stated it gives us an opportunity to look at the static environment so we saw in june that there was only a reduction in inflows across the entire book and i think it shows you that weve done a good job of identifying those loans that needed a deferment and that they were still down and those that didnt need a deferment the inflows were down only now this is one side of the equation obviously each of these businesses can be constraining their outflows so it doesnt mean that necessarily that its a drop to the bottom line and as jamie talked about in his prepared remarks weve actually seen an augmentation of deposit balances over this timeframe of roughly on average balances so it shows you even though inflows are slowing during the crisis people are able to slow their outflows as well whats most important about this data and bob mentioned it earlier is with the thousands of accounts that we have that we cant go do what youre suggesting the cash burn analysis which we are doing on the larger credits synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 this allows us to look at the static position but then most importantly predict into the future knowing what the recovery rate per industry is going to be and so we can know days or longer months out where theres going to be a shortfall in the cash flow and we can take action today so its good information this static just know that the most important part of it is the predictive abilities of having all that transactional data to be able to take early action brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co is this something relatively new for synovus or is it things that kind of you maybe relied on the past that are maybe from your experience at suntrust or jamie coming from regions kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp its new we leveraged as i mentioned on synovus forward we had an analytical work stream that we were starting that was largely focused on salesandservicetype initiatives and we rediverted those resources to take all of our analytical resources internally and a third party to develop out this predictive model during the second quarter so its new and the good news is brad its going to not only serve as a great platform for credit analytics that same transactional data will allow us to do service and sales leads and other types of relationshipbuilding predictive modeling that will be coming in the latter half of the year brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great and then just one final followup related to margin jamie you mentioned over the next several quarters getting interestbearing deposit cost down to the third quarter levels do you feel like this environment and kind of where you are with the florida franchise will kind of allow you to sort of equate those two deposit bases to one another in other words bring that mix more in line with legacy synovus in terms of cost or is florida market where you still have to pay up to some degree to continue to use funding andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah first as you look at mix we have largely achieved returning to the prefcb synovus deposit mix and so were pretty pleased with that and we included a chart showing the relative cost to our third quarter lows really did show where the opportunity lies and its in our time deposit book when we look at our core time deposits we have billion that mature in the second half of this year the average rate on those maturities is somewhere around our going on rate on time deposits is over basis points lower and so we do have line of sight into how we are going to attack that deposit cost its largely in the time deposit book i mentioned core time deposits we also have the opportunity in public funds we also have the opportunity in broker time and then theres still some opportunity left in interestbearing transaction deposits but the larger opportunity is in time deposits brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thank you synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah operator the next question comes from jennifer demba from suntrust please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc two questions you mentioned your net chargeoffs this quarter were driven by largely by one credit what industry was that in and what was the severity of loss on that loan and then my second question is can you share with us your criticized loan levels in your more pandemicsensitive loans that you outlined in the deck thanks robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yeah hey jennifer its bob as jamie mentioned that was one credit it was in aviation weve been working through that credit now for a few quarters we think we recognize the loss content and goes through our normal impairment process et cetera so we dont want to talk about specific credits but that ones flowing through the normal process as it relates to your question about migration and the sensitivity or the sensitive industries within that migration obviously thats there is some correlation there to our increase in criticized indiscernible would correlate somewhat back to mainly the hotel and shopping center portfolio as i mentioned earlier specifically in terms of what percentage i couldnt tell you but it is a little bit correlated there we expect that to continue but as kevin blair mentioned we think weve got a pretty good ring fence around those aggregate dollars and well go through our modeling to kind of predict that out as it flows forward but were taking the charge through the acl as you know today with the cecl reserve jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks so much operator the next question comes from john pancari from evercore isi please go ahead rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 yes this is rahul patil on behalf of john just had a question on the reserve how much of that million reserve is allocated to the cre portfolio and how much of the reserve was released tied to the student and the greensky loans move to held for sale andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah as you look at the student loan transaction that was approximately million in allowance release associated with that portfolio and so when you think about our total provision or total provision cost in the quarter we would have assumed that you would had the incremental million build on that what was the other part of your question rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc yeah how much of the total reserve was allocated to the cre portfolio andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp we have not disclosed that rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc okay and then just one question on the on expenses just thinking about it little differently so the adjusted efficiency ratio has hovered around to in the first half of this year in the past youve talked about in longer term efficiency target probably in the low to mid range you obviously have the revenue and the expense initiatives ongoing when do you expect to reach that level in terms of efficiency ratio or do you have like an updated target for us andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah let me just run through the different components of that to give an idea of how were looking at it because its a highly uncertain environment and so we have not updated or put targets out there updated targets for this environment so when you look at revenue and ill just start with interest income were forecasting the margin when you incorporate the basis point impact of the transactions weve discussed and then you exclude the impact of ppp we expect the margin to be flat but when you think about interest income over the second half of the year it will likely be up due to the forgiveness of ppp loans and so i would expect interest income in the second half of the year to be higher we would expect fee revenue nir to be down and we would expect that to be just because the first half of the year was so strong specifically in mortgage and so when you look at total revenue i would say flat to slightly up for the second half of the year and then as weve discussed we expect expenses to be down as we get to the longer term were committed to topquartile performance to delivering a strong return for our shareholders but were not at a spot to say what our target is or where we expect to be longer term rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 right thank you operator the next question comes from garrett holland from baird please go ahead garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc good morning thanks for taking the questions and appreciate all the detail this morning just to followup on that last one jamie theres clearly a number of moving pieces with ppp fees excess liquidity and the deposit or pricing opportunity how do you expect nii excluding ppp fees to trend over the back half of the year and where do you think its stabilizes andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah my expectation for the second half of the year is that nii is higher inclusive of ppp fees when you back those out however i would go back to the margin guidance and basically say that when you include ppp fees were going to have a basis points headwind due to the transactions weve discussed and then we have offsetting the headwinds from fixed rate asset repricing and the tailwinds of deposit repricing and we think those are going to net to a push therell also be a benefit we had an average of approximately billion of cash at the fed in the second quarter we expect that to be lower thats not certain but we would expect that to be a tailwind to the margin wont impact nii but those are the moving pieces as we think about nii in the second half of the year garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc thats helpful thank you and then just quickly i guess what pressure does the pandemic operating backdrop put on the timing for synovus forward benefit clearly theres better visibility for thirdparty expense and real estate savings but do you feel good about your flexibility to increase those expense synergies if the revenue benefits dont materialize kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah ill take that garrett this is kevin look weve said its a very flexible and scalable program where we evaluated over different initiatives during the diagnostic phase we decided to move forward with several expense reduction initiatives that we call funding the journey obviously we believe in the second half of this year and early next year we believe theres opportunities to generate incremental revenues weve talked about the million to million range we remain confident in that and those initiatives really revolve around analytics and pricing for value but as you know the top line and the initiatives are to generate million in pretax income so as certain initiatives will ebb and flow were going to be able to adjust on both sides of the ledger whether its revenue or expense and im equally as optimistic as we have announced on this first initiative on the thirdparty spend that the rest of our efficiency initiatives will be successful and im optimistic that many of the revenue initiatives will also be successful but as jamie mentioned earlier based on the environment overall we may have to scale up the program in general but well continue to keep a dedicated team focused on it and well have a focus not only towards the synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 financial objectives but also the prioritization of future investments and making sure that were continuing to enhance the team member and the customer experience garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc thanks kevin operator the next question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning this is anthony elian on for steve i had a question on kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning i had a question on credit a couple of your southeast peers in recent days have called out one off chargeoffs in restaurant and energy i just wanted to get a sense of anything of note you guys are seeing in either of these portfolios understand that there is small composition of your overall loan portfolio but just wanted to see if theres anything of note that youre seeing robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yes thanks this is bob again on specifically on energy that portfolio is relatively small i think we disclosed it in less than million range we havent seen any specific credit degradation there most of our exposure is not related to exploration and production its more related to transportation and support industries and then specifically i think on the restaurants that you called out a lot of our portfolio is drive through quick servetype restaurants most of those are smaller ones we probably will see some credit migration in that portfolio but thats a book thats primarily built around our community bankers its built around customers that weve known for a long time in our markets and we feel like were really close and talking to those customers on a routine basis and feel okay about where we are but certainly in that portfolio you could see that credit migrate over a period of time kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp and iii just draw your attention to slide and in the appendix where we give you the quarter to date metrics both on restaurant and the oil industry so you can reference that anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 okay and one followup for me of the billion of core transaction deposit growth we saw in the quarter how much of this came from nonppp activity and can you estimate what percentage of these balances are sticky in nature thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah its difficult to attribute the deposit growth exactly but we would say that i think we can tie about billion billion to ppp borrowing and as we look at it and this is not comprehensive but we would say that somewhere between and of the cash from ppp has been utilized and so its less than we would originally imagine at the beginning of the program but thats where it currently stands the stickiness of the deposits for the second half of this year is difficult to model just because this is pretty unprecedented in a new environment and so we are remaining conservative on how we manage the balance sheet how we look at cash on the balance sheet and expected outflows but its our expectation that these balances do remain on the balance sheet for the next couple of quarters kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp and jamie if i could just add one more point to that in ppp obviously were going to get some balances that leave us but the other important part we have this is also in the appendix we were able to generate new relationships from the ppp program and although it originated only million in ppp balances weve been able to garner a full relationship from those new customers and so there will be balances that come to us that will not leave so not only will we be able to take advantage of the ppp program and the fees from that but weve now generated almost new relationships as a result anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you operator the next question comes from steven duong from rbc capital markets please go ahead steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp hi steven andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hi steven steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 just on the capital degradation under your stress test the so if that was to occur that would take your cet1 to say the low to mid7 if you were to assume that you to build the cet1 next few quarters is that a range that you guys would be willing you want to still keep the dividend if it got to say around a level andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp steven as we think about capital and how do we manage in that adverse environment i mean thats a hypothetical scenario that if we had perfect foresight our dividends generate about basis point common dividend is about basis points of capital per year and so thats about the impact of if you were to pivot from a quarter down to or to zero and so its not tremendously material obviously in a severe adverse scenario where youre taking your hands off the wheel like the stress tests assume you wont every piece of capital but at basis points per year is not tremendous if you had perfect foresight and you saw a scenario like that happening where earnings were depressed for an extended period of time obviously we would consider our dividend policy but as weve shown in the first half this year the stress test assumptions of total hands off the wheel around managing your own balance sheet are not accurate with what we would do you can see by our actions in the second quarters that were going to actively manage our balance sheet we have the means and the ability to improve capital and manage capital through adverse environments and you see that with the student loan sale you see us generating capital and building reserves at the same time and so we feel good about that and i think thats how we would look at this severe adverse scenario which is its not too dissimilar from how we look at the balance sheet today were focused on accreting capital today steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah that was i mean its really great to see this quarter that the amount of capital you guys were able to generate and then just a followup to that after we get through this credit cycle we are in a really firstofakind interest rate environment i guess how does how are you guys thinking about the future margin and your ppnr and able to maintain your dividend based on that andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah as we look at longer term as ive said weve given guidance of the margin being flat once you adjust for that basis points for the transaction as excluding ppp and we believe that we have opportunities on the liability side to offset the kind of persistent pressure we will get due to fixed rate assets both mortgage loans and mortgage securities repricing over time and so when we think about our margin we see it as fairly stable given those inputs and assumptions and we look at the balance sheet we expect loans to be fairly flat over the second half of the year and so those are our core assumptions for nii we believe nir we still have the teams and the customer base to have strong growth there and so we think about ppnr or just total revenue we feel its either strength in nir nii we expect will have a combination of a fairly flat margin and truthfully fairly flat loans for second half of the year kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp and jamie ill give you jamie gave you some of the financial response but i would just add from a business standpoint we feel like were wellsituated in the southeast to continue to grow once we get to your point on the synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 other side of this environment we think that weve been able to add talent in the last several years that was proving out in the first quarter before we hit the pandemic that we were seeing elevated levels of growth and so im very confident in our banks ability to continue to take share and win business and thats going to be the differentiator in this world that we live in if its a flat rate environment everyones going to be sitting there with lower margins and so those banks that can generate growth through acquisition and customers and expansion are going to be the ones that outperform and were confident well be able to do that steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right great to hear and thanks again for everything for all the information operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess the question actually for kessel you mentioned that kessel youve been through a lot i think shareholders whove been with synovus in the last decade have been through a lot also the recovery coming out of the last crisis id love to get your thoughts as the chairman of the board around the dividend i appreciate the dividend payout ratio and targeting to there could be a chance you remain at a much higher level for the foreseeable future but if youre a shareholder of the company it feels like theres a lot of judgment call that would be involved and id love to get your thoughts around again if the macro gets much worse for the entire industry i get that but if it doesnt it seems like your messaging is creating a lot more idiosyncratic risk around synovus dividend outlook id love for you to address that kessel kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah ebrahim i think i got most of that question and happy to do that and thanks for calling on because our team was starting to think i was not a participant today so thank you for that look as chairman of the board i am totally in sync and connected with the message that jamie just delivered as a matter of fact i think sunday morning at am jamie kevin and i were on a call looking at not just this year next year looking at some of the same test that the fed has laid out for larger banks in terms of a rolling fourquarter average testing the sensitivity around that payout both as again as it affects capital ratios and as it reflects on a percentage of again longterm earnings so you mentioned yeah if the industry went into a severe depression i think all bets would be off for all of us or at least for most of us but today and we present that same analysis to our board ive noticed several of our peers talked about the board is expected to approve our board is very well informed and as chairman my synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 obligation is to make sure that we present not only jamies base case but present the scenarios that could call that into question over the long term so i mean i would love to be able to give total clarity over the next three or four years i think today i think weve laid out well based on conditions today based on the quality of our credit the build of our reserve the capital levels our ability to flex this quarter and quite frankly beyond to make sure that capital ratios stay at well capitalized levels jamie mentioned another basis points already this quarter in cet1 based on actions taken to date so again totally in lockstep we dont have a management view and a board view but i again as chairman make sure our board sees not just our analysis but the board is very well informed by thirdparty investment banks that run their own models their own stress test their own scenarios so today again we feel confident in the level of the dividend but as again i think all of my peers have said on every call there is a lot of uncertainty in the market over the long term so well continue to update investors every quarter on our view and certainly if it were to change we would inform not only on this call but every opportunity we get transparency has always been very key to us and i hope from jamies explanation and mine you feel that were happy to follow up but totally in sync with jamie kevins comments again on credit on capital and on dividend ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc no so i think that was helpful thank you and just very quick followup jamie that the cet1 ph its not the highest but its a pretty healthy level what do you expect for the cet1 to trend like do you think that ratio goes higher from here and are there other actions that you could do to further shore up the capital ratios if you needed to andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah ebrahim cet1 could go higher from here we would expect it to just through core earnings thats our number one source of capital and as we look forward we assume that our allowance today is appropriate and when you think about if your allowance if youre not having significant allowance bills its really through ppnr and ive given kind of the breakdown of how we view ppnr in the second half of the year so yes we are not repurchasing shares for the rest of the year we are forecasting positive earnings and growth there and so we feel good about organic capital generation in the second half of the year i would also point to while it is not our plan we do still have million in unrealized gains in the securities portfolio so were not intending to transact there but as i mentioned thats something that we continuously evaluate and theres a strong rationale to reposition the portfolio we may end up with more gains realized gains and so i would say those are the larger considerations there ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it i know its been a long call thanks for taking my questions kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 thanks operator the next question comes from christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning and just a quick question on the mortgage business and the sort of infrastructure spending youve done already i know that this quarter was great and may not be sustainable but i feel like youve made a lot of investments to kind of position yourself well for the long term so i just wanted to go through that real quick kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp so as you think about mortgage obviously about of the volume this quarter was refinances chris so that will abate somewhat going forward we knew that there was an increase when we think about what weve been able to invest in over the last several years as i said in the prepared remarks weve been able to add mortgage loan originators over the last two years that we think are critical for our future success we have about million at quarterend and so you do the math on that they did about million per lo last quarter so that will come back a little bit the other just based on the volume from a refinance perspective but the other wildcard is just understanding what the secondary gains are going to be in the market in the third quarter we had about in margin this quarter that was a bit elevated from what we had expected so i think when you go to third quarter you will still see a very strong production quarter well have to watch margins and that will ultimately determine what the secondary gains will be in the third quarter but theyll come down from the elevated levels i think jamie said the second quarter was really a record level and its something that we dont expect to see for the latter part of it this year christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great kevin thanks for that and jamie just a quick one on the deposit mix as you cited back on slide does the change in the cd mix kind of take a couple more quarters to get where you wanted to go or how whats the proper timeframe to expect there andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah itll take a few quarters i would extend it a little more than a couple but ill just point you back to the billion that we do have maturing year in the second half of the year thats a significant piece of it but youre right they do extend into christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay really good thanks again for all the information this morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 yeah thank you kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp thank you kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks chris operator the next question comes from michael rose from raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey just a followup on total adjusted fee income understand the moving parts and i appreciate the answer to chris question as i look at some of the other line items so like service charges and bank card fees i would expect those to continue to normalize from fee waivers and card activity stuff like that jamie should we think about fee income on an adjusted basis actually being relatively flattish as we move into the third quarter would that be your expectation thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp my expectation is actually that it declines in the third quarter and thats really based on mortgage this quarter in mortgage had just under million in revenue was unprecedented and just to put a box around that the mortgage team produced billion in mortgage total when you include indiscernible weve grown the portfolio that billion was larger that individual quarter was larger than of the last years so this is really an unprecedented quarter for the team there and we dont expect that to continue and so as i look forward total fee revenue my expectation today is that mortgage revenue trends back towards a longerterm mean which is actually a somewhat material reduction and so thats a large i agree with your other comments i would say that we would expect card activity to increase if you look at just kind of core bank fees and nsf thats challenging in this environment because theres so much liquidity and so were not seeing a lot of nsf fees and capital markets income and the rest we would expect to be fairly stable to growing but the third quarter will see a reset from the second quarter michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay very helpful and then maybe a broader question for kessel as we do get to side of this credit cycle and there is a kind of a reintermediation of loans into the banking system from nonbank lenders given the struggles there how do you make sure that synovus gets its fair share while at the same time keep an eye on costs and reduce some branch footprint and overhead employees stuff like that kind of what how do you see kind of the synovus story evolving and making sure that you have a growing place in this world thanks kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 yeah michael great question and again we question ourselves on that every day let me start by saying this we believe our business model works well and is evidenced by the results not just this quarter but the entire year and its not just evidenced by results which i think speak for themselves but our ability to attract and retain talent whether youve been with our company years or days in some cases involving someone i was involved in recruiting last week we continue in my opinion with all due respect to our peers to attract some of the best talent in our major metro markets here in atlanta in jacksonville in south florida and really throughout so the model our gotomarket strategy is working well our talent i think is the best in the industry i mean they want to work for our company and i think is evidenced the ppp process again everybody try their best so theres no judgment on who did better than others but i do think kevin mentioned new relationships that was evidenced of although sometimes in our industry people think of us as a commodity i think when times really get tough and you get into a ppptype process our relationshipbased model and way of doing business really stood out as customers didnt want to feel like they had gone into nevernever land they wanted a banker who could talk to them about process where are you why are you there what can you expect so whether its through increasing digital channels or making sure our branch network is optimized with the right talent or again our middle market teams our wholesale teams our specialty lending teams again great talent led by the original leadership team from global one theyve expanded their leadership in our company and again adding i think true expertise in areas that stand out end of the day customers want to be banked by someone who knows their business very well and i think our model allows us to get the right banker in front of the right customer or prospect and over time add value and quite frankly get paid for that value so were confident in the goforward model we want to get through this cycle we want to continue to focus on credit on efficiency on revenue opportunities but were excited about and beyond recognizing the challenges of a low for long interest rate environment we think we have a competitive edge and we just got to build on that and maximize that opportunity michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc i appreciate all the color thanks guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks michael andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thanks michael operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr kessel stelling for any closing remarks thank you kessel d stelling chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp well thank you its been a long call but a few comments to close up again the call today referencing the pandemic and social unrest and its hard to believe it was almost two months ago when all of us witnessed the senseless murder of george floyd in our own state we saw video the tragic killing of ahmaud arbery and since synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 then ive had countless conversations with community leaders mentors of mine board members advisory board members and synovus leaders from the executive leadership team to the teller line and while many of those calls were filled with very raw emotion all were filled with hope and encouragement for what we could do on a go forward
