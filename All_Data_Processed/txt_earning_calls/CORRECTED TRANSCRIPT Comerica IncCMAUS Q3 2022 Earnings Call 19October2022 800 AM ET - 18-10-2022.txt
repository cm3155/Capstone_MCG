critical to achieving continued success lets review the highlights of our third quarter results on slide following second quarter significant loan growth third quarter activity remained strong average loans were up billion reflecting increases across a number of businesses the largest being commercial real estate national dealer services environmental services and wealth management commercial real estate benefited from the continued build out of projects and the pace of payoffs normalizing due to the rate environment we have made selective investments to expand our wealth management business and we are excited to see the growth and momentum this quarter other business lines saw merger and acquisition activity and continued investment in working capital albeit at a slower pace in the second quarter we continue to strategically manage deposits as customers draw down on their operating accounts and seek higher yielding products for excess balances we made significant progress on our hedging strategy which should help insulate earnings through rate cycles yet we maintained most of the benefit from higher rates which combined with the growth in our loan and securities portfolios drove a record net interest income credit quality remained excellent and fee income is strong with increased derivative activity expenses were driven by our performance based compensation and investments to support growth our efficiency ratio further improved to as a result of record revenue and a solid expense management retention of earnings drove our cet ratio back up to an estimated overall an excellent quarter and we feel very positive about the trajectory of our business as we move through the remainder of the year and now ill turn the call over to jim who will review the quarter in more detail james j herzog chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide as curt mentioned we continue to have broad based loan growth with balances increasing billion favorable environmental factors and demonstrated expertise across a number of our specialty businesses drove our ph outstandings higher also loan commitment reduction was very strong which can be a good indicator of future loan growth as of quarter end comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 loan commitments increased almost billion or which outpaced loan draws resulting in a small decline in line utilization to about loans in our commercial real estate business increased to over million as we funded construction of projects nearly all of the growth was in class a multifamily or industrial projects built by large developers that we know well providing significant equity contributions credit quality in this business is excellent criticized loans remain extremely low and we see no meaningful signs of negative migration national dealer services loans continue to slow rebound and grew over million this includes a million increase in floor plan loans to million however inventory levels remain low and these balances are well below our precovid run rate we havent benefiting from acquisition activity in this space we still believe it will take some time for inventory levels to rebuild as supply issues are resolves and pentup demand is satisfied growth in environmental services and corporate banking resulted from a combination of new customers ma as well as investment in working capital and capex wealth management had a strong quarter with loan growth in part due to customers taxrelated activities such as exchanges average loans in both equity fund services and mortgage banker finance were down and equity fund services following very strong growth in the past couple of quarters we saw it moderate early in the quarter but momentum resumed in periodend loans and total commitments were up mortgage banker average loans decreased million and million at quarter end significantly muting our total periodend balances volumes in that business remain depressed due to higher interest rates and lack of housing inventory loan yields increased basis points to primarily reflecting the benefit from higher rates in line with expectations slide shows our average deposits continued to decline customers put their excess liquidity to work and we prudently managed pricing related to nonrelationshipbased deposits in highly rate sensitive segments we continued to see the largest decreases in our interestbearing deposits particularly in financial services financial institutions and corporate banking businesses our strategy through this cycle has been to balance deposit pricing with our liquidity needs while most importantly retaining our customer relationships we have taken an agile and customized approach to finding that right balance our mix remains favorable at noninterest bearing reflecting the relationship and operational nature of our deposits our overall liquidity position is strong with a loan to deposit ratio at which is well below our historical average we have significant capacity to support loan growth including efficient borrowing channels available such as broker deposits or federal home loan bank lines which we began utilizing at the end of the quarter interest bearing deposit costs remained low at basis points with a year todate beta of only we do not expect to achieve a cumulative beta of until sometime next year of course the ultimate cumulative beta will depend on fomc monetary actions in addition to loan and deposit activity our securities portfolio continues to play an important role in achieving our asset sensitivity objectives slide demonstrates the significant growth in balances and yield over the past year quarteroverquarter average balances increased billion reflecting the full benefit of our second quarter purchases net of marktomarket adjustments higher rates resulted in a marktomarket of almost billion at periodend and this impact runs through oci and affects our book value but not our regulatory capital ratios while we maintain the portfolios available for sale mostly for liquidity purposes we typically hold these securities to maturity in which case the unrealized losses should not impact income comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 as another avenue to provide liquidity for loan growth we see securities purchases partway through the quarter which contributed to periodend balances declining to billion as the portfolio shrinks we plan to manage our asset sensitivity through additional swaps as needed over the past year weve concentrated our purchases in agency cmbs with a goal of delivering more consistent cash flows with an average duration of slightly over five years the larger average portfolio along with the favorable new purchase yields resulted in a million increase in securities income turning to slide net interest income increased million to a record million and the net interest margin increased basis points the benefit from higher rates lifted loan income million and added basis points to the margin although the rate environment has increased the cost of borrowing for our customers weve not seen a meaningful increase in competitive pressure on spreads loan growth added million and basis points one additional day in the quarter provided million as i mentioned the increase in the size of the securities portfolio at higher yields added million as far as deposits at the fed higher rates combined with lower balances added million and basis points to the margin higher rates in our floating rate wholesale debt in addition to our subordinated debt offering had a million impact altogether the rise in rates provided a net benefit of million to net interest income credit quality remained excellent as outlined on slide net charge offs were only basis points well below historical averages criticized nonaccrual loans also stayed low with the heightened economic uncertainty our allowance for credit losses increased modestly to of loans our provision increased to million as always we are closely monitoring the portfolio for signs of stress and are proactive in our credit management we have begun to see some signs of normalization in certain portfolios with our consistent disciplined approach as well as our relationship model and diverse customer base we believe were well positioned to manage through a recessionary environment noninterest income increased million or as outlined on slide deferred comp which is offset in expenses increased million and was still a headwind in absolute terms with a million negative return for the quarter overall fee generation remained strong led by growth in derivative income of million due to energy and interest rate related activity which included a million increase in favorable cva adjustments brokerage service fees grew as a result of increased money market funds revenue this growth was partially offset by reductions in fiduciary income and card fees annual tax fees received in the second quarter and market activity impacted fiduciary income and a decline in volumes affected card fees turning to expenses on slide our efficiency ratio improved percentage points to as we continued to maintain our expense discipline while revenue generation accelerates and we position for future growth salaries and benefits increased million primarily due to the million change in deferred compensation which is offset in noninterest income beyond deferred compensation we saw an increase in performance based incentives tied to our strong financial results of note our staff levels were stable as we successfully retain and attract talent in this competitive market occupancy expense increased million driven by seasonality and the new lease in our farmington hills location outside processing for our card programs largely driven by rate related pricing increased million weve made progress on certain modernization initiatives and incurred million in costs consistent with the second quarter expense as previously discussed this is a journey which includes transformation of a retail banking delivery model alignment of corporate facilities and technology optimization the cost savings generated are expected to be reinvested as we continue to evolve comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 slide provides details on capital management with record earnings our strong capital generation outpaced capital needed to support loan and commitment growth thus our cet1 ratio increased to an estimated as always our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive return to our shareholders we closely monitor loan and profitability trends as we balance maintaining our cet1 target of approximately with our dividend and share repurchase strategy our common equity declined in the third quarter as a result of the impact of oci losses from our securities and swap portfolios excluding the aoci losses our common equity per share increased a or over also note that our tangible common equity was however excluding aoci it increased to slide provides an update on our interest rate sensitivity over the past year we have been working to fulfill our strategy to lock in higher rates and achieve a strong and more predictable earnings stream through the rate cycle by reducing volatility to net interest income based on our standard model with a basis point decrease in rates over months we have achieved our target for a low single digit percent impact to net interest income and yet maintain some upside should rates continue to rise we are now focused on smoothing the periods further out to maintain our target level of sensitivity mainly through the purchase of forward dated swaps considering expected loan and deposit activity including some acceleration of our deposit pricing along with the september 30th forward curve we forecast net interest income to grow by to in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter fullyear is expected to exceed by more than we utilized our model to provide scenarios including a basis point gradual increase in rates over a 12month period which resulted in an approximate million increase in net interest income in addition we borrowed a catch up of a cumulative beta since when rates began to rise in march on top of the basis point up scenario which resulted in an estimated million headwind to net interest income of course there are many dynamics which may cause modeled results to differ from actual outcomes overall we believe our predictability of earnings provides us the ability to more consistently invest in our business and thereby grow customers and revenue and provides a more compelling investment thesis for our shareholders our outlook for the fourth quarter and fullyear is on slide and assumes a continuation of the current economic environment we are working on our financial plan and expect to provide our customary fullyear guidance during our fourth quarter conference call but i will offer some color as we go through each line item loan growth has been robust so far this year and we expect fullyear loan growth to exceed excluding ppp loans this includes our expectation for average loan growth of approximately in the fourth quarter positive trends are expected in most of our businesses in the fourth quarter however at a more moderate pace given the slowdown on economic activity mortgage banker is expected to continue to be a headwind assuming economic conditions do not change materially we expect continued solid growth into next year we expect deposit trends to continue as customers draw down on deposits to support their businesses and in some cases seek higher yielding options looking into next year the timing and the scale of deposit activity is expected to be highly influenced by fed tightening actions and the economic environment as discussed in the previous slide we project strong fourth quarter net interest income up to over our record third quarter as we think about we expect to benefit from higher rates and loan volume on the other hand deposit balances and pricing could put pressure on net interest income relative to the fourth quarter run rate regardless we expect net interest income to be at another alltime high next year comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 credit quality has been excellent and we expect it to remain strong in the fourth quarter therefore we forecast net charge offs at the lower end of our normal range of basis points to basis points we believe we will begin to see gradual normalization assuming the macroeconomic challenges remain manageable we expect fourth quarter noninterest income to decline approximately from strong third quarter levels we expect pressures on derivatives given recent elevated levels deposit service charges from higher eca rates a softening syndication market and equity trends may impact fiduciary revenue this is expected to be partly offset by positive seasonal trends in areas such as card as we look into we expect noninterest income to grow as we start to see the benefit of our investments we expect fourth quarter expenses to grow approximately to including expenses tied to revenue generating related activity such as outside processing for card in addition we expect seasonally higher occupancy advertising staff insurance as well as travel and entertainment expenses this outlook excludes up to million of modernization initiatives that we anticipate in the fourth quarter we believe these strategic investments in our business will deliver value over time and are essential in meeting the evolving needs of our customers and colleagues in we expect moderately higher staffing levels as the tight labor market eases and we continue to make progress in implementing our revenue strategies given the markets performance pension expense is likely to move significantly higher we also anticipate inflationary factors to impact many areas such as salaries and benefits along with higher fdic expense in summary based on our expectations for the fourth quarter and our performance todate we believe we will produce very strong and record revenue results this year we have driven robust loan growth and strong fee generation in addition we benefited from higher rates while executing our hedging strategy and careful management of credit and expenses we expect to carry our momentum into the fourth quarter and finish the year strong now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim many business lines are showing positive trends with strong loan growth in addition to increases in commitments and a very solid pipeline our unique expertise and credit culture provide us a steady foundation and help produce a record level of profitability while our investments in talent technology and markets facilitate continued growth to support our future management of our balance sheet allows us to benefit from rising rates by reducing the impact from lower rates which we believe will provide a more consistent earnings trajectory through the cycles it was a record quarter and i remain grateful for the continued commitment of my colleagues who are dedicated to ensure comericas success we believe we are wellpositioned to deliver strong results as we end the year and move into before we take questions i would like to recognize darlene persons who recently announced her retirement after a 36year career with our company years as director of investor relations one of the longest serving ir directors in the banking industry she has steered us through many cycles and her guide its not only to me and our leadership team but to our whole company has been invaluable id also like to introduce our new ir director kelly gage whos had an 18year career with us deep commercial banking background most recently comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 as the national director of sales and strategy for the commercial bank kelly will do a great job in her new role as ir director and i know youll look forward to getting to know her all right so with that wed be happy to take your questions and open up the line question and answer section operator operator instructions one moment please for our first question and our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning congrats darlene just want to say congratulations just a question for you jim on some of the comments where you talked about i know you dont want to go into too much but you talked about the potential for potential for nii pulling back a little bit from q4 can you help us understand that a little bit more and then just remind us of the overall goals of what you trying to do in this kind of rate environment in terms of the rate hedging james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah well good morning jon and thank you for the question i do think the fourth quarter run rate is a great starting point in terms of how to start thinking about there are reasons we could be a little bit below that there are reasons we could be a little above it if deposit betas catch up very quickly and on cumulative basis or exceed andor deposit runoff continues through i think we could be below that run rate on the other hand if deposit betas take some time to catch up say some time after the first quarter or through midyear and deposits start to level off the runoff starts to level off in the beginning of then i think theres a reasonable chance we could be above that run rate so i think it could go either direction there are just some open questions in terms of how deposit pricing will progress and how the runoff will progress over the next several quarters but again i would just say that i think the run rate in the fourth quarter is a pretty good place to start and just be aware that there are some factors that could potentially move that down but there is some upside to that also in terms of what were trying to accomplish i think the message has been consistent i think weve met the objectives that weve set we are trying to stabilize net interest income we feel like weve achieved that weve left a little bit to the upside if rates do continue to go up as we approach the peak here as i mentioned in my comments i dont think were going to be doing any hedging activity other than replacing securities that run off that would start in the next months if you look at in the appendix we have a little bit of a maturity curve of our swaps and from that you would infer that were really going to work on forward starters that might start in later eventually maybe even but we feel like weve taken care of business in the nearterm so we feel really good about the positioning weve essentially achieved by far in a way a record level of net interest income and at the same time partially protected that record level net interest income so i think weve gotten to where we want to be and were enjoying the fruits of that right now comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah thats fair i am surprised by the increase in the margin so that was nice to see and i guess one more question i think i know the answer to it but ive had a couple of emails back on my note this morning can you touch a little bit on your tangible common equity ratio and how you view that i know you may not think its a big deal but some people ask about it so can you just touch on how you think about that level james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah i continue to believe its an optic but nothing more than that as ive mentioned before from an economic standpoint the value of our deposits has gone up significantly offsetting if not more than offsetting that loss on securities and swaps so economically we like what were seeing you see that in the results in terms of the earnings as we stay in touch with various constituents everyone in this synoptic that everyone struggles to find really any substantial issue with it so its really not a point of concern for us and i just think its an odd looking optic given the unprecedented run up in interest rates and really nothing more than that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks jon curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks jon operator and our next question comes from the line of scott siefers please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey thank you for taking the question jim i wanted to ask about the deposit levels i think previously wed sort of been hoping the bulk of deposit runoff would finish in sort of fourth quarter or first quarter you guys still have a very very low loan to deposit ratio but i guess just curious on your thinking on sort of when or where we could see the deposits level out and at what point would you want to get more aggressive on pricing to protect those comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 balances in other words just a little more color on the sort of the push and pull between volume and rate in your view james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yes scott thank you for the question first of all ill say that i think were pretty comfortable with the pricing approach up to this point we obviously have a low yeartodate beta low beta for the quarter but being a primarily a commercial bank we feel like we do have these conversations with our customers and to the extent weve lost deposits its been very knowingly and we certainly havent lost any relationships and we have the ability to ramp up some of that exception pricing if we really need to we have raised our standard pricing on the retail side which touches retail and wealth customers so we feel real comfortable with the pricing approach but in terms of where deposit runoff goes i really think its going to be highly dependent on fed policy i think the combination of qt as well as the rising rates as you know those two factors will drive what happens in we obviously expect the runoff to continue through the fourth quarter at a similar pace that weve seen i do want to caveat that we could see some seasonal deposits in the fourth quarter as we often see seasonal trends have been rendered a little bit not as reliable over the last odd two or three years so it is possible we get some seasonal deposits that mute that runoff in the fourth quarter but i think that runoff would then just manifest in the first quarter i think it would be probably a temporary reprieve if we get those seasonal deposits but its still our outlook that things start to level off early in i do think the fed continues with qt for the next year yearandahalf as they plan to i guess its actually two years you could see some deposits continue to run off even after early but id like to remind people the fed never did fully unwind its qe from previous cycles it seems very plausible to me they wont fully unwind it this cycle youve already seen some literature in various industry magazines that there are some concerns by the regulators and the fed regarding just some of the deposit runoff at banks so at this point our house case is still it starts to level off in early and we certainly have plenty of efficient borrowing lines we have access to broker deposits we could even get more aggressive in conversations with our customers in terms of where they place their money so we feel like we have a lot of optionality there r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay wonderful thank you for that color and then was hoping you could also discuss the higher modernization costs in the fourth quarter will that be kind of a high watermark or would they continue much beyond the fourth quarter or sort of end with the end of this calendar year james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah thank you for that question i think thats an important one based on the initiatives that weve identified up till now i think the fourth quarter would be the high watermark and that assumes we set up to million theres always a chance some of these lease exits could be delayed till next year so my answer obviously is caveated based on the timing of when these actually happen but if they do happen in the fourth quarter of as we expect based on the initiatives weve identified this would be the high watermark having said that there could be some additional initiatives that we identify over time were always talking about some of the potentials out there but this one will be a little bit more of an outsized one and could be the high watermark comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right thank you very much for taking the questions james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks for the questions scott operator and our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc ebrahim good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning good morning i guess maybe just first question i know banks are not really seeing anything in terms of credit pain yet but give us a sense of like the fed indiscernible interest rates obviously its benefiting loan yields right now but how are customers kind of absorbing these like are you worried about what this may mean as we look out into next year in terms of just the ability of your customer base to live with to fed funds rate and just the level of visibility you have there in terms of all of a sudden seeing a big drop off in how customers are able to service their debt james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc so it sounds like the question is the ability of our customers to withstand the economic pressures of the higher rates from a credit standpoint melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah this is melinda i would say that overall we feel really good about our customers ability to kind of manage through the current interest rate environment every time we do an underwriting we stress interest rates whether were in a low rate environment or a high rate environment and we think we do a really nice job of making sure that whatever the debt load is of the customer that theyve got the ability to manage through that we also have a relatively low leverage book overall so the actual leverage portfolio would be the one that were watching really closely obviously given their debt levels they are more sensitive but we also use strategies like swaps and fixing rates in order to make sure that we can protect the cash flow and the companys ability to kind of repay the debt so overall i think we feel really good about our customers ability to navigate the environment ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it how big is that leverage book comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc little over billion ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc billion and just want to follow up jim on the asset side we saw about basis points increase quarterover quarter just talk to us in terms of how you see that asset yields trending going from year in terms of any spread compression that you expect or the basis points relative to the rate hikes we saw in the third quarter that should hold for the next few quarters james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah i think these metrics will largely hold up this was struck on ph as a model run and as deposits run off you could see a little bit of movement in those calculations but i think the rule of thumb will hold pretty well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc do you expect that yields to behave consistent with third quarter james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc im sorry expect what ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc do you expect asset yields loan yield repricing to be consistent with what we saw in the third quarter james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc no loan yields will continue to go up in the fourth quarter over the third quarter ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and what are the investment yields in the securities book relative to whats maturing james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc oh yeah im sorry well we are not buying securities as i mentioned at this time we are letting the securities run off theyre running off kind of in that ph range just slightly above the overall portfolio average so i expect securities yields to stay pretty flat i mean you could see some very minor yield movement down quartertoquarter but its going to be almost unnoticeable i think given how close the runoff is to the overall portfolio yield comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning just wondering if i get a little bit more detail on slide i know you broke out that you see a million nii benefit under your standard model but assuming a cumulative at the beta you could see a million nii decline pretty notable delta between the two and is that maybe can you walk us through the puts and takes is it primarily just the beta assumption or are there other aspects there that led to such a noteworthy swing thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc that is the beta assumption thats driving that so if you do the math the beta obviously is having a million impact relative to the basis points up so thats how you swing from million positive to million negative we did have that cumulative beta kind of feathering in over the months so if it came as a shock it could even be higher but it is important to note that in our fourth quarter guidance we actually have a lot of this cumulative beta in there in fact we get up to about a cumulative beta by the end of the fourth quarter so i think you can take some assurance by the fact that our guidance already has about half of this cumulative beta in it already so youve probably you got the other half of the cumulative beta you probably closer to zero as opposed to this negative million so just some additional color for you there john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thanks and just a quick followup to ebrahims question you mentioned that youre letting securities run off but are you just to clarify are you reinvesting the cash flows back into the bond book and what are those reinvestment yields james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah to be clear we are not reinvesting them into the bond book we are using this run off to fund our loan growth which we expect to continue to stay strong and so for the probably for the next for the foreseeable future at least we will not be buying securities we think this is the most efficient way to fund our loan growth comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay got it and then if i could just ask one more back to the tce topic i know that you indicated that its more optic from your point of view so given that how low are you willing to let that tce to ta ratio go below that level where its at now and does that influence you in any way at all when it comes to buyback interest when it comes to repurchases thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah you know i mean large its largely out of our control of course you know based on where interest rates go and how low that goes but i can tell you there is no magical number that we are focused on and i would just reiterate that we dont think its a concern we dont think it should be a concern of others and again i just think its an oddity of the times that were seeing this type of movement not just at comerica but to some extent at other banks too john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it thanks jim james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks john operator and our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning i had a followup question on the deposit side you obviously talked about the expected decline from your one thing thats been interesting is that the interest bearing has been declining faster than the noninterest bearing it looks like youre about up to noninterest bearing can you help us understand how you expect that mix to traject do you think you can actually uphold this better mix of free funding versus maybe what had happened in past cycles or is that just a tbd still as well james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks for the question ken this is this was a little bit of a surprise to us too for the mix to actually improve towards the higher noninterest bearing so we have done a little research into that and talk to customers and just analyzed various customers accounts my conclusion is number one were just seeing the price sensitivity at this point of the cycle more on the interest bearing side i do think it will tip to the noninterest bearing side eventually but it feels like customers are first more price sensitive on the interest bearing side of this comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 the other thing that we found kind of confirms the suspicion that weve had all along and thats something thats been very similar to previous cycles where weve come out of some stress we do see the corporate treasurers are carrying higher safety net levels of cash and that explains why theyre maybe going to their interest bearing accounts first to the extent they have use of funds so i think those higher safety nets will probably be around for some time the other anecdotally interesting thing that i dont know how large of a factor it is but it might be a growing factor you know we have heard from some corporate treasurers that realtime payments is making it more unpredictable or more difficult to predict cash flows and so theyre keeping some higher cash levels for that reason also and thats something that might grow over time so those are some of the observations that weve made we do think it will reverse to some extent eventually but id mentioned in the last earnings call that i thought it would get back to the historical ratio if not slightly below where weve been historically im now questioning whether or not we really get back there given the higher levels of safety net cash that these corporate treasurers are taking or holding so i do think itll reverse but theres some question as to whether or not its really ever going to get back to that mix ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah great color thank you and second question just on some of the loan buckets i know youre talking about growth sequentially average in the fourth quarter but theres always a little bit of ups and downs in some of those national businesses can you just run us through some of the most important trends that youre seeing noting the really big cre growth this quarter and then you expect a decline in mortgage just kind of a the ins and outs of that periodend versus average difference as we look ahead thanks peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah ken its peter right i think as we get into the fourth quarter we continue to feel pretty directionally positive about just about all of our businesses i think in the comments we talked about broadbased loan growth and for the first time in a long time all of our businesses are seeing really good loan growth the only kind of real headwind does continue to be mortgage banking finance going into the fourth quarter i think for obvious reasons of challenges in that space with higher interest rates and lower housing inventory but the rest of our sort of larger businesses as you mentioned commercial real estate we expect equity fund services to have a good quarter corporate banking continues to be on a good trajectory albeit we also dont know that the fourth quarter looks like the third quarter but it is positive trending and going into the end of the year so were pretty excited about sort of what were seeing on those larger businesses dealer continues to slightly creep up we get asked a lot about when that will return and i dont know the answer to that but quarteroverquarter youre starting to see a little bit of floor plan usage and we continue to be a very active lender in that space and as i mentioned i financed some of the ma activity that youre seeing in dealer so its nice to see a little bit of usage there as well ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thanks very much comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah operator and our next question comes from the line of jennifer demba with truist securities please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc good morning thanks for taking my question congratulations to darlene and welcome to kelly you mentioned in the monologue youre starting to see signs of normalization of credit could you give us some more color on that and i believe you saw a slight increase in criticized loans from tls area could you give us some color from that as well melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc jennifer thanks for the question its melinda you know overall were really pleased with how the really the entire portfolio has performed and we have guided the last couple of quarters that at some point theres going to be some normalization of the credit metrics from these really really historic low levels and thats what were starting to see but very very modest level of softening of performance in a couple of portfolios and those portfolios as i already mentioned would be leveraged portfolio just given kind of the nature of that book we watch that very very closely it continues to have some modest level of elevated elevated criticized and criticized assets were also watching the automotive portfolio thats not a huge portfolio for us about billion and they have had obviously a lot of challenges coming out of the pandemic the chip shortages and then just kind of layer on all the other inflationary pressures and then technology and life sciences that business by its very nature also has a more elevated level of risk just given the fact that we do early stage and midstage and some late stage companies and some of those late stage companies also tend to be leveraged so we dont see anything in the portfolio that is giving us a lot of pause or a lot of reason for concern and we have the rest of the portfolio which quite frankly continues to perform extremely well so i would say kind of leverage automotive and tls are the areas that were watching and yes we did see a slight increase in the criticized but our npas and our inflow to npas remained very very wellbehaved jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc great thank you and my second question is on fdic premiums jim we know theyre going up next year do you have any preliminary thoughts on what we can expect in james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc we could see an increase on the million million to million ill call it million range so it will be significant not just for comerica but for other banks also so that will be a pressure point for comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks so much james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks jennifer operator and our next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks hey good morning following up on your credit commentary could you give a little bit more color on the increase in the reserve rate and where you would expect that to go if unemployment were to increase to say or just curious for some of the assumptions underlying the current rate and where it could go under those circumstances thanks melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc sure this is melinda again and as you know the cecl process happens every single quarter and its really highly dependent on the economic forecast at that time as well as the performance of the portfolio so what we saw this quarter was a forecast an economic forecast that was slightly deteriorated from where we were at the end of the second quarter although it was still positive unemployment about and gdp moderating below for the next months or so we use that base case scenario as well as a downside case and in our downside case weve already accounted for much higher unemployment in the range of to as well as negative gdp all the way through so we believe that we have accurately and adequately captured the risk of a downside scenario in a recession in the reserves and we do that by the use of the qualitative so we feel really good about our coverage ratio right now again if you look at our fourquarter trailing net chargeoffs you look at what our npas are and then the overall strength of the book overall i think our coverage ratio right now is reflective with an adequate amount of conservatism bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc so following up on that could you give a little bit more color on the weightings that you ascribe to each of those scenarios and perhaps if we did enter into that more greater downside scenario where unemployment goes higher to what extent you would ascribe a higher weighting to that scenario and the impact that would have on the overall reserve rate melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 yeah we dont like weight the scenario specifically we use a baseline scenario and look at the entire portfolio from a quantitative perspective and then we use that downside case on certain portfolios and an overlay to the entire portfolio so if you looked at the mix between our quantitative and qualitative is about and thats been pretty consistent over the last couple of quarters and its very meaningful to the total reserve so again i think we feel really confident that weve captured the downside risk at least over the life of our portfolio which is important to remember thats a relatively short duration portfolio bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful thank you and then separately following up on the tangible capital questions your investment securities portfolio is classified as available for sale which stands in contrast to many of your peers that have a larger mix of held to maturity and very clear that you view the oci marks associated with higher rates is optical but some investors have expressed concern that we could enter a credit cycle that would exacerbate the rate mark headwinds could you speak to that dynamic and whether theres anything that would lead you to consider using the held to maturity designation or perhaps thinking differently about tangible capital james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah bill at this point i dont anticipate us making any movements even if youre inclined to move something to held to maturity you probably wouldnt do it at this point in the cycle so we just continue to be comfortable i know a lot of the larger banks that dont have aoci shielded from capital do have a lot of htm and a lot of our peers did not have much an htm some have moved some in recently or over time after some of the losses had already occurred but we continue to be comfortable there and again i believe its an optic that wont cause any real issue for us bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay thank you for taking my questions james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks bill operator and our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 i want to start so when you look at noninterest bearing deposits which have seen a very material increase over the past two years if you dig down to the account level how much larger are the account balances today and can you size for us the balance that could be at risk jim i heard your commentary about treasurers carrying more of a safety net but lets face it that could easily go into three month tbills right it doesnt need to stay at the bank so can you size that for us james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yes steven good morning certainly when we look at average balance per account that is the main driver thats the largest driver in terms of the higher deposits thats not too surprising to me i think it is consistent with the theme of corporate treasurers carrying higher safety net levels of cash i do think there could be a tipping point where once they move some of the price sensitive interest bearing deposits eventually we will probably see a little bit of migration down of the noninterest bearing deposits so i think that day will come but for now they seem to be more price sensitive on the interest bearing side and i do think theres a limit to how far theyll take down their noninterest bearing i think they are very comfortable with the levels of noninterest bearing they have and ill remind you or maybe educate those out there that a lot of our customers have multiple legal entities sometimes complex structures its not as easy as you might think for them to move cash around to these different structures on hours or days notice so they do like to keep their various entities wellfunded with noninterest bearing dda and i think theres a limit to how far it will come down but i do think itll come down at some point curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jim and steve i might add too this is curt just to remind you around the complexity of our deposit book i mean we have a heavy concentration of commercial deposits and a heavy concentration of wealth management deposits where weve got very close relationships with those customers we know sort of what theyre doing they talk to us through frequent communication around deposit flow treasury management and movement of funds et cetera and so its not like a very granular mass market retail portfolio where you really dont have sort of a lot of sight in conversations occurring with those customers so were going to continue to do the right thing in terms of pricing and taking care of those relationships but we are in frequent communication weve got a good sense of sort of what people are planning to do or not do with deposits james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah and i will add on i mean keep in mind that being a very strong treasury management bank a lot of our ddas are tied into eca so the customer is getting some degree value and incentive to keep their noninterest bearing for that reason too steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc if we stay with that theme of having a good line of sight to what customers are thinking or they might eventually do if we take that and apply it to whatever the fourth quarter nim is i know jim you said theres a lot of variables right we know that but whats your base case or where we go through from the nim based on this line of sight that you guys have into your customer base james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 yeah i never because of our commercial orientation and variability with cash balances that weve seen through the years as well as what were doing with our securities book which effects the mix of the balance sheet weve always been and continue to be very hesitant to provide nim percentage guidance if thats what youre asking so i would just maybe revert back to the guidance that we do expect deposits to level off sometime in early and things to stabilize from that standpoint steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay fair enough and if i could squeeze one more im just trying to put together all of the commentary around expenses i know its early to think about for giving us guidance for next year but should we at least be thinking about a similar growth rate of expenses in versus thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc we will certainly have some expense pressures as i mentioned so its not a bad starting point i mean thats a very rough answer theres a lot of work to be done still but we certainly will have some degree of expense growth next year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks steve operator and our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi thanks good hi good morning last quarter you added an evp from a larger bank to run payments for comerica im wondering if you just talk about the investments needed kind of what the strategy is there and what the revenue opportunities are going forward peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc hey terry this is peter yeah were very excited about our investment in payments i mean we continue to believe that we have a real opportunity to be a leading bank in that space particularly with commercial customers but across our entire enterprise we think theres a lot of opportunities in our treasury management business what we do in card jim talked a little bit about whats going on in realtime payments all of those are opportunities that the comerica has to be a leader and theres a lot of ways you can be competitive you dont have to be the big bank necessarily at this point to be successful and we think weve got a real agile approach comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 and have the ability to partner with lots of different ways to be successful so its a space that were excited about we did hire some talent there both on the payment side and in our tech and ops side were also investing there as well so were very excited about what we see on that on that horizon terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks for that and then as a followup i just want to make sure have you maintain the relationships with all the dealers over the last two years or said in another way when inventory builds do you expect to maintain that market share and kind of go back to where it was pre2000 peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc well terry yeah two questions there have we maintained the relationships absolutely we have you know so were very active in the space talked to customers a lot have added customers i continue to believe that we are going to be on the winning side of the ma activity because we do focus on sort of the mega dealers whether or not inventory levels return to you know to your question when those return i dont know if they were to return to historical levels then we would certainly benefit from it but i think as i said youre going to continue to just sort of see a slight uptick in floor plan usage over the coming years and we believe we will be there to capitalize on that terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc thanks terry operator and with no further questions in queue and ill turn it over for closing remarks to curt farmer president chairman and chief executive officer please go ahead sir curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc let me just say again that we are very proud of our results for the quarter really a record quarter for us i always want to thank our colleagues for all they do every day to take care of our customers and help us grow the company overall for our shareholders so thank you as always for your interest in comerica i hope you have a very good day operator and this concludes todays conference call thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3
