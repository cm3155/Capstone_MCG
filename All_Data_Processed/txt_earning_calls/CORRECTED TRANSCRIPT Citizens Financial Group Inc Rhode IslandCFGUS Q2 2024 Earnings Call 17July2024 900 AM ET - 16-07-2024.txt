deposit ratio was our acl ratio was and federal home loan bank advances are now below million of note we saw our revenues tick up relative to q1 our underlying ppnr grew by over q1 our underlying net income grew by million or we repurchased million in shares over the quarter with our sequential eps up the combination of our strong capital position solid returns and capital freed up from noncore rundown has allowed us the capital flexibility to support our customers and to return capital to shareholders share count is down over versus a year ago our fee growth was relatively broad as capital markets fees continued their rebound led by loan syndications and bond underwriting wealth and card fees both hit record levels we also are seeing nice momentum in our wellposition payments business our private bank had a terrific quarter we reached billion in deposits up from billion in q1 and tracking well towards our yearend goal of billion we brought in two leading private wealth teams in the quarter one from san francisco and one from boston and weve reached billion in assets under management at quarter end with nice momentum our commercial bank hired a middle market leader for florida and for california during the quarter two increasingly important states for us our overall commercial franchise continues to be well positioned in serving the middle market private capital and key growth verticals and we look for our strong performance to continue in the second half i should pause to give a shout out to don mccree for his appointment as senior vice chair in june great recognition for his efforts over the years at citizens citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 we have done a good job in executing on our strategic initiatives top is tracking well to targets and we have commenced work on top which will push into new areas like ai our bso work is progressing well noncore ran down billion in the quarter commercial ci is refocusing on deep relationships and we have a medium term plan to reduce our cre exposure credit metrics are holding up fine outside of general office we continue the lengthy workout of general office which will take several more quarters before we see improvement roughly of our office exposure is suburban versus central business district or loss given default have been about half of cbd properties the good news is that we have our arms around the issue and we dont expect to see major surprises looking forward we continue to be upbeat about our prospects while there are still many uncertainties in the external environment we feel we are in good position to navigate the challenges that may arise and we maintain a positive outlook for citizens over the balance of the year as well as the mediumterm our strategy rests on a transformed consumer bank the best positioned super regional commercial bank and the aspiration to have the premier bankowned private bank we will continue to execute with the financial and operating discipline that youve come to expect from us with that let me turn it over to john john f woods vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone as bruce mentioned second quarter results were very solid in a number of key areas starting with the excellent fee performance driven by strong capital markets fees and record results in wealth and card also we managed our deposit portfolio quite well with stable balances and lower interest bearing costs in a competitive environment which positively impacted nii and nim rounding our quarterly results expenses and credit came in largely as expected with respect to balance sheet strength we continue to maintain a healthy credit reserve position and capital and liquidity levels near the top of our peer group and importantly we are executing well against our various multiyear strategic initiatives including the buildout of our private bank ill summarized further highlights of second quarter financial results referencing slides to we generated underlying net income of million for the second quarter eps of and rotce of maintaining a strong balance sheet position is a top priority and we ended the second quarter with a cet1 at or about adjusted for the aoci optout removal we also maintained our strong funding and liquidity profile in the second quarter our pro forma lcr is which is well in excess of the large bank category requirement of and our period end ldr improved to on the funding front weve reduced our period end fhlb borrowings by about billion linked quarter to million we continued our programmatic approach to increasing our structural funding base with a successful million senior debt issuance during the second quarter and we added about another billion of auto backed borrowings that was our fourth issuance essentially completing our auto program and it was executed at our tightest credit spreads to date we also refinanced preferred stock in the second quarter by issuing million of new preferred and redeeming million of higher coupon floating rate preferred on july credit losses of approximately million were inline with our expectations the nco rate rose a little to basis points reflecting loan balances coming in a little lower than expected our acl coverage ratio of is citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 up basis points from the prior quarter this includes an coverage for general office up from in the prior quarter regarding our strategic initiatives the private bank is doing very well having generated billion of deposits and billion of aum through the second quarter also our investments over the years in the private capital and capital markets space are playing out nicely as demonstrated this quarter finally we are excited about our top of house initiatives including the ongoing benefits from bso and top as well as growing contributions expected from data and technology related initiatives such as generative ai and cloud migration next ill talk through the second quarter results in more detail starting with net interest income on slide as expected nii is down linked quarter reflecting lower net interest margin and loan balances with respect to nim as you can see in the walk at the bottom of our slide our margin was down basis points to reflecting a basis point increase in swap expense due to the basis point decline in average receive rate in the quarter this was partly offset by a net increase in nim of basis points from all other sources including higher asset yields noncore runoff and good deposit cost performance with interest bearing deposit costs down basis points overall our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a very competitive environment with our interest bearing deposit beta at which was down from in q1 moving to slide our fees were up linked quarter given strong results in capital markets and record card and wealth results our capital markets business improved linked quarter with higher bond underwriting and loan syndication fees given strong refinancing activity ma advisory fees were down slightly off a strong first quarter however our deal pipeline remains strong and we expect to see positive momentum in the second half of its great to see our capital markets business holding the number one middle market sponsor bookrunner position for the second quarter in a row this reflects the benefit of the investments weve made in our capabilities since the ipo and demonstrates the diversification of the business card fees were a record primarily given the full quarter benefit of the first quarter transition to a new debit card platform as well as seasonally higher purchase volume we delivered record results in wealth driven by increased sales activity as well as higher asset management fees given the constructive market environment and contribution from the private bank which will continue to grow given the aum increase in the second quarter from our wealth team hires mortgage banking fees are up modestly with a benefit from the msr valuation net of hedging and an improvement in servicing pl production fees were down slightly given a decline in margins on slide underlying expenses were down slightly as we saw the normal seasonal benefit in compensation and we did a nice job managing our expenses while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives our top program is progressing well and we continue to expect to deliver a million pretax run rate benefit by the end of the year weve commenced work on our top program and well provide more details later this year on slide period end and average loans are down linked quarter as we continue to optimize our balance sheet and prioritize relationship based lending the linked quarter decline was driven by the runoff of our non core portfolio of billion core loans were broadly stable with a slight reduction in commercial balances largely offset by an increase in retail the decrease in commercial loans reflects paydowns and exits of lower returning credit only relationships lower client loan demand and corporates continuing to issue in the debt markets next on slides and we continue to do an excellent job on deposits in an extremely competitive environment period end deposits are broadly stable linked quarter as seasonally lower retail deposits was offset by strong growth in the private bank we continue to see a slowing rate of migration from demand on lower cost deposits to higher cost interest bearing accounts with the fed holding steady as well as the benefit of deposit market share gains with the private bank as a result noninterest bearing deposits are stable at about of total deposits our deposit franchise is highly citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 diversified across product mix and channels about of our deposits are granular stable consumer deposits and approximately of our overall deposits are insured or secured this attractive deposit base has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our funding costs in the higher rate environment our interest bearing deposit costs were down three basis points linked quarter given proactive management of our pricing strategy moving to credit on slide net chargeoffs were basis points up basis points linked quarter reflecting broadly stable chargeoffs and lower average loans the commercial chargeoffs in the quarter were largely driven by cre general office and the fact that ci recoveries were higher in one quarter versus q2 this increase in commercial was largely offset by a decrease in retail primarily due to seasonal trends in auto and runoff nonaccrual loans increased linked quarter driven by increases in cre general office and multifamily which has been reflected in the reserve level for the quarter turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide our overall coverage ratio stands at which is a basis point increase from the first quarter reflecting broadly stable reserves and lower loan balances given non core runoff and commercial paydowns and balance sheet optimization our reserve of million for the billion general office portfolio represents an coverage up from in the first quarter additionally since the second quarter of we have absorbed million of cumulative losses in the general office portfolio when you add these cumulative losses to the reserves outstanding this represents roughly a loss rate based on the march balance of billion over the past six quarters the general office portfolio was down roughly million to billion at june given paydowns of about million and the charge offs i just mentioned the loss experienced so far has been concentrated in the central business district properties with approximately times the loss rate of suburban properties suburban exposure is of our total at this point on the bottom left of the page you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level which we believe represents a severe scenario that is much worse than weve seen in historical downturns so we feel the current coverage is very strong moving to slide we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength our cet1 ratio was a strong up basis points from and if you were to adjust for the aoci optout removal under the current regulatory proposal our cet1 ratio would be both our cet1 and tce ratios have consistently been among the top of our peers you can see on slide where our cet1 stands currently relative to peers given our strong capital position we repurchased another million in common shares and including dividends we returned a total of million to shareholders in the second quarter moving to slide our strategy is built on a transformed consumer bank the best positioned commercial bank amongst our regional peers and our aspiration to build the premier bank on private bank and wealth franchise first we have a strong transformed consumer bank with a robust and capable deposit franchise grounded in primary relationships and highquality customer growth notably the transformation of our consumer deposit franchise is the chief reason our deposit performance has dramatically improved from the last upgrade cycle we are much more nimble in our depositraising capabilities now with more levers to pull and better analytical tools and where our beta performance lagged our regional peers last time so far this cycle we are better than peer median we also have a differentiated lending platform where we are prioritizing building durable relationships with our customers and we are focused on scaling our wealth business importantly we continue to make great progress improving digital engagement with our customers and increasing deposit share as we build our customer base particularly in new york metro citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 next we believe we have built the leading commercial bank amongst the superregional banks we are focusing on serving sponsors and middle market companies in the high growth sectors of the economy and we have full set of product and advisory capabilities to deliver to our clients in particular we are uniquely positioned to serve the private capital ecosystem which appears poised for a strong recovery after one of the slowest dealmaking periods in decades we are starting to see a more constructive capital markets environment develop and our consistent position near the top of the middle market and sponsor league tables gives us confidence that we have a right to win as activity picks up finally were building a premier private bank and that is going very well and gaining momentum we are growing our client base and now have about billion of attractive deposits a billion increase from the prior quarter with roughly noninterest bearing also we are now at billion of loans and continuing to grow we recently opened the private banking offices in mill valley california and palm beach florida and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities with our citizens wealth management business as the centerpiece of that effort we added two exceptional asset management teams in the second quarter one from san francisco and the other from boston bringing the total private bank aum to billion well on our way to hit our billion target by the end of importantly our private bank revenue increased to about million in the second quarter and we are on track to breakeven on the bottom line later this year moving to slide we provide the guide for the third quarter this outlook contemplates a basis point rate cut in each of september and december we expect nii to be down to driven by one last stepup in swap costs this cycle noninterest income should be up slightly reflecting seasonally lower capital markets more than offset by a pickup across other categories we expect noninterest expense to be stable net chargeoffs are expected to be down modestly and the acl should continue to benefit from noncore runoff our cet1 ratio is expected to come in about with approximately million to million of share repurchases currently planned with respect to the full year guide we provided in january we feel good about the overall level of ppnr revenues are tracking broadly in line with some puts and takes nii is expected to come in at the upper end of the down to range reflecting lower loan balances with nim trending modestly better fees should come in modestly above the range of to originally expected you should expect us to continue to do well on expenses which will be broadly in line with the january guide we expect nii and net interest margin to rebound in the fourth quarter given swap costs that peaked in the third quarter with a return to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter in addition net chargeoffs are trending in line with our january expectations we continue to expect to end the year with a target cet1 ratio of approximately and the level of share repurchases will be dependent on our view of the external environment and loan growth to wrap up we delivered a strong quarter with good momentum in capital markets record results in wealth and card and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected our capital levels are strong near the top of our peer group and we are maintaining robust liquidity and funding our unique multiyear strategic initiatives including the buildout of our private bank are progressing well and our consumer and commercial banking businesses are wellpositioned to drive strong performance over the mediumterm given these tailwinds combined with strong execution and tight expense management we remain confident in our ability to hit our mediumterm to return target and with that ill hand it back over to bruce citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thank you john allen lets open it up for qa question and answer section operator thank you mr van saun we are now ready for the qa portion of the call operator instructions our first question will come from the line of peter winter with da davidson go ahead peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co can you provide an update on the loan outlook in the second half of the year and maybe just talk about customer sentiment and what its going to take to kind of move them off the sidelines john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and jump on that one so i mean i think were seeing pretty positive signs for as it relates to loan growth you know when we look at the three different businesses that really will drive that weve got the private bank which has demonstrated the ability to not only grow deposits and aum but the private bank is actually penetrating its customer base and growing loans in the second quarter and we expect that to actually continue and begin to accelerate into the second half in the commercial space customer activitys picking up we do expect to see and particularly in our sort of we call them ma advisoryrelated driven finance arena were seeing some opportunities in the subscription line space as well as some pickup in funds finance and then in retail where weve been seeing some opportunities in heloc and mortgage so all three legs of our stool as we call it are starting to demonstrate the ability to really deliver on that loan growth expectation as you look out into the second half donald h mccree a senior vice chair headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john ill jump in on that its don i think one of the interesting things weve seen and this goes to capital markets also is a real pickup in new money activity over the last six to eight weeks as the interest rate cycle appears to be abating and the economy seems to be okay so thats driving growth in subscription lines thats driving a little bit more bullishness among our core ci customers and its certainly driving opportunistic activity among the pe firms so i think well see some decent citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 growth in the second half of the year exact timing im not exactly sure but we did see at the end of the second quarter the beginnings of some pretty significant draws on our subscription lines brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and ill jump in too on the consumer and private banking side the consumer story is a little complicated given the noncore rundown where were running down million to billion each quarter but if you put that aside the fundamentals of our core loan business are actually growing at a reasonable clip really led by residential lending and a little bit in card our heloc position incredibly strong and with rates being higher than we had expected going into the year and our customers having the most home equity in their personal balance sheet in the history of the united states our heloc market position is reaping a lot of benefits for us so were seeing very strong heloc growth despite the mortgage challenges some modest growth in the mortgage portfolio and were starting to see a bit of a tick up on the card book and then turning to the private bank really our offering is much broader than what the team that we hired was used to so were starting to see a diversification of that book early days it was really led by private equity and venture capital call lines thats still a strength of the business model we did see in this last quarter in q2 a diversification towards consumer so consumer is now of the loan book versus in the low 20s earlier in the year so mortgage is starting to pick up some heloc lending and still continued strength in business banking and private equity we expect that trend to continue peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co thats great color thank you and just on a separate question just the stress capital buffer came in higher than i was expecting im sure its higher than what you expected are there any plans to kind of reassess any of the businesses to help drive a lower scb bruce you mentioned some plans over the mediumterm to reduce the cre exposure bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i guess we were a bit disappointed in the scb result and id say i think the fed overall does a pretty good job on credit they are very conservative but they have a lot of data to work from and where weve consistently been frustrated has been on their modeling of ppnr and so our own modeling of ppnr is in a much more robust i think we do things like we pickup forward starting swaps we tailor the situation to the scenario where if rates are much lower than were going to see a pickup in mortgage fees and a pickup in capital markets fees depending on a scenario but anyway id say we had the good news is we have sufficient capital weve run at a conservative level so having a higher scb than we think is appropriate isnt really hindering our strategy and so i dont think peter that we need to make significant changes to the business model i think were on the right track having said that the balance sheet optimization is still places where there is work to do to optimize the risk adjusted returns that we make off the balance sheet and to hopefully improve some of the stress results on the credit side and so cre we could see that run down we topped up after we did the investors acquisition a lot of that was kind of low risk multifamily but certainly we want to create the capacity to lend in areas that really citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 further ph deeper relationships and well have more ci kind of fill some of that void as we bring down cre would probably be the biggest shift that youd see on the balance sheet over time peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it thanks bruce bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay next question allen operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs your line is now open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc this question the first question is for john john i think you were at a conference in june and you talked about very positively about an exit rate for the fourth quarter of and the net interest margin im wondering if you could readdress that again and maybe put it in context of you noted that the swap costs were peaking in the third quarter if you can give that in context on how you expect your asset yields to traject as we think about that september and december rate cut and obviously the basis point improvement in interestbearing deposit costs are notable thoughts on the trajectory from here whether its in context of the rate cuts and without john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure erika i guess what ill start off with is that at the beginning of the year we did indicate that we thought the exit nim would be in that neighborhood of or so id say that as weve gotten into the middle part of the year we expect that to come in a little better so i think i did mention that at conference earlier last quarter and i think we can confirm that those trends continue to be looking good that were going to end up a little better than what we expected and broadly what we said at the time was that we saw loans coming in a little lower and pushed out a little bit more than we had originally expected but that was getting offset in part from better net interest margin trends we were pleased to be able to print a very strong interest bearing deposit costs number that was down basis points this quarter you know i think its very likely that our interest bearing deposit costs have peaked in the first quarter that we have some nice opportunity to kind of price our rollovers of cds in the second quarter and that was a tailwind citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 i think therell be some variability there but i think is probably the peak and thatll provide a nice tailwind as you get into the second half of the year i mean broadly the trends when you get into the fourth quarter are along the following lines every quarter were generating a couple of basis points of positive benefit from all other sources outside of swaps and so given the third quarter is the last time that well see a step up in swap costs really that those that the rest of the bank will be able to drive net interest margin rising off of that nim trough in into and the big drivers would be theres a number of them i mean weve got noncore which continues to runoff and is providing about basis points a quarter of net interest margin all by itself youve got asset yields around basis points or so exswaps given the front book back book dynamic that were seeing which is in that to basis point range of from the standpoint of whats happening with securities and loans and then you have the initiatives with the private bank which is accretive across the board which is contributing so all of those things i think youll see contribute and id say that getting that first fed cut in late september would be also helpful its not necessary for us to stay on track for having a really strong rebound in but it does help id say address the higher for longer pressures that pricing pressures on deposits that will continue to bump along as you know until that first cut comes out from the fed so let me stop there and see if that addresses a number of the points that you made erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc that does and as you layout the past and you said a third from a rising costs for the net interest margin from what you mentioned as a trough im wondering about the size of the balance sheet do you feel like your mix is optimized in other words as your investors think about a normalizing nim and multiply that by your balance sheet is your balance sheet growth going to be in line with business growth or will there be moves that youre making in terms of wholesale funding or whatever else that could move balance sheet growth sort of underneath business growth or above business growth john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah its good question i think there might be two different answers here one is is in the second half of we have a at the balance sheet date here at june we have a significant amount of excess liquidity and so you could see us deploy some of that into lending through the second half and thatll thats very powerful in terms of the ability to drive net interest margin and so were pleased to be able to do that given how strong our balance sheet position is at june but id say when you zoom out and think about the mediumterm we without a doubt have opportunity to grow the balance sheet over time in line with business growth adjusted for the balance sheet optimization initiatives that we have in place but that powerful combination of net interest margin reflating into that call it what do we say to range plus the opportunity to grow the balance sheet over the mediumterm is really one of the it is the primary and majority driver of our rotce targets over the mediumterm so i think maybe a little bit of transition in where well probably deploy some liquidity but then growing into and and beyond citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i would just add to that erika is i do think we have one thing thats pretty unique to us which is the launch of the private bank so if we just grow at kind of nominal gdp kind of in the mediumterm for consumer and commercial we should grow a little faster because the private bank is scaling up and certainly as the customer base grows and we keep adding and investing in the business we should see additional growth there erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc well said guys thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay operator your next question will come from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs your line is now open mr nash if you could please check your mute feature on your phone kristin silberberg a headinvestor relations citizens financial group inc rhode island allen maybe we can come back to ryan lets move on to the next question and well circle back to ryan operator yes one moment please mr nash you will have to requeue operator instructions well go next to scott siefers with piper sandler your line is now open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right thanks for taking the question maybe we could sort of pivot to the fee story for a moment thats been a pretty solid story this quarter and john so it sounded like well see maybe some seasonal capital markets weakness in the third quarter but it feels like its on a good trajectory so just maybe some thoughts on the overall investment banking pipeline how it looks and then just broader thoughts on the main drivers as you see them for the feebased outlook john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island ill start off with broader the broader picture and maybe ill let don tell us a little bit more about the capital markets pipeline outlook but more broadly i mean were really pleased with our performance in the second quarter and printing another number one middle market sponsor position on the league table its nice to see for the second quarter in a row you know is the typical seasonal period where its a little down for capital markets and we expect that may play out as its done in prior years but i mean i think the floor in those in that seasonally down period is actually higher this year than its been in prior years so thats something to keep in mind that given all of the investments we actually sure will be down off a great but the floor is probably higher than prior years number one number two the diversification not only within capital markets but outside of capital markets and all the investments weve been making in wealth citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 we had those two significant asset management teams that we brought on board plus all of our organic investments inside the private bank and broadly is really driving wealth fees so here to see wealth fees be a bigger contributor in the third quarter and ph just how you see the rate environment moving around were seeing opportunities and are helping our customer hedge the exposure to rates and so were going to we expect to see some benefit there and just a number of other categories including service charges and an ability for possibly some mortgage banking opportunities as rates seem to be stabilizing and down so theres just a number of other categories given the diversification of the platform that will allow us to stay on track here as you head into the third quarter bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and also just to add to that we did take some regulatory cleanup items in other income so that was suppressed in the quarter which should bounce back next quarter but with that don why dont you give a little more color on donald h mccree a senior vice chair headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so its interesting you know the characteristics of the market are very favorable right now theres enormous amounts of liquidity and that drove really the first half of the year which was primarily a ph like refinancing market so if you look at transactions done in the core capital markets being syndicated lending and bonds it was about refinancing of existing exposures that were on peoples balance sheet and extending maturities and alike but what we didnt see and what were beginning to see is new money activity led by the private equity team so as we move into a more favorable interest rate environment a decent economic environment were starting to see the pipelines really grow on the pe side of the business and frankly thats where the big underwritings are and thats where the profitability drives ma is hanging in there pretty well remember we are primarily a middle market investment bank so we do the midsized deals million valuation to a billion valuation million capital raise to a billion capital raise so those have actually been more resilient than the really big ticket ma deals which are getting government scrutiny and getting held up in regulatory approval so those seem to be moving along reasonably well the place we havent seen a lot weve seen actually more than we saw last year is in the ipo side of the business there are a lot of ipos that are kind of prepped and ready but people arent pulling the trigger and going to market and some of thats been the aftermarket performance of the ipo that have happened so far but continue to get the broadening of the equity markets and the high rise in the equity markets you could see some of that begin to come and then we have a pretty decent pipeline in the convert side in the follow on side so its broadbased its pretty encouraging and i think the backdrop is very favorable for a good second half and a great frankly and we think weve got all the pieces we need to take advantage of the markets brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island id maybe just very quickly add on the consumer side our improvement is very durable sticky fee revenue so the card changes that both john and bruce mentioned we reissued million debit cards last quarter and a new citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 contract that just drops directly to the bottom line its predictable and will stick around service charges has bottomed out mortgage we think will be in the zone it could be a little bit of favorability of rates if rates drop a little bit and then the wealth aum growth is sticky durable repeatable fee income so thats what were calling for a steady continued upward momentum on consumer without a lot of volatility donald h mccree a senior vice chair headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island and ill just add one more thing is is were beginning to see its interesting because the private banking teams never had a capital market business as their prior employer and so were starting to see some crossover activity among the private banking clients that are coming on board in the capital markets i dont know if thats a second half thing but i think thats a brand new opportunity from a client base that was never really resident at citizens before r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co terrific thank you for that color and then wanted to ask a little bit about the reserve and specifically the office reserve i think were up at now which is of course very very high i guess im curious about the factors as you might think about them that would allow you to start sort of absorbing losses with that existing reserve in other words what sort of allows that office reserve to start to come down rather than to continue to tick up i think when you talk about the reserve more broadly youve pointed to noncore runoff as being the thing that might allow the reserve to benefit but just curious about how office sits in there in particular bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would say ill start and let john add color but id say the office theres still a lot of uncertainty in that space just what were seeing in terms of valuations cap rates the path of future interest rates and so i think weve played it conservatively with having a big reserve and then just kind of letting the chargeoffs run through while maintaining the reserve i think youd have to get to a point where you started to see things solidify a little bit and start to move in the right direction so to speak and i dont really see that happening actually for and certainly this year itll happen maybe sometime in next year so were kind of prepared for a ph slog here on office that weve got our arms around the properties we know what the maturity schedules are weve got good people working with the borrowers to deliver good outcomes i dont expect well see any big surprises but well continue to i think just work our way through it at the point where we hit a kind of feel better moment when things start to look like theyre moving in the right direction thats when well be able to start to draw down on the reserve and well reap a nice benefit when that happens john john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would just echo that point i mean just having some growing confidence in valuations and seeing maybe transactions occur could be in all likelihood a outcome and so that this is a multiquarter probably multiyear journey that were on but given all the balance sheet strength that we have with our capital position we feel really confident that any uncertainties are expressed in the reserves and anything else would be supported by the capital i would also mention that were working the book down i mean we started out at billion were down to billion so were lowering the exposure every quarter were working on citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island some of that as a good way through repayments and some of its through chargeoffs john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah exactly bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island nonetheless it is coming down john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island exactly and and so were getting some kind of payoffs and paydowns were getting were working through the riskier credits and were having conversations that have been accelerated given our maturity profile that weve had the opportunity to really lean in with our borrowers and when and if weve come to sort of extensions weve been able to extract in many cases better positioning and collateral so this is as i said multiquarter journey and were feeling good about where were at bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i would just to elevate too to the second part of your question is that away from that away from the general office were still feeling good about what were seeing in the consumer metrics in commercial ci and we run our reserve calculations based on scenarios and clearly the risk of recession seems to be less than it was a couple quarters ago and so our need to keep adding to reserves for rest of the book would seem to be abating somewhat so thats why when we say well continue to see were calling out a slightly lower chargeoff number in q3 and then we have the trend of being able to draw down on those reserves which i think will accelerate in coming quarters r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you all very much operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies one moment please while we open your line mr usdin your line is now open go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great good morning hey john and bruce on the cost side so you guys are doing a really good job keeping costs flat you mentioned earlier youre hiring some bankers you obviously have the wealth management people im just wondering if you can help us understand like the growth that you have there and like where the top and extra cost program are in terms of the offsets to be able to kind of still hold the line citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 i know that its kind of in line with your full year guidance but just the puts and takes of kind of where we are at this point of the year in terms of if theres just more to come on top to offset those hires and the growth and the strong investment banking results etcetera thanks john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thanks ken for the question you know just talking about top its been emblematic of who we are as you know for a number of years the top line program is going to generate call it million or so run rate benefits when you get to the end of this year in the underpinnings of that program we often have vendor contributions thats a big driver we launched a data and analytics contribution this year which will continue into future years weve had a really interesting ability to invest in our fraud program and a number of other opportunities including branch rationalization that have underpinned a really strong top program this year and that of course is the way over time we have been and been able to invest in entrepreneurial and innovative initiatives while not needing to cover that and to selffund those kinds of things you know the top program were working on and were feeling good about the early opportunities i think weve launched some analysis in the generative ai space and were live on a couple of use cases and i think were going to see an ability to broaden out there pretty pretty nicely in terms of underpinning the next top program theres a half dozen of other areas expanding data and analytics what were doing in our technology space which converging our platforms with our ability to converge our mainframes and so i do think that we feel very good about the ongoing ability to make investments and selffund those investments to the top program in as you get into the end of and into and maybe ill just stop there and see if theres anything else that others would like to add ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great all right second question i know that you issued million preferreds and redeemed million in early july and i think with that youre still kind of in the ph zone maybe preferreds to rwas as you contemplate the buyback as you think about the scb and all of that like how do you just think about the overall capital stack in terms of like what your ultimate goals are for optimization of your capital position thanks john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island were feeling pretty good about where we stand in the capital space i mean i think we basically think that around ph is fine we end up with that we probably have more cet1 so when you look at the overall tier stack weve got higher quality capital given the fact that we have more cet1 driving our overall tier ph is fine just probably we probably wont go much below that and a range of to of rwas is probably where well operate we have a number of issues out there that are coming into call periods into and so there could be some opportunities to refinance just like we did this year there are some very interesting refinance opportunities to citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 lower our preferred coupon that were paying on the preferred capital so thats something well keep an eye on as we go forward into ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great and sorry just wanted to follow up on that last one so the rwas have been coming down and your average earning assets have been kind of flat i know you talked a little bit about this earlier but is kind of flattish on total balance sheet size average earning assets is that the right way to think about things going forward given all the moving parts on both sides of the balance sheet john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean for i think the answer that is yes with growing rwas as ph well as i mentioned we have excess liquidity at june and you could see the overall balance sheet being basically in the same zone as where we are today but the ability to basically deploy some excess liquidity into lending in the second half is really the plan so we would see rwas and loans growing from june to the end of the year bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah rwa john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island we can see some growth though in id say spot deposits and spot loans in q4 above that about just deploying the liquidity so just to be clear bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah agreed john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island were going to see deposit growth and loan its just that given the excess securities that we have on balance sheet the overall interest earning assets are about where theyll be maybe john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay yes bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island just a little bit higher yes citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thank you operator your next question will come from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley your line is now open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning if i try to back into the nii number using your full year guide and the guide it implies a to quarteronquarter increase in nii in my question there is what do you need to see that uptick in nii i mean i know there is some benefit from the on the swaps front but do you also need to see loan growth do you need to see deposit costs continuing to come down do you need any help from ph rates can you help us frame that john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure yeah and id say broadly that the majority of the increase in is really coming from net interest margin rebounding so just allowing all of those positive tailwinds from net interest margin across the whole platform from noncore to front book back book dynamics and all of those drivers is the majority of the increase in nii for however there is a meaningful contribution expected from loan growth as well and we talked about loan growth earlier in the call and how all three businesses private bank consumer and commercial are all expected to contribute to that in terms of how that plays out for the second half when it comes to just that net interest margin number as i mentioned noncore front book back book you also have increase in deposits that you just heard bruce talk about that increased thats a better funding mix where well have more deposits and less wholesale funding as you get into the second half you know your other question about that deposit pricing and the rate cut i think were somewhat well balanced around whether the fed cuts or not we tend to have some offsetting forces there where we have some asset sensitivity and a net floating position that benefits with rates being a little higher but then thats often the higher for longer impact on deposit migration tends to keep us close to neutral and so whether we get a cut or not i think were feeling pretty good about the fourth quarter nii being a nice rebound at a meaningful increase versus and then the last part ill throw out there is its again all the initiatives and how for example balance sheet optimization and private bank are all accretive to net interest margin on a quarterly basis bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and i would just add to that as well that we also think that a reminder that the q4 is a seasonally strong quarter for fees so i think there could be that rebounded nii kicking in in q4 strong fee quarter continued discipline on expenses credit seemingly moving in the right direction so and then continued share repurchase so you put that all together you could have kind of a nice uptick in the q4 results citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc thats really helpful and then as a follow up on the commercial middle market side you outlined several positive drivers for lines picking up in the back half does that come with higher utilization or do you need to see lower rates for utilization to pickup and maybe how does the uncertainty around the election how is that factoring into your conversations with clients donald h mccree a senior vice chair headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah what were seeing what were assuming in our utilization growth is its largely in the capital call and subscription lines so were seeing a little bit in the middle market so i think the middle market trend will be a little longer what weve seen our middle market companies do is kind of take their leverage levels down with economic uncertainty so as the economy begins to show signs of stabilization or more certainty stabilization maybe they get a little more aggressive investing in their businesses and i was with a whole bunch of middle market ceos last week and every single one of them said they have renewed investment plans over the next months so thatll take a little bit longer and i dont really see a massive impact of from the election i think you may get some market volatility based on what someone says day in day out but i think the mediumterm trend is intact and we are seeing i mean the playbook were going to run in california and florida which bruce mentioned is going to mirror the playbook we ran in new york where were having just extremely strong client acquisition as we bring experienced market bankers onto the platform and they bring their clients with them so very early days but those pipelines are building kind of literally within two months of hiring a new banker so they wont be huge numbers at the outset but theyll be another tailwind for us i think manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore your line is now open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi john pancari q analyst evercore isi citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 bruce i think you talked about the expectation the mediumterm plan to shrink the cre exposure incrementally from here just want to get an idea of where you think that could settle out i mean right now your commercial real estate loans are about of your riskbased capital plus reserves where do you think it goes from that perspective post this expected runoff bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah id say over the medium term wed probably take the pure commercial book down at least and thatll come across the asset classes obviously we want to be smaller in office multifamily we can lead that down a bit since we took a big upsurge with the investors deal we will make room for some cre opportunities with the private bankers since thats a an important part of their customer base and so theyll be a little bit of offset to that but that kind of directionally gives you a sense as to kind of what the plans are and as i said earlier in the call i think were making room for more ci growth that wed like to kind of flex and have a bigger loan capital allocation to ci and a smaller to cre over time john pancari q analyst evercore isi right okay no thank you thats helpful and related to that my second one is on the private banking side you know first on the deposit side the billion in deposits i know of that is commercial of that is dda how much of those deposits are deposits with venture capital and private equity firms or related to that industry brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah of the commercial and business banking oriented deposits the majority are from private equity and venture firms but i would note that its heavily led by operating deposits and so the way that the relationship actually works is starting as their cash management operating bank which is why the dda and cwi percentage is so high in the business so theyre stable predictable and generally lendable deposits so were pleased with the profile if you think of the loans that have come in obviously the ldr of the private bank is quite low and weve got a good amount of liquidity padding when you look at the lendability and the deposit base to continue to drive loan growth even within the profile just the private bank so were pleased with the quality that youre seeing the loan book diversify to consumers the deposit book has still remained in that sort of split but given the pace of growth that obviously suggests that the consumer business is also growing at a pretty healthy clip that just takes some time and we do expect that to catch up and it will diversify over time to more of a maybe over the longer term horizon but bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island with both deposits and loans brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island both deposits and loans and the higher rates have held back on mortgage obviously and then the business banking commercial deposit growth is quicker and lumpier but we do expect that to continue to change over time citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 and were pleased with the strength of the consumer opening these private banking offices which should attract more of a highnetworth individual as well john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you and then one last one would be if you could just maybe update us on the likelihood of additional team hires on the private banking side and then the wealth aum going up to about billion there i know you acknowledged that might be a tougher ph log and but it looks like towards the end of the quarter you had a big jump in aum just curious if you could give a little bit of color around whats driving that recent upturn bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill start and then pass it to brendan but i just want to make an overriding point is that we want to demonstrate that we can run this as a profitable business and so when we initiated the launch of the private bank we put some markers out there as to what we were going to do this year hitting breakeven in the fourth quarter and then next year getting to numbers that had billion of loans billion of aum billion of deposits that translates to accretion to our bottom line and so were still building the business were building the service levels were making investments in more support people and we feel really good about the trajectory that were on we want to get that right we want to get that flywheel running and hit those numbers before we start going crazy making investments in other regions and other opportunities having said that if there are particularly unique situations that we can kind of fit in and execute over the next months that are important locations and they dont affect our ability to hit the numbers well be open to that and then the other thing is on the wealth management side we had a strong base with clarfeld we knew ultimately that we were going to have to expand the capabilities that we had by bringing in more teams and the focus has been at geographically situated teams that can be contiguous with the private banking teams that weve set up in san francisco boston new york and florida and so so far weve been able to bring two great teams like quality everything one in san francisco one in boston thats accounting for a big chunk of that rise in aum with more to transfer in from their customer base so we have momentum there we also have a ton of folks interested in joining our platform so we can have those conversations and keep bringing those wealth teams in because they dont really impact the nearterm financials negatively they usually come in around breakeven with an opportunity to quickly turn into profitability so brendan you can add to that brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah you nailed it so ill repeat what you said i would just say on the wealth side well be very selective on the banking expansion until not only we have confidence in hitting the financials but also its still built and were very pleased with how the book to build is going and were attracting clients the market is still quite disrupted both on the client side as well as the talent side but were going to be very thoughtful and make sure that were only attracting the highest of quality teams and were being very selective on that on the wealth side i would just say look for really the first time in our history i think our right to win in private wealth is at an alltime high and theres a lot of inbounds were getting from some of the highest quality advisors in the market were also being very selective there id remind you all that we have long been on the hunt for citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 scale here and weve looked at a lot of acquisitions weve obviously done one or two over the years but the economics have been a little out of reach with 10plusyear paybacks on tangible book value when youre buying rias given the multiples that some of the private equity firms are paying so the economics of the talent acquisition are significantly more attractive to us obviously with the de minimis tangible book value hit and to bruces point theres not really a large jcurve in the short term so were very pleased with the inbounds and talent that were getting we expect to continue to selectively add top end market wealth talent to really round out the bankers that we hired so were looking forward to a strong second half of the year there john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks brendan operator your next question will come from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning bruce good morning john john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc john you talked and you gave us good detail about the office portfolio commercial real estate i think you said that some of your assumptions in the bottom lefthand corner of slide show that this downturn is far worse than historical downturns can you share with us two ideas or two answers first is when you look back i think you guys have been aggressively attacking this portfolio for just over a year now when you look back at those early workouts in the second quarter of how are the assumptions that youre using then compare to today and then second and im with bruce that maybe this office problem doesnt resolve itself until sometime next year what are you seeing incrementally in terms of valuations or losses is it still deteriorating in office or has it just stabilized and we just got to work through these portfolios john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and start off gerard i mean i think that earlier that whats evolved over the last year or so has been our outlook with respect to valuations and noi and what the rent rollovers would actually entail and at what speed we would see deterioration so of course our reserve levels are higher now than they were a year citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 ago you know every quarter we endeavor to put a ring fence around our exposures and give it our best attempt at forecasting what we think the evolution will be and valuations and noi id say that yeah this quarter weve done that again and we feel like weve leaned in with this which really when you look at the property valuations peak to trough that has grown over the last year and that those have been the main drivers for why after charging off we still end up with this reserve of but id say that was there still a lot of uncertainty left but i think that variability were hopeful that the variability in this will start to decline as we continue to work through our maturities and have conversations with our borrowers and extract additional collateral and work through paydowns where we can this will be a multiquarter event and itll take into indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i would just add that i do think the fed is starting to move rates lower that will certainly be a help here so part of the reason the losses ended up higher than what potentially we thought back in early just those cap rates going up we had inflation that was impacting noi and things like that and so i think weve seen inflation now leveling off and if the fed starts to move rates down that could also start to move things in the other direction its too early to call a victory here but there are some positive signs and i think lease up rates generally are actually holding or potentially getting a little better as return to office picks up but that again thats not that significant in the big scheme of things gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay is it fair to say that the second derivative of the rate of deterioration that you guys are seeing is it slowing in the bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc office or bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 yes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes okay good bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island definitely gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you okay then as a follow up you guys talked a lot about private equity and youve in your slide you show some great numbers obviously youre number one in the sponsor business and your capital markets business is benefiting from that so the question i have is and its not on the capital call or subscription lines but it seems over the years for banks to win in this capital markets business with sponsors you have to use your balance sheet to win this business youve got to lend money to the sponsors so can you share with us your exposure to i guess one of the line items and one of the regulatory reports is nondepository financial lenders that you lending to them can you share with us your exposure there how you manage that risk because it seems like the banking industry has been derisked but maybe its in the private credit side and the indirect exposure for the industry could come through that channel can you give us some color there bruce or don thank you donald h mccree a senior vice chair headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah hey gerard why dont i take that its don so we bank the private capital sector in several different ways we obviously have capital call and subscription lines which are based on the lps we have financing lines to some of the private credit organizations which are kind of structured as almost like assetbacked lending where we have diversified pools of loans underneath it and we have advance rates and the like so its actually relatively safe almost investment grade like lending even if those complexes begin to take some losses on their underwriting portfolios so we like those two businesses a lot were probably not going to grow them too much more across the entirety of the company because it is a large concentration already but when you look at that those nonbank financial numbers that includes insurance companies theres a whole bunch of other exposures in there also and then of course we land the riskiest stuff we do is to the underlying leveraged buyouts and our strategy there forever has been very large holds its an underwrite to distribute business if the average outstanding is like million on a given deal so very diversified across a large group of leverage credit the book is actually shrinking given the lack of market activity over the last kind of year and a half or so so we feel like were very well diversified and ive been doing this business as you know for a very long time and where you get really hurt as when you have big concentrations in leveraged loans and we see that with some of our competition but were not going to go there just because thats the way we run those businesses so those are the really big ph parts citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank one moment while we open your line mr oconnor your line is now open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you good morning can you guys talk about how you think deposits will price down i guess the first kind of call it two or three fed cuts versus a more sustained reduction john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure ill take that i mean think what we what were likely to see under the first couple of cuts were modeling out approximately to down betas in those first couple of cuts the way the forwards have it playing out over the longer longer those cuts are in place the more theres the opportunity to see rollovers of cds etcetera and to lean in and price down so the fact that we have i think the forwards get down to around by the end of and may start to get into the range in terms of our outlook when you get out into and beyond through that full tightening cycle we think that the full round trip could be could approach the down betas could approach where our up betas were our up beta is around i think the down beta could get up to that level over the full cycle but itll be to for the first couple matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then thoughts on does deposit growth pick up a bit for i guess the industry and youve got some specific initiatives obviously but do you see pickup in kind of broader deposit trends as well with some price cuts john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i yeah i mean i think broadly we believe were going have deposit growth in the second half contributing from all three of our businesses and so is a seasonally down quarter we saw that and we were expecting that plus all of our initiatives that we have in place are going to contribute to deposit growth in the second half weve got that one cut in september and our outlook thatll be helpful i dont think that is absolutely necessary to have that cut in order to continue to have deposit growth but certainly it would be helpful to get that deposit growth to stop kind of the migration aspects and the mix shifts that the industry has been seeing and then as you broaden that out and when we have overall deposit growth and average deposits are higher thatll be consistent with a very positive funding mix because wholesale funding can be lower in terms of funding the balance sheet and thats a tailwind for nii and nim into the second half as well bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 yeah i would just add color there is that the uptick in private bank deposits in the quarter was billion and so you can see that were really got a cadence and a rhythm in terms of kind of growing the book there in the private bank and bringing in the customer base so we would expect to have again something that most other banks dont have to drive deposit growth in having that unique business opportunity and then theres generally some seasonality thats favorable in the consumer in the commercial business so i think the outlook for deposits growth in the second half is pretty pretty solid brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island the one point i would add on the consumer side is that weve a number of years in a row where weve outperformed on a relative basis on dda and low cost deposits and with benchmarking that we see so far this year we believe were number one in the peer set and consumer for relative dda performance and we see that continuing so we think the trends have stabilized so much of our deposit strategy is grounded in the health of our dda base and we expect whatever the market throws us that well continue to outperform peers and weve been doing that for a long time now and certainly this year has been a real strength bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay i think thats it for the queue thank you everybody for dialing in today we certainly appreciate your
