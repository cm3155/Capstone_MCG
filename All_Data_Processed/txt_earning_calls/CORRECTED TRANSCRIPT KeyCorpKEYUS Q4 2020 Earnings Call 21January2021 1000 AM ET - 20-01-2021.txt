economic downturn their dedication combined with our investments in talent and digital capabilities continue to serve the company our clients our communities and our shareholders well keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 throughout and we successfully executed what i call our dual mandate by that i mean responding to the pandemic which is a real humanitarian and economic crisis while continuing to position key for both growth and success we have taken countless steps to ensure that our teammates and our clients are both safe and well served additionally we provided billions of dollars in credit to our clients in we originated more than loans amounting to billion through the first round of the paycheck protection program in fact we are currently assisting our clients through the second round of the paycheck protection program as we speak as part of our national community benefits plan we provided billions of dollars in support to our communities this included affordable housing home lending and small business lending in low and moderateincome communities transformative philanthropy and renewable energy financing our commitment also includes programs to advance social justice and economic inclusion across all the communities we serve and finally i want to thank our teammates for rising to every challenge in in a way that kept our clients at the center of everything we do i am now turning to slide getting back to our performance in the fourth quarter we achieved a record level of revenue for both the quarter and the year the growth in net interest income and fee income net interest income was up almost from the prior quarter with an 8basis point increase in our net interest margin fee income also a record up doubledigits for both the prior quarter and the year ago period we continue to benefit from investments that we have made across our company which drove both fee income and balance sheet growth let me touch on three specific areas first consumer mortgage we achieved record volume in the fourth quarter with billion in funded loans for the full year our consumer mortgage originations were billion up from the prior year this drove both balance sheet growth as well as a increase in fee income approximately onehalf of our originations last year were purchase mortgages our pipelines remain strong and we expect to continue to both grow and take share the second area i will highlight is investment banking this is an area where we have invested in talent and made targeted acquisitions to enhance our capabilities including areas such as healthcare and technology in the fourth quarter we generated million in fees which represents a record quarter we enjoy broadbased growth across the platform with particular strength in ma and loan syndications was a record year for investment banking and debt placement fees our investment banking pipelines remain strong we believe this business will continue to be a growth engine for us in the future the third area is laurel road and more broadly the investments we have made in digital across our company laurel road continues to originate highquality loans that provide us with an opportunity to build broader digital relationships with healthcare professionals last year laurel road originated over billion in loans at the end of march we will launch our digital bank serving the healthcare segment expanding our consumer franchise nationally this launch will broaden our offering for laurel road clients to include deposits additional lending products and other valueadded services we believe that both laurel road and consumer mortgage will continue to be relationshipbased growth engines for our consumer business keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 our expenses this quarter were elevated they were elevated due to higher productionrelated incentives severance and the funding of our philanthropic foundation additionally covid related expenses and costs associated with our prepaid card also remained elevated again this quarter don will cover the outlook in his remarks but we expect expenses to come down in while concurrently investing in talent and digital capabilities this year we will also be accelerating the pace of branch closures we expect to consolidate over branches representing of our network most of these closures taking place in the first half of the year our decisions are driven by client behavior as more activity continues to move toward digital channels its also informed by our robust analytics we expect limited client attrition as a high percentage of the impacted branches are located within two miles of another key facility importantly we expect to continue to grow our retail business while reducing operating expenses and improving overall profitability credit quality remained strong this quarter with net chargeoffs of basis points within our targeted over the cycle range additionally nonperforming loans declined by almost million this quarter we will continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile and concurrently positioning the company to perform well through the business cycle finally we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders in the fourth quarter our common equity tier ratio increased basis points to which is above our targeted range of to the results of our recent stress tests affirm that key is a different company today with loss rates and lossabsorbing capital among the best in our peer group our strategic positioning allows us to continue to execute against each of our capital priorities supporting organic growth paying dividends and of course share repurchases last week our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to million over the next quarters we also approved our first quarter common stock dividend of a share in closing despite the challenging environment of the last year we were able to support our clients invest in and grow our businesses while maintaining our strong risk practices our success was driven by our dedicated team the strength of our business model and our relentless focus on executing our strategy i am confident in keys future we are positioned to succeed and continue to deliver on all of our commitments i will now turn it over to don who will provide details on our quarter in addition to our outlook for the coming year don donald r kimble chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thanks chris im now on slide as chris said it was a very strong quarter for us with record net income from continuing operations of per common share up from the prior quarter and from the prior year ago period return on average tangible common equity for the quarter was over up over basis points from the third quarter i will cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation turning to slide total average loans were billion up from the fourth quarter of last year driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans commercial loans reflect an increase of over billion from the ppp loans consumer loans benefited from the continued growth from laurel road and as chris mentioned keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 strong performance from our consumer mortgage business laurel road originated million of loans this quarter and billion for the full year up over from the full year of we also generated another record billion of consumer mortgage loans in the quarter bringing the total for the year to billion the investments weve made in these areas continue to drive results and importantly add highquality loans to our portfolio linked quarter average loan balances were down reflecting paydowns from the heightened commercial loan draws as well as a small reduction in ppp balances related to initial forgiveness line utilization rates are at the prepandemic levels given the strong liquidity levels in the environment importantly we have remained disciplined with our credit underwriting and have walked away from business that does not meet our moderate risk profile we remain committed to performing well through the business cycle and we manage our credit quality with this longerterm perspective continuing on to slide average deposits totaled billion for the fourth quarter of up billion or compared to the year ago period and up from the prior quarter the linked quarter increase reflected a broadbased commercial growth as well as growth from higher consumer balances the growth was offset by a continued and expected decline in time deposits growth from the prior year was driven by both consumer and commercial clients total interestbearing deposit costs came down basis points from the third quarter of exceeding our guidance of a to basis point decline continue to have a strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over of the total deposit mix turning to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was billion for the fourth quarter of compared to million a year ago and just over billion from the prior quarter our net interest margin was for the fourth quarter of compared to for the same period last year and from the prior quarter both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet compared to the year ago period the larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced the net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows compared to the prior quarter net interest income increased million and the margin improved by basis points the increase in both net interest income and the net interest margin quarteroverquarter are largely due to the lower interestbearing deposit cost and the higher loan fees from ppp forgiveness we saw the average rate paid on interestbearing deposits declined basis points from the prior quarter the forgiveness of the ppp loans accelerated about million of additional fee recognition this quarter these were partially offset by continued elevated liquidity levels which had a 5basis point negative impact on the margin moving to slide our feebased businesses hit alltime highs in the fourth quarter noninterest income was million for the fourth quarter of compared to million for the year ago period and million for the third quarter compared to the year ago period noninterest income increased million the primary driver was a record quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees which reached million up million from the year ago period stronger ma and loan syndication fees drove most of the increase this quarter this business also had a record year with million of total fees keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 record mortgage originations drove consumer mortgage fees this quarter which were up million from the fourth quarter of cards and payments income also increased million related to higher prepaid card activity from the state government support programs compared to the third quarter noninterest income increased by million the largest driver of the quarterly increase was once again the record quarter for investment banking which was up million commercial mortgage servicing fees also had a strong quarter up million im now turning to slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion compared to million last year and billion in the prior quarter the increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel costs driven by higher production related incentives from our record fee production as well as higher severance costs yearoveryear payments related costs reported in other expense were million higher driven by higher prepaid activity and we incurred covid19 related expenses to ensure the health and safety of our teammates compared to the prior quarter noninterest expense increased million the increase was largely due to million of higher production related incentives million of severance million of higher stockbased compensation related to the share price and a million additional contribution to our charitable foundation marketing expense was also up million from the prior quarter turning to slide overall credit quality remains strong for the fourth quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans slightly below our guidance range our provision for credit losses was million this was determined under the cecl methodology and based on our continued strong credit metrics and leading indicators as well as our outlook for the overall economy credit migration and loan production nonperforming loans were million this quarter or basis points of periodend loans compared to million or basis points from the prior quarter additionally 30day to 89day delinquencies actually improved quarteroverquarter with a 9basis point decrease while the 90day plus category remained relatively flat weve continued to monitor the level of assistance requests we receive from our customers over the past quarter the number of requests for loan forbearance has decreased dramatically as of december loans subject to forbearance terms were less than million down from a peak of billion equating to about of our outstanding balances one more observation this quarter and as chris mentioned earlier in late december the results of the most recent stress test results were published keys results reinforce the commitments we have been making over the past several years that we are a different company with a better risk profile than key showed through the great recession our stressed credit losses for from the test were peer leading weve been managing the company over the last decade to outperform during challenging times and believe we have positioned the company to achieve this turning to slide we updated our disclosure that highlights certain portfolios that are receiving greater focus in this environment these areas represent a small percentage of the total loan balances each relationship in these focus areas continues to be subject to active reviews and enhance monitoring importantly as a group they continue to perform consistent with our expectations now on to slide keys capital position remains an area of strength we ended the fourth quarter with a common equity tier ratio of up basis points from in the third quarter this places us above our keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 targeted range of to this provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders importantly the results of the recent stress test support and highlight our strong credit profile and lossabsorbing capital last week our board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to million for the next three quarters they also approved our first quarter common dividend of per share on slide we provide our full year outlook this builds on our performance in and reflects our expectation that we will deliver positive operating leverage for the year guidance range definitions are provided at the bottom of the slide average loans are expected to be relatively stable although at this point i would expect a little downward bias to this range this reflects participation in the next round of ppp and continued growth in our consumer loan portfolio from both laurel road and our consumer mortgage business we expect deposits to be up low singledigits and we will continue to benefit from our lowcost deposit base net interest income should be relatively stable our net interest income will benefit from our higher loan fees related to ppp forgiveness and continued deployment of some of the excess liquidity offset by the ongoing impact of low rates noninterest income should be up low single digits reflecting growth in most of our core feebased businesses as chris mentioned noninterest expense should be down in somewhere in the low singledigit range we will continue to benefit from our continuous improvement efforts and accelerated branch closures we also plan to continue to invest in talent and to stay at the forefront of our digital offerings moving on to credit quality net chargeoffs to average loans should be in the basis points to basis point range which is consistent with our throughthecycle range of basis points to basis points and our guidance for our gaap tax rate should be around for the year our guidance also assumes some variability over the course of the year first quarter will reflect normal seasonality including a lower day count and an increase in personnel expense driven by heightened employee benefits finally shown at the bottom of the slide are our longterm targets as chris said we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for we also maintain our moderate risk profile and over time continue to improve our efficiency and overall returns ill close with where chris started recognizing the effort of our team to support our clients and to deliver strong results for both the quarter and the year despite the challenging environment we are well positioned as we head into and plan to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders with that id like to turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the qa portion of the call john keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thank you for taking the question christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co just curious i guess i can infer it from the up low singledigit guide on fees but i was hoping you could provide a little more thoughts on your outlook for investment banking it ended up being just a terrific end to the year but maybe your thoughts on how you see the year playing out just in terms of the nuance i feel like last year it was kind of less traditional ma sort of other drivers within investment banking or that line item that drove it whereas this year maybe its more the traditional stuff that we would think of how do you see it planning out and do you think you can sustain this level or grow upon this level of annual revenues in total there christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure scott well thanks for the question just to step back for a second our integrated corporate and investment bank is a unique and growing franchise its unique among all of our peers its really hard both to coordinate and collaborate and get it done from a cultural perspective and as you know scott weve been at it for a long time and weve made a bunch of significant investments if you think about the investments weve made in technology and in healthcare within any year theres always variability but as we step back and look at that business over the past five years its had a compound annual growth rate of about and so and if you look at from to present i think weve had one year where we were down slightly i think last year down like so im just giving you that as kind of a backdrop as we look forward theres no question that its the transaction business and theres a lot of variables that clearly are not within our control having said that for us its a relationship business we continue to grow it our pipelines today are strong our pipelines are in good shape and whats interesting about our business is whereas a lot of people had a huge lift from investmentgrade debt through the pandemic that really is not core to our business keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 our business was really driven scott by a big surge in ma and syndications in some cases related syndications so we feel good about the trajectory of the business and well continue to invest in it r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co terrific thank you and then i guess more of a tiggytag guidance question in expenses i know you had the million in severance cost in the fourth quarter will there be any further charges or did you sort of take care of all of those in the fourth quarter and if there are any are those included in the full year guide donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp we would typically have some severance throughout the year we would not expect to have any of that size going forward into the each of the quarters in so the normal recurring level would be reflected in that guidance but not assuming any significant charges on top of that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you very much guys donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator our next question is from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning i wanted to ask about loan yields although there were some quarters of relative stability in keys loan yields during the last ph zerve cycle the overall trajectory of loan yields was lower until we exited ph zerve i believe you guys have about of your loan book is indexed to the short end of the interest rate complex and so a lot of its repriced already but theres still some and that dynamic happened not just for you guys but for other banks as well so can you discuss whether you expect downward pressure on loan yields to persist in this ph zerve cycle as well and are you simply going to work through it to offset those headwinds in general is there anything i guess different about this cycle that leads you to expect those dynamics to play out any differently at this time donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp sure a couple of things there one on the loan book that keep in mind that a significant portion of the swaps that we enter into from a balance sheet perspective are matched up against the commercial loan book and so it does convert some of those over to fixed rates and weve talked over the last couple of quarters about the impact of those swaps going forward and so you will see some very modest pressure on yields coming from that as those swaps roll over keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 on the consumer book we are seeing rates coming down as far as the new originations compared to what was the existing book but were also seeing improved credit quality for those new originations and were also seeing margins a little wider on the consumer originations compared to the current rate environment than where weve been historically and so that will also help and so there will be some pressure going forward but i would say that we still have other levers to help offset that including the full year benefit of the repricing of our deposit book that we realized in the fourth quarter and then also just this excess liquidity position we think over time we can start to absorb some of that and maybe reinvest that over time as well bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah got it thanks don thats super helpful maybe along the similar lines can you talk about ppp how much ppp contributed to loan yields this quarter and how we should expect that contribution to loan yields and nii to trend from here maybe any color on how long the benefits of ppp and are going to last just largely through the rest of or do they extend to and thats my last question thank you donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thats great and weve mentioned just briefly that in the fourth quarter we had about billion of the ppp loans becomes forgiven and so that accelerated about million of fee income for the quarter and so that roughly added about basis points or so as far as the overall margin and so that clearly was additive if you look at that first wave of ppp loans we had about billion of issuance that as i mentioned we had about billion of forgiveness this quarter and so that puts about billion we would expect about of that initial billion be forgiven and so youll see that come throughout the rest of the year i would say that for example we would expect about billion of forgiveness in the first quarter and so thats a little less than what we would have seen in the fourth quarter but still continue to show that kind of a pace the next wave of ppp will be helpful for that and we would expect to see about billion of originations in the second quarter and so some of that decline that we would be expecting from that forgiveness will be directly offset by the new originations and well probably start the end of the first quarter with balances of over billion and so i think that is helpful as far as just the perspective there as far as the fee income component to it that if you look at both the normal accretion of the fee income plus the acceleration coming from the forgiveness that was about million of fee income for we would expect for the first wave of those billion of loans that number would be up to around million or so as far as the fee income from both normal accretion and also the impact of forgiveness and so we have a little bit of a lift on a yearoveryear basis from that and then on top of that we would have the benefit from the new wave two of the ppp program coming through with loan yields and fee income realization from those credits as well bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc so the vast majority by the end of should be realized or does it kick spill over into keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp i would say that the vast majority of the first wave will clearly be addressed in well probably see some of this next wave continue to hang over into as well and so i would say that that incremental lift that were getting from that will be realized in both and bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you so much guys appreciate it donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator next question is from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning hey don just to followup on that last point so all of that what you just ran through on ppp is inside your nii guidance for this year donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thats correct yes ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then secondly just on the loans i heard your point earlier about some of the moving parts and can you just reconfirm for us just how much do you think laurel road can do this year and how much more the mortgage business can grow as an offset to the planned runoff in the auto portfolio on the consumer side donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp sure can that as far as consumer loans that relatively stable outlook for total loans would assume consumer loans in aggregate grow about billion and from to and that growth really coming from both residential mortgage and from laurel road just to put that in perspective we had almost million of originations from laurel road in the fourth quarter just continuing at that pace would be in the billion type of range as far as originations from that category on the residential mortgage side that despite what were seeing and hearing in the industry that we think that we can actually show stable to maybe even increasing our overall residential mortgage originations in keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 but keep in mind that we are at the early stages as far as rolling out that platform throughout our branch network seeing strong growth there and of that billion in the fourth quarter and of the billion for the full year about half of that was for purchase money as opposed to refinance and so we think there still will be opportunities to continue to show growth there and thats adding over billion a quarter as far as the new loan originations in the residential mortgage side and so that consumer growth in those two areas specifically are at the foundation of how we can get to that kind of relatively stable outlook for total loans ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and then just a followup on expenses given the plan for expenses to be overall flat im just wondering you have some variability in the investment banking stuff but just in terms of the cadence of it given the plan to reduce branches and the severancerelated benefits that you get over time is there any way to understand like the cadence of how expenses traject through the year whether or not youre ending lower than youre starting that type of thing thanks donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp great question and i think youve hit on some of the challenge there which is that a number of our drivers of our revenue growth really have a variable cost component to it as far as the origination and so thats a little bit of a challenge i would say that as we look going into the first quarter we would tend to have some seasonality in those numbers and we highlighted a little bit as far as the benefit expense being up in the first quarter we would expect expenses down considerably from where they were in the fourth quarter but probably up from what we would have seen last year last year our revenue outlook was negatively impacted by some market valuation adjustments that also had a corresponding adjustment to our incentive compensation and so we think that well be in a position to generate positive operating leverage for the first quarter and have positive operating leverage for the full year and i just want to restate that as far as our expense outlook we are saying its down low single digits so down to as opposed to stable and so thats after funding the investments were making as part of our strategic initiatives as well ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks don donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator next well go to saul martinez with ubs please go ahead saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 hey good morning so i just wanted to back up a little just make sure i understand the mechanics on the ppp dynamics through net interest income so on the theres an incremental i guess million so pretty modest on the first waves of ppp and then on top of that you overlay the second round which i think you said was billion so if we were to adding that second round and obviously recognizing that these are five years and the fee rates might be lower i mean how much of an incremental lift is that from the second round are we talking it seems like a modest number but would be talking in the neighborhood of something like million a quarter if you could just kind of help us square away sort of the full year and connect the dots fully on the full year versus the full year tailwind that you get more broadly from ppp donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp sure can as far as the impact of that second wave we talked about billion in the first quarter i would say that the full year average probably will be somewhere around billion related to that next wave of the ppp loans if you look at both the stated coupon on those loans and the realization of the fee income it tends to be something a little north of type of yield so you pick up over basis points on those balances through the year so youre probably looking at something for the full year somewhere around million kind of a lift from that compared to just having it sit in cash saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc so we should think about the tailwind then just versus from ppp more broadly being sort of that million plus the incremental million of million versus million so something in the neighborhood of million is that a fair way of looking at it donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp well what i would say is that for the fee income we had million in saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp for the first wave thats about million for that first wave of loans and then this new origination volume of the roughly billion for average would be on top of that and so well actually see a lift yearoveryear of say million would be a ballpark saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yes and that is thats embedded in your guidance obviously donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 that is embedded in our guidance thats correct yes saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc how much of a headwind is the rolloff of the hedges in do you have that figure how much of that goes the other way and because i presume that those hedge rolloffs and the incremental headwind is also embedded in your guidance donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp the headwind is embedded in the guidance i dont have the dollar amount for as far as the direct impact there but it is reflected in that outlook saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc do you know offhand how much hedge benefit you got this quarter from the swaps donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp from the swaps when you say benefit im reluctant to know what that is because it is part of our true hedging strategy and so as far as the cash flow swaps the net interest income add to us for those cash flows swaps is about million which is down about million excuse me about million from the previous quarter saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay okay so million okay perfect thanks so much operator and next well go to gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning chris good morning don christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 don can you share with us when you look at the allowance for loan losses currently based on your slides excluding the ppp loans it looks like youre at about basis points and at the start of the year when all of you and your peers had to convert over to the cecl reserving i think your reserves are about basis points as we look further out maybe end of what do you think the reserve levels could get to do you think they could get back down to where they were in january of this year before the pandemic donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp i think we could see trends in that direction i dont know the absolute timing of that i dont know how to predict where the economic outlook will shift over time but i would say as we go into that the three pieces that impact our provision expense under cecl are one the economic outlook and so assuming thats stable with what we would have predicted wont see any impact there credit migration has been a positive for us and each quarter as we take a look at what our projected credit losses are that trend continues to get better and so thats allowing for reductions to the provision compared to normal and then the third piece is for loan production i mentioned on the call a couple of times in the last few quarters is that provision each quarter would be in that million to million range and so if the economic outlook doesnt change and if the migration is consistent with expectations that would imply about a million per quarter provision expense on average and about million for the year which would be below what that chargeoff guidance would imply and so we would expect to see that allowance ratio come down over time and could have some opportunity to see that come down more quickly if we continue to see the credit migration outperform like we have gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for those insights and chris a bigger question for you or a bigger picture obviously key and your peers are positioned to really benefit from a recovery in the us economy coming hopefully this year as the vaccines are more widespread by the summertime the stock shares included since the pfizer announcement in november have had a real strong run here and so everything is shaping out good and as you pointed out your fourth quarter investment banking numbers were blockbuster when you go home at night and you go down the elevator what are the risks that you think about since things are shaping up pretty good for you and your peers as we look out over the next months christopher m a gorman chairman president chief executive officer keycorp gerard i think for our entire industry the number one risk is cyber i think were in the trust business and to the extent there was a significant breach in the industry or of any particular company i think that is i think thats the number one risk the number two risk i think that we all need to focus on are just a whole another cadre of competitors if you think about a lot of the fintechs and you think about what some of those companies have been able to do in terms of garnering new clients i think that is a strategic risk kind of more tactically we think about sort of the key areas where i think you could see significant degradation in asset values and fortunately were well positioned here but i think the obvious ones are travel and keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 entertainment i think thats as you point out i think that that will come back because i think the vaccine has a lot to do with that i think the hospitality industry is one that you need to focus on the other couple of areas and as you know weve been out of them by strategy is both retail and office i think those are areas that as an industry we need to keep a close eye on so those are kind of starting with sort of strategic down to tactical what i think about gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you christopher m a gorman chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you operator our next question is from erika najarian with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc yes hi my first question im sorry for another question on your net interest income outlook but im wondering if you could give us a sense don on what level of cash deployment or what level of investment securities growth you would expect for and maybe this next one is for chris embedded in that net interest income outlook how do you see core commercial loans exppp trending throughout the year within your guidance it seems like a lot of peers have been quite optimistic surprising the market on loan growth recovery particularly in the second half of the year donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp sure as far as the outlook for net interest income and some of the assumptions we have there for the reinvestment in the fourth quarter we increased our core investment portfolio by about billion and that was investing at a faster pace than the runoff and i would and our outlook would have some of that same type of pace continuing throughout the current year that were currently sitting on over billion in cash and about billion in tbills that we think would be available for us to continue to redeploy either through loan growth or through reinvestment and so that would be the core assumption that we have there just on that component that for the roughly billion that we invested this quarter the average reinvestment yield was about so down from what the runoff level would be but reflected some of the strategy as far as investing in certain securities and then swapping them back so that say years down the road those fixed rate securities would convert over to floating rate so our expectation would be to continue that kind of a strategy going forward chris on commercial loan growth christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 sure erika so a couple of things as don mentioned loan growth first of all consumer is an area that will continue to be an outlier of growth for us and i think were well positioned for that next area if you think about commercial real estate we have a very very good franchise were actually not growing the onbalance sheet debt there and thats by strategy i think last year we probably placed billion with our targeted customers in our real estate book as it relates to ci we havent yet seen growth if youre looking at utilization erika it is now at or below even prepandemic we havent seen people investing in property plant equipment investing in people but what we have seen and i think is a very good sign and you saw it in our investment banking numbers in the fourth quarter is people are starting to make strategic moves and so were having great strategic discussions with our clients and our prospects and i think people are thinking now with the election behind us with the vaccine rollout of really what are they going to do to grow their business so i too am optimistic that well see an increase in line utilization and that well see people start to invest in their business the other thing that would obviously be helpful for line utilization because if we had a bit of inflation if people actually started investing and going long in inventory and i dont think thats an unrealistic scenario as you think about the back half of the year erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one followup question on expenses don your guidance is off of the gaap base of billion donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thats correct yes erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc great thank you donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator our next question is from john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp hi john pancari q analyst evercore isi i appreciate the color you gave on the reinvestment and the impact of liquidity as well as your nii guidance just wanted to see if you can help us in how to think about the trajectory of the net interest margin here in the coming quarters i know theres also a ppp benefit but just want to see if you can give us a lot of color in terms of how that could trend in the next coming quarters thanks donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp well good as far as the margin its challenging to predict just because the timing of some of the deposit flows is also creating either pressure or change there and so with our assumption of having deposits growing low single digits that implies that our margin will come down slightly from where it is as of the fourth quarter so something slightly below the million and i would say that from quartertoquarter that will be impacted based on like you said the ppp forgiveness timing and also the changes in the overall liquidity position john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thanks that helps and then separately chris just wanted to get your updated thoughts on ma interest both bank and nonbank weve clearly seen some banks there in your backyard move on some deals and i know youve flagged competition as one of the risks that you think about and you can certainly see that intensifying in the coming years so basically i want to get your thoughts on whole bank ma from that perspective and then also on the nonbank front thanks christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure thanks for your question well my comment with respect to intensity of competitors was really nonbanks and thinking about some of the fintechs but as it relates specifically to your question were not really focused on whole bank consolidation or acquisitions really at all we think we have everything we need to be successful we think the best way for us to generate value is to execute our targeted scale and go out and grow organically so having said that obviously we take the responsibility very seriously of being a public company and we know we have to go out there each and every day and create value as it relates to nonbanks im really proud of the job weve done over many years of being able to buy entrepreneurial firms and successfully integrating them into our business and i think about cain brothers i think about pacific crest securities and most recently laurel road that was a born digital company that weve been able to really not only integrate into our business but actually helps key grow helps as both key and laurel road have grown so i think youll see us continue to go out in keeping with our focus around targeted scale buying these niche businesses that can help us really serve our targeted client bases john pancari q analyst evercore isi thats helpful what areas of businesses would you emphasize in terms of the nonbanks keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp i think wed probably look at the verticals that were in and i think we also would probably look at if you think lets look at what weve done weve bought boutiques that are really focused weve bought digital businessesanalytics businesses those are the kind of businesses that i think really turbocharge our existing million clients john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks chris operator our next question is from steve alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hello this is janet lee on for steve alexopoulos so my first question is on deposits youre guiding to deposits going up even more from here after growth in is this a function of your customers still holding on to cash in their account or does this bake in any assumption about new client acquisitions from your successful ppp donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp i would say its on all fronts and so we are assuming a growth on a continued basis one is that we in the last three quarters have shown a lot of strong retail household growth and with a focus there on primary operating accounts for the retail customers throughout our commercial customer base we have increased efforts around making sure that we have that expanded full depositoryoperating account relationship there as well and so those will be helpful it would also reflect the assumptions like we saw last year that as the ppp loans were originated a good portion of those proceeds were deposited into deposit accounts with our customers and so we would expect to see some lift from that and then just the most recent round of stimulus also adds deposit balances and each quarter this year weve tried to estimate where our deposit flows will be and i think each quarter we probably underestimated where they actually come through and so i think the customers continue to have liquidity and continue to build those positions and thats essentially why were assuming that well have continued growth there as well christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp don the only thing i would add to that is we have a very successful thirdparty commercial loan servicing business where we are named primary servicer on billion worth of commercial real estate that business has grown very very well and that generates deposits and we also from a strategic perspective are very focused on primacy with both our consumer clients and our commercial clients and were getting a lot of lift there janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 thats helpful and its positively surprising to hear that you expect overall residential mortgage originations to remain stable to potentially increase in versus so do you are you saying that the consumer mortgage income line on your fee income is that going to be stable or is it going to go down like single digits and how does it fit into the overall fee income guidance of up low single digits like where are the other like offsetting line items that are going to see bigger drop christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yes as far as the outlook for that we would expect that line item to come down slightly more reflecting the impact of the extremely high levels of gain on sale we experienced especially in the third quarter of this year so we saw that come down in the fourth quarter and would expect to see ongoing pressure there so even though the origination volumes would be stable to maybe up we would expect to see some pressure there as far as the other categories on fee income that we would expect good growth in service charge line item that those categories were under pressure throughout a good portion of the say second and third quarter of and we would expect to see growth coming from that category and especially reflecting the impact of the low rates we would expect to see good growth in trust and investment services line item between what were doing from a retail and commercial brokerageaccount activity there and just our overall investment management strategy we would expect to see some growth there and then even though weve had a record year for investment banking and debt placement fees we do expect that to grow again for and so weve got a good pipeline in that business we got a good team and were expecting to add bankers to that area throughout as well which will help deliver those results also janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thanks for taking my questions christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you operator and well go to peter winter with wedbush securities please go ahead peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i just wanted to followup on line utilization where is it today and where do you think it can go and kind of whats the sensitivity for every increase to commercial loans keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp so this is chris this is an area that frankly through the pandemic weve been challenged to really pin down on where we think its going to go if you think about people drawing on their lines and then paying back those draws were about at in our ci book right now which peter is a little bit below where we would have been pre pandemic and i think the real catalyst there is one our clients are sitting on a lot of cash so arguably well have to burn down some of their cash before they start to utilize their lines so they have elevated cash positions thats the first thing and the second thing that i mentioned is theres plenty of slack now in the global supply chains and so people arent really investing and going long per se on inventory so i think youd need those two things to happen the biggest driver of both of those obviously is to get real economic growth don what would you add to that donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp no i think thats right i mean as far as the that implies roughly about billion in outstanding balances on those lines for us so just to put that in perspective if that would increase by and thats which shows that growth on the billion peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thats helpful and then just one question just on net interest income the outlook of low singledigits that is on a gaap basis as well is that right donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp im sorry repeat that please peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc sure sorry the fee income outlook the base thats a gaap number donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp the base is the gaap number and our fte adjustment isnt assuming much of a change on a yearover year basis there but i guess we would have a tax rate change we would start to see that but it runs usually about million to million a quarter a year excuse me a year for the fte adjustment peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay got it thank you operator and with no further questions in queue ill turn it back to the company for any closing comments keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 christopher m gorman chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thanks john again we thank you for participating in
