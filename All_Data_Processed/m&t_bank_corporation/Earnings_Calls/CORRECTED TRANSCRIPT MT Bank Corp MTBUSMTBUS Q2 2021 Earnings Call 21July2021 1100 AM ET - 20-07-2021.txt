right now brian klock headmarkets and investor relations mt bank corp you got it i mean darren darren j king chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp all right lets jump into the business of the day as we noted in this mornings press release we were pleased with the continued rebound in the economy from the pandemicinduced slowdown we continue to see improved customer activity across all sectors of the economy notably while not back to prepandemic levels were seeing mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 improvements in the leisure and hospitality sectors while nonaccrual and criticized loans increased from prior quarter loss emergence remains subdued leading us to recognize a further moderate release from the allowance for credit losses the balance sheet continues to strengthen as both capital and liquidity grew from already elevated levels positioning the bank to continue to be a source of strength for our customers we continue to make progress towards the fourth quarter close of the peoples united merger and we were pleased with the overwhelming shareholder support of the combination looking at the results for the quarter diluted gaap earnings per common share were for the second quarter of improved from in the first quarter of and in the second quarter of net income for the quarter was million compared with million in the linked quarter and million in the yearago quarter on a gaap basis mts second quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of and an annualized rate of return on average common equity of this compares with rates of and respectively in the previous quarter included in gaap results in the recent quarter were aftertax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to million or per common share little change from the prior quarter also included in the quarters results were mergerrelated charges of million related to mts proposed acquisition of peoples united financial this amounted to million after tax or per common share results for this years first quarter included million of such charges amounting to million aftertax effect or per common share consistent with our longterm practice mt provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the aftertax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions mts net operating income for the second quarter which excludes intangible amortization and the merger related expenses was million compared with million in the linked quarter and million in last years second quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share were for the recent quarter up from in 2021s first quarter and up from in the second quarter of net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and for the recent quarter the comparable returns were and in the first quarter of in accordance with the secs guidelines this mornings press release contains a tabular reconciliation of gaap and nongaap results including tangible assets and equity now lets take a look at some of the underlying details in our results taxable equivalent net interest income was million in the second quarter of compared with million in the linked quarter a decrease in ppp related income accounted for approximately half of the quarteroverquarter decrease in net interest income as the first round of ppp loans continues to wind down the net interest margin for the past quarter was down basis points from in the linked quarter higher levels of cash on deposit at the federal reserve continued to contribute pressure to the margin which we estimate accounted for basis points of the decline from the first quarter lower fee amortization from the ppp loan portfolio both scheduled amortization and accelerated recognition from forgiven loans contributed about basis points of the margin pressure mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 the impact of interest rates primarily lower income from our hedge program partially offset by a lower cost of deposits accounted for about basis points of the decline all other factors accounted for some4 basis points of margin pressure compared with the first quarter of average earning assets increased by some2 reflecting a increase in money market placements primarily cash on deposit at the fed and a decline in investable securities average loans outstanding declined just under compared with the previous quarter looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter overall commercial and industrial loans declined by million or dealer floor plan loans declined by million reflecting the well documented auto production and inventory issues experienced by the industry due to the late first quarter timing of round originations and delays in forgiveness of loans over million in size average ppp loans declined by less than million from the prior quarter all other ci loan categories grew slightly over commercial real estate loans declined by about similar to what we saw in the first quarter we continue to see very low levels of customer activity residential real estate loans declined by weve seen little opportunity for additional buyouts of loans from ginnie mae servicing pools as delinquency and payment trends continue to improve absent those the ongoing runoff of acquired hudson city mortgage loans continues at a moderate pace consumer loans were up consistent with recent quarters as growth in indirect auto and recreation finance loans has been outpacing declines in home equity lines and loans on an endofperiod basis total loans were down reflecting the same factors i just mentioned ppp loans totaled billion at june compared with billion at the end of the first quarter average core customer deposits which exclude deposits received at mts cayman islands office and cds over increased over or billion compared with the first quarter that figure includes billion of noninterestbearing deposits on an endofperiod basis core deposits were up by just under million ill note here that the repeal of the prohibition of paying interest on commercial checking deposits has led us to reconsider the need for a cayman islands office it held no deposits at the end of the quarter turning to noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in the second quarter compared with million in the linked quarter the recent quarter included million of valuation losses on equity securities largely on our remaining holdings of gse preferred stock while the prior quarter included million of such valuation losses mortgage banking revenues were million in the recent quarter compared with million in the linked quarter revenues for our residential mortgage business including both origination and servicing activities were million in the second quarter compared with million in the prior quarter lower gain on sale margins were the primary driver of the decline in addition residential mortgage loans originated for sale were down about to billion compared with the first quarter commercial mortgage banking revenues were million in the second quarter compared with million in the linked quarter trust income rose to million in the recent quarter improved from million in the previous quarter this quarters results included million of seasonal fees arising from tax preparation work we undertake for clients as well as the result of growth in assets under management in the wealth and institutional businesses service charges on deposit accounts were million compared with million in the first quarter the primary driver of the increase were customer payments related activity mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 turning to expenses operating expenses for the second quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and mergerrelated expenses were million the comparable figure was million in the linked quarter salaries and benefits declined by million to million from the prior quarter recall that the first quarters results included million of seasonal salary and benefit cost our deposit insurance increased by million to million during the quarter primarily reflecting higher levels of criticized loans which factor into the fdics assessment calculation other costs of operations for the past quarter included an million addition to the valuation allowance on our capitalized mortgage servicing rights recall there was a million reversal from the allowance in 2021s first quarter the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was in the recent quarter compared with in 2021s first quarter which included the seasonally elevated compensation costs next lets turn to credit as i noted at the start of the call were pleased with the signs of spending and revenue trends for our customers as the overall economy continues to improve that said some industries are improving more rapidly than others and the supply chain issues and pressures on costs go beyond just the automotive sector the allowance for credit losses declined by million to billion at the end of the second quarter that reflects a million recapture of previous provisions for credit losses combined with million of net charge offs in the quarter the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans outstanding declined to that ratio was little changed from of loans at the end of the prior quarter annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of loans were basis points for the second quarter compared with basis points in the first quarter the allowance for credit losses at the end of the quarter reflects our assessment of credit losses in the portfolio under the cecl loss measurement methodology which includes our macroeconomic forecast as weve previously indicated our macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables with the largest drivers being the unemployment rate and gdp our forecast assumes the national unemployment rate continues to be at elevated levels on average through followed by a gradual improvement reaching by mid2023 the forecast assumes that gdp grows at a annual rate during resulting in gdp returning to prepandemic levels during nonaccrual loans increased by million to billion or of loans at the end of june this was up from at the end of march we expect to disclose an increase in criticized loans with our second quarter 10q filing this reflects the prolonged recovery in certain sectors of the economy notably hospitality and healthcare mts commercial loan grades reflect the performance of individual properties with limited consideration of property values or guarantor ability to sustain cash flows from other sources notwithstanding those increases loss emergence on troubled loans continues to be moderate interest reserves are healthy sponsors remain supportive and collateral values are well within our underwriting assumptions the allowance for credit losses continues to reflect our ultimate loss expectations loans days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were billion at the end of the recent quarter and of these loans were guaranteed by governmentrelated entities mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 turning to capital mts common equity tier ratio was an estimated compared with at the end of the first quarter and which reflects lower riskweighted assets and earnings net of dividends as previously noted while the peoples united merger is pending we dont plan to engage in any stock repurchase activity now turning to the outlook as we reach the halfway point of the year the cautious outlook we conveyed on the january and april earnings calls has been well aligned with what were actually seeing the fiscal and monetary stimulus programs along with the vaccination programs have clearly brought a turnaround in economic growth and employment but the downside effects from these actions continues excess liquidity in the system has suppressed loan growth particularly commercial loans for mt in the broader industry customer deposits are at alltime highs and grew faster than our ability to deploy them into assets that earn above our cost of capital the fundamental aspects of our outlook havent changed total loan growth roughly flat on a yearoveryear basis excluding the ppp loans with pressure on ci especially dealer floor plan and cre loans being offset by growth in consumer loans net interest income down lowsingle digit percentage from full year lowsingle digit growth in total fees we see the potential for a slowdown in mortgage banking in the second half offset by stronger trust income paymentsrelated fees and commercial loan fees expenses for the first half of the year have been mostly in line with our expectations with yearoveryear growth largely attributable to expenses directly tied to revenue growth such as entrust and to higher corporate incentive accruals coming as a result of improved overall profitability compared to last year as these trends continue together with costs associated with the reopening of the economy and costs incurred in preparation for the peoples united merger we expect there to be a little more pressure on expenses in the second half of the credit environment continues to improve along with the overall economy but some segments are recovering more slowly than others were encouraged by the progress were seeing in our hospitality portfolio with respect to bookings and cash flows but that sectors return to normal will lag the overall economy lastly the planned merger with peoples united remains on track and our estimated time line for approval by the regulators closing and integration remains unchanged of course as you are aware our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth changes in interest rates political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future now lets open the call to questions before which erica will briefly review the instructions mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i just if i could just followup on the outlook for expenses being pressured in the back half when i look at second quarter we grew about yearoveryear give us a sense of how we should think about it like should back half be higher than first half levels in terms of what we saw in expenses any color around that would be helpful darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah sure i guess when you look at the quarter comparison in the second quarter versus second quarter last year that was when the economy shut down and everything stopped so youre in for a larger expense increase there in that quarter looking at a yearoveryear basis when we think about the whole year and where well go for the second half the things that were looking at is were looking at some increase in feerelated expenses as we continue to see those fee categories grow were looking at as i mentioned before continued increase in our incentive accrual based on the performance of the bank and so you recall that last year we reduced the incentive paid to our senior folks based on the performance of the bank and then the other place where youll see some growth is as we continue to make our investments in technology and prepare for the peoples integration so well probably see some expense pressure in the third quarter well call out whats related specifically to the merger because some of those will either be onetime or they could in fact be expenses that will start maybe a quarter earlier than we might have thought as we prepare for the for legal day one and for the conversion but overall the expense growth that we saw this quarter we wouldnt be running at that high of a rate for the whole year certainly not excluding the impact of the peoples merger id be thinking more in the i dont know to taking into account the corporate incentives as well as the growth in some of the fee businesses ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thats helpful and i guess just on a separate topic rené last quarter you provided some color around the hospitality book im just wondering if youve seen any improvement in terms of the debt servicing for these borrowers and i understand you dont expect credit losses stemming from this portfolio but how will that inform mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 your ability to get back to sort of ph season on reserve levels as you think about the next few quarters thank you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah sure i guess the way were looking at it and thinking about it is when we look at the criticized portfolio were really focusing on the standalone cash flows of each of the properties in each of the each of those specific i guess call it pieces of collateral because with many of our relationships our clients will have multiple properties and so we look at each property and we assess its ability to cash flow and thats what affects the criticized balances when you look at actual losses just because theyre struggling many of them are actually still earning interest and accruing interest because the sponsors have outside sources that theyre bringing to support the deals and then the other thing were looking at is we keep getting updated appraisals on loans and properties that we have both in criticized and particularly in nonaccrual and whats been a pleasant surprise is when we look at the recent approval appraisals that have come in theyve been very strong weve seen valuations that i believe were on a fully as is basis that are above well above our loan cost and on a stabilized basis that are maybe down from the original appraisals and so when we think about the loss content in the portfolio which is reflected in our allowance we feel quite comfortable with whats there the question obviously will be the timing on when the cash flows get to a point where we would see them as not criticized any longer we are seeing improvements in occupancy rates in the hotel portfolio across the board but were not quite back to prepandemic levels there mainly because business travel hasnt resumed or seeing good performance in leisure travel but not as strong yet in business and so as those vacancy rates come down and revenue per available night or available room comes up well see those assets go from criticized back into performing and then that will support further reductions in the allowance ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thanks good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc actually id love to stay on the whole reserve question or topic for just a second more obviously you the amount of reserves that you released this quarter is very small i mean certainly relative to what weve seen at a number of other banks i know you cant necessarily comment on how you differ from other banks or but i am mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 kind of curious any color you have on like what assumptions that youre making that might explain the differences in your sort of your limited reserve release versus everyone else or maybe its not assumptions at all it really is like this big criticized portfolio that youre talking about any color would be helpful thank you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure no happy to go into some of the details there i guess a couple of broad thoughts to start the cecl methodology is a lot more penal on consumer books than on commercial books because they tend to be longer dated and our institution as you are aware skews more commercial thats one it also is has a big impact on credit card portfolios and credit card at mt is not a huge part of our book of business and so when you look at some of what was being done last year in reserving what you saw was much larger additions to allowance than you would have seen at mt because of those mix differences and so now when were going in the other direction the releases are also higher for those same reasons and so when you look inside our portfolio and just to give you a little flavor on the allowance its obviously its a collection of the different asset classes and the loss expectations in those assets and so if you think about ci the ci provision there was a little bit of a release or recapture because there was a decrease in the loans outstanding because of the auto floor plan right and so that was as much a function of a decrease in assets as it was the loss rate on the assets within the real estate portfolio we continue to have a loss assumption thats pretty much unchanged and there was a slight uptick there because of the increase in or the size of the criticized portfolio if you look in the mortgage book it was a decrease again because of the reduction in the assets as well as the continued great performance of home prices which affect the model and the loss expectations and so there was a decrease there and then in the other consumer portfolio it was actually an increase because of the growth in balances offset a little bit by strong used car prices which brought the loss rate down a little bit and so theres different pieces in each of the portfolios that will move the allowance either up or down it could be because of economic factors it could be because of the balance but those are some of the dynamics that are happening underneath and hopefully that helps give a little bit more color to whats happening with the allowance ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc it does thats perfect thank you and then just maybe a followup question in terms of the securities portfolio i certainly understand your rationale for not wanting to invest in very low yielding securities at this point at what point might that change or and how low could the securities portfolio go before you feel like you need to invest at least something thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah sure i was waiting for this conversation i got to listen to rené last time on the same subject when you look at where we sit today ill talk about the securities portfolio but also just some of the other parts of the bank we just talked about the reserve and where the reserve sits relative to cecl day one when we look at our underwriting and our losses or expectations to me we are adequately reserved if not maybe a little bit more and thats future potential you look at our capital ratios at were probably going to mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 print near the high of the peers in terms of that ratio and well hold on to that until we do the merger thats untapped potential and i see the securities portfolio the same way and so weve been allowing that to run off i think what well youll start to see is as we start to think about maintaining it where it is and then look as we prepare to merge with peoples and if you whats on our mind as we think about how and when to deploy that excess cash its a combination of just replacing some of the cash with securities in our own book but what the combined balance sheet is going to look like and so peoples will bring a higher percentage of securities and cash which will balance us out a little bit and theyll also bring a bigger onbalance sheet consumer mortgage portfolio as a percentage of their assets because theyve tended to be an originateandhold shop where weve been an originateandsell and so the combination of those two factors when we combine the portfolios will start to bring down some of our asset sensitivity and based on that combined portfolio well start to think about how we want to deploy that cash into what types of securities and what type of durations we might want to add so it could be through the securities portfolio itself with mortgage backs it could be just retaining mortgages and getting the same exposure but having it on the balance sheet in an htm as opposed to an afs type of portfolio and so those are the things that were looking at and well look to do other things we can to optimize the cash looking to reduce borrowings well continue to reduce time deposits which will get some additional ones with peoples but i think as we look forward our belief is that the deposits are probably going to stick around a little bit longer than we might have anticipated which is affecting our thinking about deploying and the duration that we want to assume and what percentage of the cash we want to put to work but i think were probably at a point where we start to see that securities portfolio level off and well be selective about jumping in but well probably keep it roughly where it is ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi just a question on the margin front wanted to see if you can baked into your net interest income expectation for a lowsingle digit decline in how should we think about margin trajectory underlying that going forward from here obviously on an underlying basis clearly the peoples deal would impact that but wanted to see if you can elaborate a little bit on the standalone margin expectation thanks mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah its a tricky one john and so when i think about the net interest income the reason ive been explicit and weve been explicit about talking about that dollar number as opposed to the margin is theres a lot of things that are going to bounce the margin around that dont affect the dollars right so first and foremost is cash and were still in a place where each extra billion of cash compresses the margin by to basis points but it actually adds a nominal amount to net interest income the other thing that bounces the net interest margin around is just the pace of forgiveness on the ppp loans and when you look at the first or the last four quarters weve really seen the bulk of round ppp loans forgiven and so when you accelerate that origination fee obviously that affects the net interest income and the margin but isnt necessarily repeatable and so when we think about the full year guide for net interest income down lowsingle digit factored in there is the earning assets which weve talked about where we think those will be and if you go underneath and look at the actual loan spreads and deposit costs those are pretty stable and that portfolio is producing a pretty stable stream of net interest income and the movements are generally caused certainly in the nim by cash by the pace of ppp and then ultimately the hedge portfolio that weve talked about i think for several quarters now that its out there the notional amount outstanding hasnt changed its still around billion but the effective yield is coming down each quarter and so that will put a little bit of pressure on the net interest margin and ultimately net interest income but as i at least look through the next couple quarters on a standalone basis i think net interest income is roughly around where it was this quarter john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks thats helpful and before i ask my second question i have to acknowledge the marv levy quote darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp i appreciate that hes one of our favorites john pancari q analyst evercore isi not a bills fan but got to acknowledge it and then just separately on the loan growth outlook for the relatively flat expectation for the year can you just talk about when do you see an inflection in balances as we look over the next couple quarters is an inflection in the near term can you see an inflection in the back half as consumer offsets the continued declines in ci and cre darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i think youll start to see it but its going to be nuanced and its not going to be obvious and the reason its going to be that way is theres two portfolios that we have that are going to cause a top line decrease in loans so first and foremost is ppp which is well documented right and we know weve got now billion at the end of the quarter thats going to run off and will depend on the pace of forgiveness but theres reason to believe that mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 that will happen in the next three or four quarters and then theres also the ginnie mae buyouts that weve added on to the balance sheet to use up some of that excess liquidity because we like the duration and the yield on that and as the economy continues to improve its our expectation that we will actually those will become reperforming and they will get packaged and sold back as securities and that will bring down those mortgage balances but obviously will drive some fee income and so when you look underneath the portfolio back to some of the trends that we had talked about exfloor plan ci was actually up modestly and we did see a very slight uptick in utilization rates of ci lines in the quarter and we will see production come back in the auto sector and well see some of those floor plan balances growing again just for context our current line utilization in the or in the auto floor plan space is about half of its longterm average and so that by itself is worth a couple billion dollars and so well see that start to come back we think it will be really first quarter of next year and then when you look in the real estate space not surprisingly theres not a lot of activity going on and usually what drives some of the cre growth and declines is just activity in assets changing hands and when that happens is both a positive and a negative we see payoffs because some of our clients sell but we also gain assets when construction projects come online or come due andor when our clients are out looking at assets and growing their portfolios and so right now thats pretty subdued and expect that the cre balances will be kind of flattish maybe slightly down as we work our way through and then the big growth is in the consumer portfolio when i say big that sounds more grandiose than it is its consistent growth in the auto floor plan or auto indirect as well as recfi and auto and recfi sorry so its there i like the trends that we see the spreads are still holding up the returns in the business were booking are solid and so we dont feel a need to chase it but need to be there to support our clients with what their activities are and it will largely reflect the economy john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks very helpful darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thanks john and thanks for the marv levy reference we got room on the bandwagon for more build spend okay john pancari q analyst evercore isi sure thing operator and your next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks hey good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning ken kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc darren wanted to follow up and ask to a point about the eventual resecuritizations on the ginnie maes i was wondering if you could just help us understand how big is that book in the loan book now and if youre fee guide for down lowsingle digit contemplates getting some of that resecuritization income back into fees this year darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure so if you look at the ginnie mae portfolio lets call it billion to billion that will ultimately get resecuritized and sold the pace is a little bit unknown right now as the foreclosure moratoriums keep getting extended that gets pushed out when we gave the original guide about fee growth in lowsingle digits that contemplated some degree of gain on sale coming from that portfolio thats been pushed out a little bit one of the things that happens on the other side though is as long as those assets sit on our balance sheet were accruing interest income and so thats helping with the net interest income and when we look at the potential gain on sale it will move the percentage growth in fee income maybe a percentage point and it would be towards the fourth quarter of the year not likely much before then just given what were seeing and the time it takes to get those securities considered reperforming and available for sale so it will be backend loaded and start to spill into kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes understood and just a followup question its great to see the trust business continuing to rebound up another im just wondering can you just talk through just some of the underlying growth drivers in trust and do you have the what the fee waivers were this quarter and if you expect that those would have peaked and maybe we get a little bit of held back on those going forward given the ioer changes thank you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah let me make sure i got all these so ill start with trust and then ill talk about the waivers so were really pleased with how things are progressing in the trust business theres really two main drivers of the trust fee income in the last few quarters our wealth team has really done a great job with leveraging the changes that they made to their platform to be out and growing new customers which is very encouraging and then for the existing customers plus the new ones everybody is benefiting from the capital markets and the growth there and another piece of our trust business is we manage assets on behalf of retirement plans and as we manage those assets its a great business because each month employees contribute more to their plan were signing mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 up new employers and the markets been growing and so the combination of those three things is driving growth in assets under management which is leading to top line keep in mind this is where i say were seeing expense growth that in many cases were a fiduciary of those were not the underlying asset manager and so theres a subadviser fee that doesnt get netted against the trust fee income its in the other expense line and so as we grow those assets under management we like the returns in that business and we like the profit it adds but it does cause expenses to go up at the same time and so thats why we want to say theres expense growth related to fee growth thats one of the big drivers when we look at the waivers in the funds its in the neighborhood of call it at the high end million a quarter is where we are today and what it will take to get back in there we probably need i think we need fed funds up probably closer to basis points before you see that start to materialize as opposed to the first so this would be another one of these things when i look forward and i think about what the potential is for the bank in addition to the things we talked about with cash and capital and the provision obviously the waivers is another one that can turn around so lots of latent potential we just need to unlock it kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah got it thank you darren operator your next question is from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc good morning good to have you back darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thanks bill nice to be back bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc as ppp balances wind down is there an opportunity to grow your small business lending into other markets outside of your traditional footprint perhaps by partnering with other financial technology players or doing a bolt on type deal like weve seen from others more broadly the question is i guess just any color that you can give on the extent to which youre considering these kinds of moves across any of your business lines darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure and great question small business is one of the cornerstones of mt and who weve been for years in the communities that we serve i think the number one opportunity that sits in front of us is peoples we mentioned it on the announcement of the deal and the more we get to know our new colleagues at peoples and the geographies we continue to be excited about the upside there and that bringing our brand of small business banking to that franchise is really exciting and we have been watching with great interest whats been happening with nationwide small business lending and i have the benefit of i used to actually run that division in a prior career here at mt and weve seen people come in and out of that business a lot mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 and one of the things that always excited me in that business was when peoples announced they were getting in because its tough and one of the things thats really important to remember about small business is that small business loans are okay business but the real value is in the deposits and the small business franchise is actually selffunding and so one of the tricks and when you talk about nationwide small business lending what were watching is not the ability to give out money because thats easy but the ability to make sure that you risk rate it that you take care of fraud which we saw some fraud in some of the ppp situations and then ultimately your ability to win the whole relationship and so if you think about mt and our approach to banking its always been full relationship banking and one of the keys is having weve always talked about the operating account of our customers whether its consumers whether its small business or middlemarket companies and thats a little bit of a tougher proposition on a nationwide and remote basis but its something that we watch and fortunately we had a very strong ppp showing and we were able to win some new relationships in our footprint and for now i think well focus primarily on capturing the upside that we see in the new markets that come with the peoples combination bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thanks for taking my question darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp erica well move into the next question operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi darren welcome back into the seat darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning gerard thanks gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i thought for a minute they just dropped me off with that long delay but im glad you picked up a couple of questions for you we all and you referenced it in your prepared remarks about floor plan lending and whats going on in the auto industry and the supply issues in other industries as well the question is this autos in particular you won there are some stories that have been written recently that maybe the auto dealers may follow what theyre doing today into the future meaning keeping a lower inventory and having higher margins so maybe they sell fewer units but the margins are higher that may be a way to go are you hearing anything like that from your guys on the front line who deal with the auto dealers that the normal inventory levels and the normal floor plan lending will come back or maybe it will not come back mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp gerard its a great question and its one that comes up often it tends to come up a little bit more in other business circles than with the dealers i mean they obviously they love the situation that were in right now because of the how quickly the cars are moving off the lot the thing that you got to keep in mind especially as it relates to the auto business is a lot of the production is pushed by the manufacturer and while we do a lot of floor plan with the dealers generally the new car production is floored by the manufacturer and the manufacturer will actually have incentives and will buy back cars that dont sell and so theres whats on the dealers lot and what theyd like to do and then theres what the manufacturing industry or part of the value chain wants to do and i think the last sar if my memory is correct printed around million and it averaged about million prepandemic and so thats a lot of production thats not there right now and one of the other elements of the production that happens is it goes from the manufacturer to the dealer and some of the unused inventory ends up in rental agencies and obviously that was an industry that early on was hit pretty hard by the pandemic but seems to be coming back at least if any of you have tried to rent a car lately youll find one its difficult and two its really expensive and so i think as some of that production comes back youll see it move its way through the lots and back into the rental car companies so probably more insight or information than you wanted in the response but i dont think it will stay this way because i think there are other forces at play that are unique to auto its a different world in refi where the manufacturers dont have that same power and the dealers themselves have more control over inventory and the lots and obviously that sector has been through a big change through the pandemic as well but i think we will see a rebound in auto floor plan lines will they get usage i should say will they get all the way back to where they were i guess that remains to be seen but it will be a function i think of the ability of the manufactures to ramp up production gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good i appreciate the insights coming back to your comments about your average balance sheet and you talked about the deposits at the fed your securities et cetera i dont know if youre able to do this but when you look at your spread i think this quarter was your margin was of course and you look at the different categories of asset yields how far away is the current market your incremental loan that you make or the incremental security that you purchased to the actual averages that youre showing in the third quarter is it a or basis point difference on the incremental new asset production versus what your averages are showing darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp so when you look at when i look at rollon and rolloff margins what weve seen for probably the last six to nine months is rollon margins have been better than rolloff margins and so that bodes well for the portfolio over the long run but what weve also been seeing in the last few quarters is the spread or call it abnormal spread i dont know is coming back closer to what it was prepandemic and so youll see over time spread which is really the piece that matters to most of us coming back to prepandemic levels but hopefully not below but in the last little while what weve seen is rollon better than rolloff mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 im cautioning a little bit because when i think about the press release and i think about the page in the press release that talks about yield and particularly on ci theres a lot of movement in there right now because thats where all the ppp fees are rolling in and out of and so thats why were getting some wild swings in margin there and then when we look at the cre yield thats where some of the hedge would be but when you take all that stuff away and just look at whats actually in the portfolio the yields and im sorry the spreads over the last year have been a little bit better than what they were going into the pandemic theyre trending back there and so i would think that over time our longterm average yield or spread would be similar to what it was prepandemic and as we start to deploy some of that cash hopefully into things other than securities in but into supporting customers that we continue to see a net interest margin that in the long run prints in the top quartile of the peers as has been our history gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good appreciate it again welcome back darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thanks gerard operator your next question is from the line of christopher spahr with wells fargo christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc good afternoon so my questions are techrelated so whats your outlook for your tech budget over the next say three to five years in the past you said tech cost is around lowdouble digits of revenues but given the challenging rate environment and the pending peoples deal i was just wondering what you think it will be post merger and then what are the incremental investments in light of the comments you had for the second quarter and then as a followup ill just give that now whats the mix of this budget in terms of run versus change the bank before the pandemic we kind of estimated it was around as you focused on reducing customer friction and improving processes thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp all right let me make sure i got im trying to keep up with you chris on the list here so tech budget things that were focused on and spending and kind of mix of build the bank versus run the bank did i miss anything there christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc correct no no thats pretty much it thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 okay so i guess ill just start with what we saw in quarteroverquarter when we look in that software and data processing line theres two elements there one is contracts that we have where we pay a fee based on volume and so as some of the data processing volumes increase so will that fee and thats one of the drivers and then the other one in there is software licenses and what we tend to find is the first quarter is a little bit light on that and it tends to catch up as the year goes on some of the licenses will grow as we prepare for peoples because well be buying additional licenses for the peoples employees whether its for commercial loan rms whether its for the branches or staff employees and you might see that a little bit in advance of the merger and those would not be considered onetime expenses but they would have been contemplated in our due diligence and so youll see some of that and then the other thing that happens is as you shift more of your technology into asp or cloudbased environment that you pay more in kind of monthly or quarterly fees versus the upfront investment cost and so its a little bit of a shift and so that impacts the growth of the overall tech budget right that youll have a higher tech budget if youre kind of building your own software versus buying offtheshelf the difference is it costs you a little bit less upfront but then youve got the tail of the ongoing software licensing costs and so when we look at our tech budget and how its grown over the last several years its been highsingle digit compound annual growth rates when you look over the last five years theres times when it moves up and we invest a little bit more and times when it levels off but i think thats a pretty good estimate of where weve been and likely where were going and the focus is across build the bank and run the bank its i think thats a good number and way to think about it whether its run versus improve or build can shift in time some of the things that youre investing in or were investing in include data data quality data warehousing cybersecurity risk management things which i guess are build the bank but could be considered run the bank depending on how you qualify them but theyre just part of being a larger institution as weve noted were focused on things that improve the customer experience whether its been the mobile app whether its been improving the interactions that happen in the call center whether its providing better technology to the branch teams we made some big upgrades to our cash management system weve made big upgrades to our loan origination systems to try and help the commercial rms and make their lives easier and so its across those types of investments that youre seeing us spend our dollars and i think tech budgets are just part of banking theyre going to be there its hard to separate technology from banking these days but that doesnt mean its the only part of banking as well reemphasize that weve always been a bank in our communities where our folks and the personal touch and relationship management matters and the technology is there to complement that approach and to make our teams that much more effective with clients christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator your next question is from dave rochester with compass point david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 hey good morning guys or now good afternoon i guess how are you doing darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes good afternoon david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah just a quick one on capital i know this may be a better question for the next earnings call but just given what youre seeing today and your higher capital levels do you think youll be in a good position to get a lot more aggressive with the buyback once you close the deal the capital ratios will still be pretty robust at that point so just curious if youre looking to get more aggressive following the close darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i guess i would more aggressive that gives me a little bit of agita but we certainly are will be continue to be active and prudent stewards of capital my first hope is that we go back to the conversation we were having before about loan growth and that we continue to grow customers and grow balances and we use that capital to deploy it for in the sake of our customers that said when you look at the things in front of us with hopefully deploying some of that cash and seeing some releases of provision and get the synergies the cost savings out of the merger were going to be creating more capital and that gives us a great opportunity to go and do buybacks and so well go through and put the two banks together well put our forecast of loan growth together and uses of that capital well consider the dividend and where that is within our capital governance and then what we cant deploy effectively well give it back to you guys and so i think just based on where i sit and where our ratios are right now its safe to say that capital deployment will be in our future david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc would you say that the chances are better than not that you wrap up the buyback that you have out there by ccar next year darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well since we announced the buyback in january and we got approval from the board but we didnt actually use it because we announced the deal david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc right yeah darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 and so i dont think we could use that whole thing up before ccar next year because well be submitting that in april of next year and so between the fourth quarter and the first quarter to be able to use up that whole allotment would be pretty difficult but well go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc i was just thinking through the first half of next year darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp even through the first half that would start to get tough but like i said well be back to you guys with some more detailed thoughts on capital deployment as we get through legal day one and get the two banks put together at least on paper and we can get a look at the balance sheet and confirm the forecast but i think its definitely safe to say as i mentioned before that a rampup in the rate of capital deployment compared to certainly in the last few years is in front of us david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc sounds good maybe just one quick one on expenses you guys addressed this a little bit earlier but just trying to tie this back to the guidance you gave earlier this year for flat to less than up expense growth for the year ex the deal i know you factored in some fee growth into that guidance as well are you still thinking that that guidance works at this point ex the deal or has the revenue performance been better than what you thought at that point darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes i guess i think theres a couple of things some of the revenue performance has been a little bit better and then its more overall bank performance has been better right so when we were contemplating our accruals for incentives at the start of the year we were expecting not as quick a rebound in the economy and maybe a little bit higher chargeoffs than what were actually experiencing and so as we work through the year and we see better performance at the bank we tend to set our accruals as a percentage of the banks net income and as the net income is increasing were accruing a higher amount for incentives and so if you go back to that original guide of flat to ex the peoples and the other things were probably more going to run to ex the peoples deal david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great and one last one on deposits i hear you loud and clear when you say youre expecting deposits to stick around for a while but i was just curious if youve seen any increased spending whether its amongst consumer customers or business customers of deposits in recent months thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah its interesting to see the deposits we are seeing people spending but its not seeing were not its not showing up as a decrease in the balances whats interesting is ive started to get back out again as we reopen the economy and lucky for gerards question i had spent some time with some of our dealers but a couple of mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 our other customers and they had received ppp loans and im going somewhere with this because it was interesting to me that they had just gotten forgiven and i said oh well what are you going to do with them do you have the money left and they said we have every cent still and i said why you got that to pay for these expenses and they said oh we did that out of our normal cash flow we just adjusted our operations we didnt want to spend the money until we actually had the loan forgiven in case we didnt get it forgiven and so that gives you a little bit of an insight into some of the mindset of the type of customers that we have one but two that those dollars are still sitting there and available to be spent and so i think well start to see those move but we need to continue to see movement in the economy and from any of the customers that ive spent time with and talked to theres obviously some supply chain challenges in certain sectors the biggest supply issue is talent and available workers and i think thats the next thing to go is to get more folks back on the employment rules and then well start to see i think some more of that spending and demand for the cash out of both the consumer and the business deposit accounts david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc all right great appreciate all the color thanks operator your next question is from peter winter with wedbush securities peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks hi darren welcome back darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp hi peter thank you peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc just two quick housekeeping questions last quarter rené mentioned that there was about million in swap income and i was just wondering what it was in the second quarter and maybe the outlook for the second half of the year darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah you said you had a couple is that your only question or do you have another one peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc well i just the other on ppp darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc how much is left in terms of amortized fees darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp so in swap income for the quarter it was down about million and as we mentioned i think a couple of calls ago that the total for the year was going to be closer to for close to what it was in but kind of peaking in the fourth quarter last year first quarter of this year and then declining each quarter from there it looks like they will be down kind of round numbers call it million a quarter the rest of the way this was a bigger quarter just because of the nature of some of the swaps that went on and off but no change to that guide and when we look at ppp we look at ppp round one the bulk of the origination fee has now gone through and been captured in the income statement and through net interest income but ppp round two while the forgiveness portals are open we havent really recognized any forgiveness on those yet and so the whole second round of balances and the origination fees associated with them are still hanging out there and round numbers emphasize around maybe million of income to come in and hopefully well start to see it in the next quarter but the good news with it is it either amortizes in every month or it accelerates but you dont lose it and so thats out there and thats also factored into our guide about net interest income being down lowsingle digits yearoveryear peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure thing operator and this does end
