morning everyone as we reflect on the past quarter and the first nine months of the year were pleased with the progress we have made executing on the plans we laid out in january through the first three quarters of the year we have been actively putting our dry powder to work we deployed billion of cash into net investment securities growth investing at consecutively higher yields thereby limiting the impact on accumulated other comprehensive income and at the same time we began to rebuild our derivatives hedging portfolio excluding the impact of the acquired loans and ppp loans weve grown commercial and industrial loans by billion consumer loans by about million while the 28billion decline in cre balances reflects our decision to serve our commercial real estate customer base in a slightly different way all of these efforts have led to a reduction in our asset sensitivity helping to protect our net interest margin from future rate shocks and making our balance sheet more capital efficient in terms of capital we restarted common share repurchases in this years second quarter and have now repurchased billion in common stock representing of outstanding shares and we closed the acquisition of peoples united bank and began the process of integrating this valuable franchise looking back through the first nine months of this year this hard work has translated into strong financial results we generated positive operating leverage and growth in pretax preprovision net revenue and the trend has grown stronger each quarter as we generated pretax preprovision net revenue of more than billion in the third quarter of this year representing positive operating leverage compared to the linked quarter tangible book value per share has also remained relatively stable during despite the rising rate environment and the impact that can have on accumulated other comprehensive income we ended the third quarter with a cet1 ratio of which exceeds the median peer bank level by a wide margin but our work is not done we continue on the path set out at the beginning of this year to build a more capital efficient less assetsensitive balance sheet that will produce predictable revenue and earnings a key element of our plan is to recognize the value created from the combined franchise were excited about our expanded footprint and the benefits that our combined company can bring to our shareholders customers employees and communities now lets review our results for the quarter diluted gaap earnings per common share were for the third quarter of compared with in the second quarter of net income for the quarter was million compared with million in the linked quarter on a gaap basis mts third quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of and an annualized return on average common equity of this compares with rates of and respectively in the previous quarter included in gaap results in both the second and third quarters were aftertax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to million or per common share pretax mergerrelated expenses of million related to the peoples united acquisition were included in these gaap results these mergerrelated charges translate into million aftertax or per common share consistent with our longterm practice mt provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the aftertax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions mts net operating income for the third mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 quarter which excludes intangible amortization and mergerrelated expenses was million compared with million in the linked quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share were for the recent quarter compared with in second quarter net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and in the recent quarter the comparable returns were and in the second quarter of in accordance with the secs guidelines this mornings press release contains a reconciliation of gaap and nongaap results including tangible assets and equity next well look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated these results taxable equivalent net interest income was billion in the third quarter of an increase of million or from the linked quarter the increase was driven largely by approximately million of impact from higher rates on interest earning assets inclusive of the effect of interest rate hedges also an million increase from one additional day in the quarter and a million increase in interest received on nonaccrual loans the net interest margin for the past quarter was up basis points from in the linked quarter the primary driver of the increase to the margin was higher rates which we estimate boosted the margin by basis points in addition the margin benefited from a reduced level of cash held on deposit with the federal reserve which we estimate added basis points all other factors added basis points to the margin next lets discuss the average loan balance trends during the quarter where youll be able to see the progress we continue to make transitioning to a more capitalefficient balance sheet average loans and leases were billion during the third quarter of essentially unchanged with the linked quarter looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the second quarter commercial and industrial loans and leases increased million or to billion with million or growth largely coming from core commercial banking clients and million or growth in average dealer floor plan balances this growth was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in ppp loans excluding ppp loans total average ci loans and leases grew by million or quarteroverquarter ppp loans ended the third quarter at only million and are not expected to have a material impact on loan growth going forward with the peoples united acquisition we have two new business lines that impact our balance sheet growth in average equipment financing continues to be solid growing million or sequentially however this growth was offset by a million or decline in average mortgage warehouse line usage during the third quarter average commercial real estate loans decreased by million or to billion permanent commercial mortgages and construction loans equally contributed to the decrease our construction exposure continues to decline as projects reach completion and the decline in the permanent commercial mortgages is due in part to converting some of these loans into offbalance sheet financing facilitated by our mt realty capital corporation subsidiary residential real estate loans increased million or about to billion due to the continued retention of new originations that we hold on the balance sheet for investment partially offset by normal amortization average consumer loans were up million or about to billion recreational finance loan growth continues to be the main driver of growth these average loans grew by million or that growth was partially offset by a 236million or decline in average auto loans mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 average earning assets excluding interestbearing cash balances which is inclusive of cash on deposit at the federal reserve increased billion or and due largely to the 16billion increase in average investment securities during the quarter we completed various balance sheet restructuring actions to optimize the funding base of the combined bank these actions utilize some of the excess cash available and resulted in a decrease in deposits we expect cash balances to remain relatively stable into the end of this year average interestbearing cash balances decreased by billion to billion during the third quarter of this year due largely to the decline in deposit balances and the cash deployed to purchase investment securities average deposits decreased by billion or compared with the second quarter the decline in deposits reflect the impact of market conditions and planned balance sheet management actions some of these include a 1billion decline in escrow and mortgage warehouse related deposits reflecting lower levels of activity associated with the rising rate environment million reduction in trust demand deposits resulting from lower levels of capital markets activity compared with the second quarter there was a 1billion planned reduction in noncore highcost deposits and a 16billion reduction in municipal average balances as customers pay down lines and shifted to paying off some higheryielding higher balance products billion in commercial mortgages a reduction of billion in commercial balances as customers move to offbalance sheet sweep as well as a reduction in line utilization and billion in lower time deposit balances and other rate sensitive products customer operating account balances have stabilized average noninterestbearing deposit balances declined during the third quarter of this year however these deposit balances grew by million or on an end ofperiod basis turning to noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in the third quarter compared with million in the linked quarter mortgage banking revenues were million in the recent quarter unchanged from the linked quarter revenues from our residential mortgage business were million in the third quarter compared to million in the prior quarter residential mortgage loans originated for sale were million in the recent quarter compared with million in the second quarter both figures reflect our decision to retain a substantial majority of the mortgage originations for investment on our balance sheet commercial mortgage banking revenues were million in the third quarter compared with million in the linked quarter that figure was million in the year ago quarter trust income was million in the recent quarter down from million in the second quarter the decrease was due largely to the impact of lower market valuations on assets under management and assets under administration in addition recall that the second quarter included million in tax preparation fees which did not recur in the recent quarter these declines were partially offset by an incremental million and recapture of money market fee waivers these fee waivers are now fully recaptured service charges on deposit accounts were million compared with million in the second quarter the decline primarily reflects the waiver of service charges in september on acquired customer deposit accounts turning to expenses operating expenses for the third quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and mergerrelated expenses were billion compared to billion in the linked quarter the increase was due largely to higher salary and benefit costs resulting from one additional business day and the investment in talent that and an investment in our talent that affected approximately half of our organization as well as increased incentive accruals tied to improved bank performance mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 we also saw an increase in fdic insurance expense reflecting the impact of acquired loans deemed to be criticized the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization and mergerrelated expenses from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was in the recent quarter compared with in second quarter and in the third quarter of last year next lets turn to credit despite the supply chain disruptions labor shortages and persistent inflation credit remained stable the allowance for credit losses amounted to billion at the end of the third quarter up million from the end of the linked quarter in the third quarter we recorded a 115million provision for credit losses compared to million in the second quarter note that this amount in the second quarter excludes the 242million socalled cecl double count provision related to the nonpurchase credit deteriorated acquired loans net chargeoffs were million in the third quarter compared to million in this years second quarter the reserve build was largely due to changes in economic assumptions included in our reserve methodology as well as growth in our consumer portfolios as forward interest rate curves were adjusted to reflect the rising interest rate environment the baseline macroeconomic forecast experienced a deterioration in the third quarter for those indicators that our reserve methodology is most sensitive to including unemployment rate gdp growth and residential and commercial real estate values nonaccrual loans decreased to billion compared to billion sequentially at the end of the third quarter nonaccrual loans represented of loans outstanding down from at the end of the linked quarter as noted net chargeoffs for the recent quarter amounted to million annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans were basis points for the third quarter compared to basis points in the second quarter loans days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were million at the end of the recent quarter down from million sequentially in total of those 90day past due loans were guaranteed by governmentrelated entities turning to capital mts common equity tier ratio was an estimated compared with at the end of the second quarter the decrease was due largely to the impact of the repurchase of million in common shares which represented of outstanding stock reflecting the common share repurchases tangible common equity totaled billion a decrease of from the end of the prior quarter tangible common equity per share amounted to down or from the end of the second quarter now turning to the outlook with three quarters in the books well focus on the outlook for the fourth quarter relative to this years third quarter first lets take a look at the outlook for the balance sheet we continue to expect to grow the investment securities portfolio by billion in the final quarter of this year keep in mind this cadence could accelerate or slow depending on market conditions and customer loan demand turning to the outlook for average loans we expect average loan and lease balances to be largely in line with the third quarter average of billion we expect growth in average ci residential mortgage and consumer loans and anticipate a slight decline in average cre balances sequentially as we look to the income statement were excited about the continued growth in pretax preprovision revenue in the fourth quarter fourth quarter net interest income is expected to be billion plus or minus million the variability in this guidance reflects the uncertainty of the speed of interest rate hikes by the fed as well as the reactivity of deposit pricing and the deployment of excess liquidity and loan growth mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 turning to our fee businesses we expect fourth quarter fee income to be essentially flat compared to the third quarter we anticipate operating expenses which exclude both mergerrelated costs and intangible amortization we expect them to also be flat from the third quarter we do expect a further realization of merger synergies to be reflected in a decline in the salary benefit line however we expect this decline to be offset by elevated professional services and advertising and promotion costs as we continue to work to integrate both franchises and to introduce mt to our new markets turning to credit we continue to expect credit losses to remain well below mts legacy longterm average of basis points for the fourth quarter we estimate that net chargeoffs for the combined company will be in the basis point range our provision follows the cecl methodology which is heavily dependent upon macroeconomic assumptions any change in our allowance for credit losses would be reflective of any changes in the economic outlook and their assumptions turning to capital we believe the current level of core capital exceeds that needed to safely run the combined company and to support lending in our communities we plan to return excess capital to shareholders at a measured pace mts common equity tier ratio of at september comfortably exceeds the required regulatory minimum threshold which takes into account our stress capital buffer or scb we anticipate ending this year with a cet1 ratio slightly above the range we have been targeting previously with a solid starting cet1 ratio and the potential to generate additional amounts of capital over the next years we do not expect to change our capital distribution plans we anticipate continuing to repurchase common shares at the pace of million per quarter under our current capital plan all right now lets open up the call to questions before which gretchen will briefly review the instructions question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just operator and your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you good morning darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 i guess maybe just darren talk about nii a little bit obviously i think third quarter was a little shy of expectations fourth quarter seems in line as we think about the outlook from onwards how do you see nii growing from there into given your outlook on the balance sheet should we expect a steady lift higher given tailwind from rates and your views any color around indiscernible darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp sure let me kind of take those in sequence for and ill go in reverse order so for well come back in january with the full outlook but obviously where we expect to end the year at about billion we think is a good jumpingoff point for thinking about when we look at the third quarter and where we ended up versus where we might have anticipated the difference is really in the cash balances and as weve been looking forward for weve been talking about deploying that excess cash and managing down some of the highcost funding and it was our objective to get to basically the level that were at at the end of the third quarter at the end of the fourth and so the reason why the fourth quarter expectation is broadly in line with where we were before is because thats the cash level that were at and before we would have expected a little bit more cash on the balance sheet in the third quarter and what i would say is when we look at whats been happening with our client base and i think you see broadly across the industry is the third quarter was really a big inflection point for deposit movement and deposit betas and that we saw a number of balances move into offbalance sheet or money market funds and i think what we see going forward is as we talked a little bit about barclays that we start to see deposit betas move up a little bit and so well still get some benefit from the rising rates it might not be what weve seen in the prior quarters but should still be positive and then as we get into well see where the outlook is but part of what weve been working on is some of the balance sheet restructuring weve talked about to try and help protect those margins and lock them in and you probably start to see the growth in net interest margin slow down and so as we get into well be looking at the combined balance sheet and the various businesses that we have in there it feels like were getting to a point where for the balances that are tied to interest rates and fees that are tied to rates think about the two mortgage fee businesses as well as the mortgage warehouse lending business that were getting towards bottom and that they should be kind of at that level going forward and then well continue to work on building our presence in the new geographies and taking advantage of our new organization and so well get back to or not deposit loan growth levels that look more like our combined firms delivered prepandemic but well come back with more specifics for you in the first in the january call ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc all right thank you and helpful operator the next question comes from betsy graseck from morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to understand how youre thinking about just the capital levels i know you have a significant amount of excess capital but in this environment do you anticipate leaning into loan growth and then maybe you could help us understand how youre going to be funding that loan growth or would you be looking to do the opposite i know you gave us the buyback amount but does it make more sense to buy back more and grow loans less just a little bit of that dynamic and how youre thinking about it would be helpful thanks darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah sure happy to talk about that the way we think about lending and always have at the bank is were number one we only can provide loans that are demanded by our customers we cant create loan demand for them and so were always there for clients in our communities to support their investment needs and as we work through that were always trying to find the right balance between making sure that were providing capital that our clients need with earning a return on the capital that our shareholders have entrusted to us and so we always start with returns we look at those returns not just at each individual loan level but across the whole relationship and that kind of is the governor that dictates the pace at which we grow the combination of what returns look like and what demand there is in the marketplace and so capital is really an outcome from thinking about it that way meaning we will hold capital to be able to support clients and their growth and that which we dont need to support lending well look to return to the shareholder typically through a combination of dividends and buybacks with a little bit of an emphasis on buybacks the only thing that i think is a change that weve started to see this quarter that well all i think be cognizant of is the macroeconomic forecast got a little worse which means the provision is up but provision is capital by another name and so well be thinking about the combination of whats sitting in the allowance and what our capital ratios are to make sure that we feel like the bank is well protected but were here to support growth in our communities and anxious to be that provider of capital and so over a long period of time its kind of what happens with real gdp growth in the communities is generally the growth rate that you see and so thats kind of how we think about it and the tradeoffs that we try to make and well be back as i said with a little more color in january with how we feel about betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right that makes sense to hear how youre thinking about it im just also wondering in this higher rate environment higher inflation environment does that tilt at all the decisioning and part of the question comes from how were fund how youre thinking of funding the loan growth its obviously not just through capital but also through either deposits or wholesale funds etcetera so does that change the dynamic at all thanks darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 no we try to think about both sides of the balance sheet on a matchfunded basis so we think about deposits on kind of what we could sell the math so to speak on a matchfunded basis and lending on the same from the same perspective when we look forward one of the things that i think youre seeing in the industry and youll see with us as it relates to liquidity is starting to put in some longer term funding on the balance sheet from a liquidity perspective and so weve talked about the balance sheet weve had going back for the last probably three or four quarters that we have way more cash than we think is efficient and weve been working to put that to work and keep the deposit cost relatively low which i think has been the case and then as we go forward as we continue building out the balance sheet well have a different mix of cash and securities but part of the funding will definitely be some wholesale funding in there you could see this past quarter we did million at the holding company and that was to replace some holding company financing that came with the peoples merger and then from a liquidity perspective well look to add some other wholesale funding into the balance sheet over the course of the fourth quarter and into in all likelihood betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator the next question comes from ken usdin from jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning darren just a followup on the deposit side you mentioned that were just kind of starting to see that change in beta so i was just wondering if you can just talk about just update us on your thoughts around where betas go to incrementally from here and also any thoughts different in terms of where you expect them to go cumulatively over the cycle darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp sure i guess as i mentioned were expecting to see a little bit of a ramp up in deposit betas we expect it to be led largely in the commercial space as well as in the wealth and institutional space meaning the trust demand deposits those tend to be the most price sensitive and start to become priced off of fed funds and so weve seen some movement there as we look at whats on balance sheet sweep whats offbalance sheet i think well see some more pressure on onbalance sheet sweep as well as just commercial checking pricing which will move up the total cost of interest bearing deposits were not seeing a huge pressure on consumer deposit accounts either dda or now we are starting to move a little bit and see some movement in the cd portfolio and that that you can see has been happening in the marketplace again not just for us but for others and so we expect that in the fourth quarter we start to see an uptick mainly in the interestbearing space and checking driven by those categories that i talked about mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 and were probably looking at deposit betas in the quarter that maybe are to up from where they were in the last quarter which i think will remind you thats in the kind of the range and so theyll pop up to the to range which is still really low on a cumulative basis through the cycle right and we fundamentally believe that the deposit pricing will catch up as the fed slows down and that we should expect cumulative betas through the cycle that look like the last rising rate environment it might take a little while to get there but as we had talked about at barclays that we fundamentally believe that margins will not stay above for a long period of time they might get there for a few quarters but over time obviously the market is efficient and those betas will catch up ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great and that was going to be my followup darren is that prior point you had made at barclays just about your line of sight in terms of how long into next year that you think the margin can continue to go up based on what we see in the forward curve right now can it continue to rise throughout next year darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp i think you probably i think theres been a lot of talk ive been reading the press about peak rates and peaks i think youll see a little bit more into next year but i think it starts to peak in either the first or second quarter and come down a little bit but when you look at what the average is likely to be for versus its going to be up and it probably exits the year at a pretty solid level but it will start to work its way down as we go through and into but compared to where weve been for the last few years and really since the great financial crisis its nice to see some spread back in the business coming off of those zero fed funds that we dealt with for so long ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes absolutely all right thanks a lot darren operator the next question comes from erika najarian from ubs erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question is just going back to the dynamics of the third quarter net interest income you mentioned a smaller balance sheet from some of the rebalancing in deposits but also i think your commercial real estate yields are probably less had a lower beta than investors were expecting mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 could you maybe talk a little bit about how your hedge book had impacted that loan beta in the third quarter how we should expect that hedge book to impact the loan beta in the fourth quarter and how your hedging strategy i believe theres billion in notional thats set to expire at the end of first quarter whats sort of the strategy and replacement from there darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp sure so a bunch of things in there to unpack when we look at the cre loans in particular weve talked a lot in the past that those loans are generally the ones where the cash flow hedges are applied the characteristics of those loans set them up best to get the right accounting treatment for the derivatives and when you look at what has happened in the course of the year weve started to rebuild the hedge book we started in the first and second quarter as we saw excuse me some steepness in the curve and so we started to put on some of those hedges some spot and some forward starting and whats happened is in the shortterm from when we put those original hedges on is rates moved up faster than what those curves at the time were implying and because the rates in the market moved up faster than what was in the forward curves when we put the hedges on theyre actually negative right now and so theyre impacting the margin on those commercial real estate loans in a negative way and if we just look kind of quarteroverquarter the impact of the hedges moved about million where the hedges were a positive in the second quarter and they became a negative in the third and given the pace of increase from the fed that negative probably continues into the fourth quarter as well netnet were happy that the rates are moving up faster because so much of the portfolio is tied to those rates and not hedged and eventually the curve that we locked in when we put the hedges on it will catch up to where the fed is and the negative impact will start to go away but thats kind of really whats going on there with those commercial real estate margins in the portfolio and if you look at the hedging the hedges that are out there we expect the notional amount thats actually in place to decrease as we go into the first quarter the fourth quarter will be down a little bit from around billion to about billion of notional and that will step down to the 10billion range through thats based on what we have today as were watching whats going on in the world with the fed and the forward curves we may well put on some additional spot and forward starting as we go through the fourth quarter and go through next year but based on whats on the books today thats kind of how things look erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it my followup question is sort of a twoparter number one just confirming the received fixed rate on the remaining book is about and the second question is as a followup to ken there was a lot of debate in the marketplace in terms of what you meant about nim peaking at then going back down so wanted to sort of clarify that if i assume that earning assets are flat in the fourth quarter versus third quarter that will get me to a nim of about and to get to billion and so if we think about the forward curve with the implication that the fed stops raising rates in february are you saying to us that i think we all understand that if the fed stops in mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 february then margin will peak in first quarter second quarter and then go down and in that case do we have some nim expansion in the first quarter and then do we get back below by yearend i guess thats what were trying to clarify do we get a handle back in the nim at some point in darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp right so your thought process on the fourth quarter is pretty solid thats kind of in the range of where we expect things to be and so when we look into next year we expect that well given the increases that are being anticipated right now in the fourth quarter and the fact that betas are moving but theyre still not obviously we do expect to see as you pointed out some expansion into the fourth quarter and into early and really i think the question and the thing that weve been trying to point out is that unless you go back to earlier than when fed funds stayed above for a long period of time we havent seen sustainably margin sustainably above and so i guess part of what were trying to communicate is that we shouldnt we dont expect that to be the case at mt and were not trying to set up the bank and our expense base and how we think about the bank and how we think about our capital levels assuming that plus will live forever will it turn we believe it will whats the timing its sometime i think and we think in like i said is it the second quarter third quarter i dont know exactly where it goes some of that will depend on what the funding looks like at the bank how quickly deposit betas move what have you but it probably does start to reach its peak in and start to inch its way down does it go below by the end of the year it could but its going to move back in that direction over the long term probably not until and beyond would be my guess erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator our next question comes from bill carcache from wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc good morning darren i wanted to ask if you could give us an update on your cre exposure any concerns over potential downgrades across your different geographic regions and any color you can give on conversations that youre having with customers particularly on the office side darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah sure so in cre in general weve seen an improvement in our criticized mainly driven by continued improvements in the hotel space as well as retail when we look at retail i think back in early the belief was that there would never be anyone shopping in a store again it would all be online and lo and behold here we are back to the similar mix of online and inperson sales and so as that has happened rents have been paid on a steady basis and so the cash flows for the landlords of retail customers have improved and weve seen improvement in those real estate assets similar experience in hotel there has been a lot of capacity thats come out of the system but overall hotel performance is very strong and we continue to see improvements in that sector mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 the places that weve got our eye on are twofold one is in healthcare and when we look at independent living and assisted living those places are having some challenges with staffing its obviously well documented the challenges in staffing in the industry in general and those in particular and so in the shortterm theyve been doing in discussions with our clients there theyre having to use agencies to help with some of the staffing and so thats increasing the cost in the shortterm which is challenging their debt service coverage but were still looking at the portfolio we feel really good about the ltvs and so were so far not seeing a lot in loss content and we have seen some continuing increases in occupancy rates there so i would describe it as stabilizing some positive trends and some that are a little concerning but overall were feeling okay about that portfolio and office is really the key place where as you point out folks are focused now and were still watching to see whats happening with return to office and the mix of kind of fulltime fulltime remote full time in the office and hybrid situations and so we are seeing leases being renegotiated but not eliminated theres some a little bit of pricing pressure there but when we look at our portfolio in particular we see that much of our exposure really sits in and beyond the percentage of our portfolio that has lease expirations in and is really about of the portfolio and of the portfolio plus would have an expiration date on the leases plus and so were obviously actively engaged with those clients to understand whats going on and understand the likelihood of renewals what the occupancy rates are how stable the rents are per square foot and therefore obviously the debt service coverage and so their ability to cash flow but while weve seen some decrease in asset values in office we havent seen them come down anywhere near where our current ltv sit and so its a portfolio that weve got our eye on i wouldnt call it anything more than the normal lens you would expect where its where some of the challenge has shifted over time and were actively engaged with the clients to make sure that were working with them to keep them in business bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thanks and following up on the sequential increase in the reserve rate due to modestly less optimistic macro forecast can you give a little bit more color on how your baseline compares versus your other scenarios how youre weighting them and where youd expect or where we should expect the reserve rate to sort of settle if unemployment were to go to say the range darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so when we weight the scenarios the baseline is the bulk of the weight we consider a worse economic situation as well as a better one and depending on where we are in the cycle we kind of weight them differently so if things are good the likelihood that they get better we would feel is less and so we put a little bit more weight on the downside the reverse would be true if you look at what happened this quarter and the change this quarter there were two things that drove the oddmillion addition and about onethird of it was just because of the change in mix on our balance sheet and where the growth came from we had a little bit more growth in the consumer portfolios the consumer portfolios tend to be longer dated and so with the cecl methodology the amount that you put aside is more for longer dated assets and so that drove about a third of the increase and then the other twothirds was really just a function of the changes in the macroeconomic assumptions mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 and so just to give you a sense i dont think its linear but the biggest driver was an increase in the unemployment rate in our macroeconomic assumption from to and so basis points added call it million i dont think its linear but if you did that math you kind of go up by times to get to so maybe you add another million or sorry million if it goes that high right and so it also depends on whats the mix of the portfolio right and so theres a bunch of factors to keep in mind thats one of the biggest drivers but youve got gdp in there youve got asset values both for mortgages for consumers as well as for commercial real estate and so theres a number of things at play but obviously the model is sensitive to changes in those factors and unemployment is one of the key ones bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc well its a complex topic but thats very clear very clear explanation thanks appreciate you taking my questions operator the next question comes from gerard cassidy from rbc capital gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi darren darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning gerard how are you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good a couple of questions for you first coming back to your thinking on the net interest margin and you made reference to pre2000 where the fed funds rate was for an extended period of time which kept the margin over if the fed chooses a terminal rate of lets say but stays there well into the middle of lets say so they get there in the spring of they dont touch it for to months can you give us your thoughts after the trickle down from maybe over does the margin then stabilize im not going to put you on the spot and say but the thinking is what im more interested in darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp sure well i feel like youre putting me on the spot gerard but thats okay ive never shied away from being on the spot so to have some margin it helps to have a higher fed funds right because so much of the asset book prices off of libor well not anymore sofr and bsby which is very very highly correlated to fed funds and so once youve got a spread over the reference rate really so from a loan perspective its whats how is competition and whats the spread over the reference rate and so that kind of affects the yield on the asset side and on the deposit side its really twofold one is whats your loantodeposit ratio right and so theres still a lot of liquidity in the system and loantodeposit ratios are low which takes off a little bit of pressure on deposit pricing the other thing thats happened a lot in the last few years particularly in retail banking theres just been a change in how customer pricing works and the mix of fees versus spread mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 and so what i think you see a little bit in the industry is as fees have come down think about maintenance fees think about overdraft fees think about other service fees that have come down and been competed away i think that starts to put a little pressure on how fast and how high rates might go on at least on the now accounts and savings accounts i think time deposits are generally viewed as almost a discretionary asset in the industry our view on it is we need to provide a great checking account experience that its all about transactions and convenience and that core operating account whether its a consumer whether its a small business whether its a commercial customer thats the core of your bank and your funding base and then you make decisions about some of the other interestsensitive products based on that and when youve got that core funding base it gives you the ability to price those other ratesensitive products a little bit differently and we try to make sure that were giving a fair rate to our clients and manage the overall relationship profitability but one of the definite benefits in the margin in general is what the mix of deposits is and that core funding base is a critical element and a big part of mt and so when you look across the industry whats a normalized industry margin its going to matter a lot what your funding mix is and what percentage of core deposit is funded but i guess coming back to the point thats got a lot of attention obviously is that were just in a place where we havent been for a long time in terms of the margin and in terms of fed funds and it seemed like the industry in general was getting a little euphoric that things were just going to keep going up and up and thats just not the case we know that especially folks like us or you gerard whove been around for a long time the sage old veteran that that doesnt happen and competition pressures the margins and things normalize gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc flattery will get you everywhere with me and then second as a followup darren can you give us an update on just how the peoples deal is moving along and if you dont mind can you update us on just the trend line of the onetime charges and then cost savings and then as part of that cost the onetime charges i happened to receive in my mailbox last night since you guys are new to this territory an enticement to open up an account they would pay me i dont know i guess it was but is that an ongoing marketing expense that you talked about or is that part of your onetime charges darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp sure so gerard youre a very special prospect so we only give to our most important prospects gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah okay you caught my sarcasm so a bunch of things in there were progressing along with the integration obviously we completed the system conversion over labor day and have spent september stabilizing things mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 and stabilizing when i say that is really working through with all of the clients to make sure that they have access that they understand how the tools work and that theyre able to perform the basic functions that they look for on a daytoday basis and whenever you go through a massive change like this theres always some things where theres some confusion but overall we feel really good about how things have gone we convert nearly million customers and while there have been some hiccups the complaints have been less than even with that were not happy until everyone has the access that theyre looking for and weve been working with those clients on a one onone basis to solve their individual issues and so from a onetime perspective really when we look at the marketing we would think of marketing expense as a onetime pretty much in the month of the conversion and then beyond that we would think about it as operating expense and so when you look at those cash bonus incentives those become part of marketing expense on an ongoing basis and when we talked about what well do in the fourth quarter obviously well ramp up a little bit what were spending on marketing including some of those promos to introduce ourselves to those folks like you who dont know us as well in the markets and then to our existing clients to hopefully reconfirm their purchase decision to stay with us and as well to entice them to think about other products that mt can provide because we think our product set is very competitive as well as our pricing and so youll see some of that and then the other thing will just be some lingering effects of stabilizing the systems or completing some of the conversions i shouldnt say stabilizing the systems the systems are fine theyve actually worked completely exactly as expected its more stabilizing the expectations of folks and doing some little cleanup that will linger into the fourth quarter but when you look what youll start to see is you will see the impact of the acquisition in the salary and benefit line and so we always have some dislocations at the time we close a deal and then we have dislocation starting after the system conversion and those are typically the conversion date plus days or and so those folks theres no change in those decisions in fact if theres any change some people have elected to stay when they were originally going to be when they were going to separate but overall the expectation of decline is in line with what we thought it would be and that will start to show up in the salary and benefit line in the fourth quarter gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you so much darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp thanks gerard we look forward to you being a customer gerard cassidy q analyst
