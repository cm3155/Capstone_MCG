second quarter results and the performance through the first half of the year we continue to grow loans while also shifting the composition of our loan portfolio and reducing cre customer deposits increased sequentially while total deposit costs have leveled off net interest income and net interest margin both inflected off the first quarters cyclical loan asset quality trends are performing as expected with reductions in nonaccrual and criticized balances and net chargeoffs in line with our fullyear outlook capital continues to build with the cet1 ratio increasing to over we continue to make progress on our capital return considerations and our stress capital buffer decreased basis points to reflecting the strength of our core earnings power and ongoing risk management work now lets look at the specifics for the second quarter diluted gaap earnings per share were for the second quarter improved from in the first quarter net income for the quarter was million compared to million in the linked quarter an increase of mts second quarter results produced an roa and roce of and respectively the cet1 ratio remained strong growing to at the end of the second quarter and tangible book value per share grew included in our gaap results for the recent quarter were pretax expenses of million related to the fdic special assessment this amounts to million aftertax or per share as a reminder results for this years first quarter included million related to the fdic special assessment amounting to million aftertax effect or per share slide includes supplemental reporting of mts results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the aftertax effect of the amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions mts net operating income for the second quarter was million compared to million in the linked quarter diluted net operating earnings per share were for the recent quarter up from in the first quarter net operating income yielded an rota and an rotce of and for the recent quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 next lets look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our second quarter results please turn to slide taxableequivalent net interest income was billion in the second quarter an increase of million or from the linked quarter net interest margin was an increase of basis points from the first quarter the primary drivers for the increase to the margin were a positive basis points from fixed rate asset repricing primarily within the investment and consumer loan portfolios positive basis points from sequentially higher non accrual interest positive basis point from lower interestbearing deposit costs partially offset by a negative basis points from the impact of swaps and a negative basis points from higher borrowing costs and balances the second quarter included nonaccrual interest of million compared to an average of million in the prior five quarters if nonaccrual interest was at the average run rate the second quarter nim would have been in total swaps reduced nim by basis points in the second quarter turn to slide to talk about average loans average loans and leases increased to billion compared to the linked quarter as have been the trend for the last several quarters ci and consumer growth outpaced the decline in cre ci loans grew to billion driven by increases in middle market dealer commercial services mortgage warehouse lending and fund banking the ci growth reflects an increase in line utilization and higher origination activity cre loans declined to billion reflecting continued low originations and elevated paydowns as we continue to manage our cre concentration residential mortgage loans were relatively unchanged at billion consumer loans grew to billion reflecting growth in recreational finance and indirect auto loans loan yields increased basis points to aided by sequentially higher nonaccrual interest and fixed rate loan repricing partially offset by a higher drag on our cash flow hedges turning to slide our liquidity remains strong at the end of the second quarter investment securities and cash including cash held at the fed totaled billion representing of total assets average investment securities increased by billion the yield on the investment securities increased basis points to as the yield on new purchases exceeded the yield on maturing securities during the second quarter we purchased over billion in securities with an average yield of and a duration of years over the remainder of the year we expect an additional billion in security maturities with an average yield of which we intend to reinvest at higher yields the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the quarter was years and the unrealized pretax loss on afs portfolio was only million or basis points drag on cet1 turning to slide we remain focused on growing customer deposits and are pleased with the stabilization of our yields average total deposits declined billion or less than to billion reflecting sequential growth in average customer deposits offset by a billion decline in broker deposits average broker deposits of billion reflects the decision to shrink noncustomer funding sources consumer mortgage business banking and institutional finance had stable to growing average deposits compared to the first quarter while commercial deposits declined average noninterestbearing deposits declined billion to billion with lower commercial and business banking balances as a result of seasonally and continued but moderating disintermediation noninterestbearing deposits were relatively stable for all other business lines excluding broker deposits the noninterestbearing deposit mix in the second quarter was compared to in the first quarter interestbearing deposit costs decreased basis points to while the total deposit cost was unchanged at this reflects more rational pricing in our markets mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 continuing on slide noninterest income was million compared to million in the linked quarter recall that the first quarter included million bayview distribution trust income increased million to million reflecting approximately million in seasonally tax preparation fees typically earned in the second quarter and strong sales performance across our institutional services business second quarter mortgage fees were million compared to million in the first quarter commercial mortgage fees increased million from the linked quarter to million reflecting an uptick in origination activity while residential mortgage fees decreased million to million reflecting lower servicing fees service charges increased million to million from higher consumer debit interchange fees other revenues from operation were unchanged at million with increases in merchant discount credit card letter of credit and other creditrelated fees offsetting the million first quarter blg distribution security losses of million primarily reflect realized losses on the sale of nonagency securities as we derisked our portfolio turning to slide noninterest expenses were billion a decrease of million from the first quarter as is typical for mts first quarter results expenses in the quarter included approximately million of seasonally higher compensation costs salaries and benefits decreased million to million reflecting seasonally elevated expenses in the first quarter offset by the full quarter impact of annual merit increases the second quarter included million related to the fdic special assessment compared to million in the prior quarter other costs of operations decreased million to million from lower supplemental executive retirement costs and lower losses on lease terminations the adjusted efficiency ratio excluding the impact of the fdic special assessment was compared to in the first quarter next lets turn to slide for credit net chargeoffs for the quarter totaled million or basis points down from basis points in the linked quarter the three largest chargeoffs were million combined and represent ci loans that span industries including services manufacturing and retail the cre chargeoffs including chargeoffs within the office portfolio remain at manageable levels through the first half of the year nonaccrual loans decreased million to billion the nonaccrual ratio decreased basis points to driven largely by a decrease in cre reflecting favorable resolutions with borrowers including payoffs and paydowns in the second quarter we recorded a provision of million compared to net chargeoffs of million the allowancetoloan ratio increased basis point to the provision for credit losses decreased million compared to the first quarter reflecting lower cre loans including criticized loans and modest improvement in forecasted real estate prices partially offset by growth in ci and consumer portfolios please turn to slide when we file our form 10q in a few weeks we estimate that the level of criticized loans will be billion compared to billion at the end of march the improvement for the linked quarter was largely driven by million decrease in cre criticized loans slide provides additional detail on ci criticized balances total ci criticized balances increased million the majority of the increase is concentrated within vehicle and recreational finance dealers and healthcare sectors offset by declines in most other industries we saw additional migration to criticized within nonauto dealer portfolio continuation from trends we discussed in the first quarter however there has been limited incremental migration within the portfolio since early in the second quarter turning to slide includes a detail on cre criticized balances total cre criticized balances decreased million from the last quarter upgrades and payoffs of criticized loans outpaced downgrades into criticized the decline was across multifamily retail health services hotel and construction but we did see modest increases in office and industrial the decrease reflects the effects to work with borrowers to find favorable resolutions we are actively working through our criticized population for favorable outcomes mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 turning to slide for capital mt cet1 ratio at the end of the second quarter was an estimated compared to at the end of the first quarter the increase was due in part to the continued pause in repurchasing shares and strong capital generation at the end of the second quarter the negative aoci impact on the cet1 ratio from afs securities and pension related components would be approximately basis points now turning to slide sic slide for outlook the economy is slowing a bit but remains in good health job growth wage growth and spending have slowed to more sustainable levels we see the socalled soft landing scenario as having the highest probability but the possibility remains for a mild recession brought on by the lag impact of rate hikes consumer spending has slowed to a pace consistent with job and wage growth alleviating inflation pressure for many goods and services the labor market remains positive but is clearly slowed in turn keeping a lid on wage pressure and leading to longer spells of unemployment we expect that to continue for the rest of inflation figures remain above the feds target of chiefly because of rents and home prices we expect the weaknesses seen in rent listings to play through the official inflation data helping bring the headline inflation figures down inflation in the second quarter slowed an encouraging development after higher readings in the first quarter shifting to outlook we expect net interest income to be billion to billion our outlook incorporates the latest forward curve that has one rate cut in september and another in december however we expect the level of rates to have a limited direct effect on net interest income outlook as we have taken steps to reduce our asset sensitivity and are now more neutral higher for longer rates in the first half of the year allowed us to take additional actions to protect nii from lower interest rate environment for example in the first half of the year we shifted billion of cash into securities and added billion in forward starting cash flow hedges which became active in during or further we expect that the downside in interestbearing deposit beta will be approximately to in the first couple of rate cuts for the remainder of the year mts balance sheet will be smaller with total average assets closer to billion we expect average cash to be approximately billion and securities to be billion with modest growth in loans and deposits our outlook for fees and expenses is unchanged with fees excluding any security gains or losses of billion to billion and expenses excluding the amounts related to the fdic special assessment are expected to be billion to billion we continue to expect chargeoffs for the full year to be near basis points the allowance level will be dependent on many factors including changes in the macroeconomic outlook portfolio mix and underlying asset quality our outlook for the tax rate is to excluding the discrete tax benefit in the first quarter preferred dividends are expected to be approximately million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter reflecting our series j issuance in may and the upcoming series e redemption in august finally as it relates to capital last quarter we laid out five factors for consideration as we assessed our capital return plans for the rest of the year the macroeconomic environment remains healthy mt continues to generate significant capital of the bank growing tangible common equity by over million in the second quarter we continue to manage our cre concentration with cre as a percent of tier capital and allowance of as of the end of the second quarter asset quality continues to improve with declines in nonaccrual and criticized mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 loans and net chargeoffs in line with expectations we laid out in the first quarter mts preliminary stress capital buffer declined basis points to reflecting many of the factors just mentioned given the improvements in these factors we plan to begin our share repurchase in the third quarter at a pace of million per quarter through the end of the year we expect to maintain our capital ratios at least at the current levels for the remainder of the year we will continue to monitor the previouslydiscussed factors as well as the revised basel iii proposal once made public and well adjust our capital return plans if necessary our capital will also be used to support organic growth and grow new customer relationships our strong balance sheet will continue to differentiate us with our clients communities regulators investors and rating agencies to conclude on slide our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis mt has always been a purpose driven organization with a successful business model that benefits all stakeholders including shareholders we have a long track record of credit outperforming through all economic cycles while growing within the markets we serve we remain focused on shareholder returns and consistent dividend growth finally we are a disciplined acquirer and prudent steward of shareholder capital now lets open up for questions before which ashley will briefly review the instructions question and answer section operator certainly operator instructions well take our first question from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so i wanted to ask on nii so you beat on nii this quarter and then your new guide for nii implies that quarterly nii will be relatively flat from levels and you did see a noticeable increase quarteronquarter this quarter in nii so can you just unpack the drivers in the backhalf is there some conservatism baked in there or is there some timing difference in being neutral to rates but maybe perhaps being a little bit more asset sensitive with the first rate cuts if you can just unpack those drivers there daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 yeah no thanks manan our position from rate sensitivity is really quite neutral its based on assumptions but i feel we are really neutral there if you look on the slide deck where we had net interest income in one of the bullets there we highlight that we had a basis point positive impact on nonaccrual interest so let me explain that to you so when our loans go into nonaccrual we basically when we still receive payments both principal and interest all that goes to principal and then if the loan is basically resolved favorably and they pay us off obviously we pay off the principal balance and then anything left over goes into net interest income so what we saw in the second quarter was basically a large amount of loans that basically came out favorably out of our nonaccrual portfolio so what we put on there and what i talked about in the prepared remarks is that if you look at our average nonaccrual interest for the last five quarters its been running around million this quarter we got double that so i would basically say our nim this quarter was actually on track because if you adjust the million out we were at nim and i said that we would be mid3 for the second quarter so were really on path to what i said mid3 second quarter then high3 for third and fourth quarter is really where we wanted to be and expect to be so i think were just on track manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and just to confirm that basis points is where you are above normal right the basis points isnt the total impact daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp its basis points is what i would say would be normal to the run rate yeah so manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc and daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc and you are basis points above that daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp no no no we were basis points so we were we said wed be in the mid3 i say we really came in at if you back out the extra above nonaccrual interest that we normally get i mean were going to get nonaccrual interest every quarter weve been averaging a couple of basis points benefit every quarter because of that thats going to continue for a long time mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it all right perfect and then maybe you can put this in the category of no good deed goes unpunished but on the buyback resumption your message in the deck is that capital levels should at least stay at current levels of around just given that the scb went lower given the excess capital position what do you need to see before you accelerate the pace of buybacks and bring that capital ratio lower daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i think its pretty simple i think we are aggressively working down our asset quality our criticized loans nonperforming assets i think we need to continue to make progress on that as we make progress on that you could see us decide to increase our repurchase shares potentially obviously the economy is a factor in my prepared remarks we said we dont think its likely but its possible that maybe you go into recession so if that were to happen i think wed have to view that and just be a little bit more defensive if that made sense or not and i still want to see the impacts of basel iii i know we are hearing more favorable things but until we actually see it in writing you really dont know whats going on but those are probably the primary things that were working on we continue to shrink our cre concentration make great progress there i have no doubt we will continue to make great progress in the next couple quarters as well there manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator thank you well take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i was hoping you could elaborate on good morning the big drop in the commercial real estate on a periodend basis i think its down about obviously great job bringing that down and i know you touched on some of the kind of opportunities to offload that but its just a bigger drop than i would have thought and i didnt know if there was any reclass into ci as you kind of improved some of those like guarantees and things like that so just elaborate on all that in terms of how youre able to bring it down so much thank you daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah no happy to answer that matt so we are very focused and working really hard both the first line and second line of working hard and made tremendous progress in bringing our cre concentration numbers down mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 we did see a lot more liquidity in the marketplace this quarter and we were able to see some of our clients that we had actually in criticized multifamily be able to do government placements out into the marketplace for liquidity so as we continue to have that liquidity that helps us basically cure some of our criticized loan balances the other thing that i would tell you is that we are doing a finance transformation finance transformation is basically putting in a new general ledger system subledgers which we are doing really well and were about halfway through that process now but its also improving and changing processes so as we improve and change processes we are putting in better controls and more ways of actually how we put loans on the books and that is causing some grading to go from what cre would be into ci owneroccupied because it really comes down to the source of repayment source of repayment is from an operating entity its basically not a cre loan it is a ci owneroccupied loan matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay that makes sense i think thats how others do that too and then just separately on the all other income line you pointed to a couple of kind of positives there is that at a sustainable level or i know it should be lumpy but how do you think about that all other fees of like million thanks daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp it is at a relatively high level id probably trim maybe or out of that potentially on a run rate but a lot of that other revenue that we talked about is the merchant fees and we had good quarter there more activity that could continue as we continue to have activity the other is on loan demand and were having loan syndication fees and all that and thats going to be lumpy we had a good quarter this past quarter in that area we are seeing maybe a little bit of softening in some of the commercial areas so might be a little light but yeah id say at that same level to maybe down or matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you so much daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp sure operator thank you we will take our next question from erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes hi two followup questions please daryl company clearly did a great job in terms of interestbearing deposit costs coming down i know some of that is a mix of broker being actively taken down in terms of exposure could you give us a sense before the rate cuts and we appreciate the downside beta guide that you gave us but if we dont rate cut how do you feel like this level of progress is sustainable and maybe break it down in terms of what youre observing with customer deposit rates versus the continued runoff in brokerage cds mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so brokerage cds will continue to run off we have another big chunk coming off in third and fourth quarter so well be pretty much out of broker deposit cds at least by the end of the year as far as the betas go and rates we continue to just see more rational pricing in the marketplace and were able to maybe offer specials but the specials that were offering just arent as high as what they were before so youre still seeing that there is still some disintermediation it is slowing down but theres still continued disintermediation the one that impacts nii the most is obviously the one that goes to dda to interestbearing deposit balances were capturing any disintermediation but its still seeing a little bit in the commercial area the other thing is on the retail side as long as rates are at this level youre going to see a little bit of attraction of money going out of the nonmaturity bucket into the cd deposits but we feel pretty good that our deposit costs are flat and maybe down as the year progresses and into next year i think its just more rational pricing in the marketplace right now erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you and my second question is a followup to manan so last quarter and during the quarter i think you guys are telling us oh dont back into this cet1 when thinking about buybacks listen to what were saying on the total amount of what were buying back and then of course you had a pretty strong progress in terms of cet1 this quarter and the floor went up even more and i appreciate your response to manans question and i know thats part of the conservatism of this company and why longonlys value you guys so highly i guess im wondering how should we think about the future i get that theres still uncertainty theres still a desire to take down cre concentration a desire to see the economy play out but at this level of earnings power with million youre going to continue to build capital especially if the ci loan growth is engulfed by cre declines so i guess as your longterm shareholders think about forget buybacks for a second returns and what that appropriate capital floor is how would you help them frame that daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah from a floor perspective obviously we are much higher than where we have to run the company longterm for mt we do have elevated credit side loan balances and were really working hard our teams are working their butts off to basically bring those balances down and we hope and plan that to continue through the rest of this year into next year so that is definitely one of the key things that were looking at we are conservative what ive said in prior quarters the capital is not going anywhere erika we will return it we promise you that we arent going to be wasted or do anything stupid about it it will come back to the shareholders at some point down there were just going to do it in a very conservative manner because thats just who we are erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc so i guess to compare it to like how ph jamie says it i guess the better way for your shareholders to think about it is earnings in store daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i also agree to that mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc all right thanks guys operator thank you well take our next question from john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the back to cre i know you mentioned the ongoing focus to reduce the concentration of cre where do you see the cre the riskbased capital percentage going i believe in the past youve indicated you wanted to see it into the range so when wed get that update and then separately in terms of the improvement that you saw in credit this quarter in terms of the past due declines nonaccruals and the credit size can you just talk about what specifically you saw that is driving that and broadly those trends can continue in that direction thanks daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah sure so weve made tremendous progress over the last threeplus years on getting our cre concentration down the plans that we put into place at that point and continue to execute and you saw the benefits in our stress capital buffer because of that and that will hopefully continue when we continue to submit the stress capital ccar test i would say were getting close john we are at now i think were in the neighborhood of being close to where cre will be much more normal space for us were at a level that what we think makes sense for the size company we are and serving our communities and clients so were probably maybe a quarter or two away but i think thats not too far off as far as nonaccruals go id tell you this quarter everything kind of worked came together really strong our first line credit team was working with our clients we have a process in place where were looking at all the cre loans that are maturing and trying to see where and how we can work with our clients to either get it rightsized to get it upgraded off or criticized we are seeing some of our criticized loans getting refinanced by others in the industry and i talked earlier that were seeing some of our criticized loans getting placed in the agencies with our programs with the gses so were basically really focused on that the teams are diligent and working hard and we plan to have those numbers continue to drive down and be really positive mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks daryl that helps and then related to that maybe could you just talk about the role that loan modifications have played here as youve addressed commercial real estate maybe help us with the trajectory of your financial difficulty modifications so they continue to rise and maybe if you could just talk about the concerns out there that theyre simply kicking the can down the road and a year from now we can see these pressures rear their ugly head again daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so when you look at loan modifications when we are working with our clients loan modifications we are asking for more type of recourse or capital to be put into the transactions for them to get more time to work through the higher interest rates that we have so the modifications we are doing are actually enhancing our position so were giving them more extension on time and theyre giving us more capital liquidity recourse for that time so were actually in a better spot so yes our modifications are going up this is like history of mt we work with our clients if our clients support us were going to support them thats what we do and thats what were going to continue to do john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah operator thank you well take our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey daryl good morning daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i just wanted to go back to the criticized ci and cre so a lot of decision making on capital revolves around how some of this plays out if you dont mind give us a sense of if we think about criticized loans if rates go lower i think you mentioned soft landing base case probability most likely for you is there a point in time if rates are lower you get the financials maybe in march of next year we could see a meaningful reset lower from this mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 billion going down by a couple billion like im just wondering could there be a step function decline in criticized loans at some point in the first half of next year based on rates and macro clarity daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so ebrahim thats a great question we saw a short window in the fourth quarter in december when the tenure dropped or a little bit under that and we had huge volume that we were able to place our clients out with the agencies our rcc business was able to place a lot of loans out because of that so i think our tenure last time i looked was ph so i think were getting closer to more of a pivot point where more volume were actually happened so i think lower rates would definitely help us lower our criticized balances sooner and faster from that perspective that would be even more liquidity in the marketplace than what we saw this past quarter ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and i guess the other question on theory given all the work youve done over the past year stress testing et cetera on the cre books just give us your perspective on the loss content in these loans as they maybe some of these go into nonaccrual based on what you know today whats already been deserved and as we think about like chargeoffs relative to the bps that youve guided for this year daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah we have a longterm history of our great strong credit performance so if you look at our ltvs that we have for the cre portfolio even office were still under ltv there so a great thing to look at if you look at our nonaccruals half of our nonaccruals dont have a reserve against it and typically youd have a specific reserve on nonaccruals thats because we have collateral value thats stronger than what the loan value is today so its really the strength of how we underwrite and that credit performance is really what shows through in times of stress so yes we have a higher level of criticized and nonaccrual were working those down but we think the loss content is still a lot lower ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thats great color thanks daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp thank you operator thank you well take our next question from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning hey daryl you had a great amount of securities repricing this quarter up basis points on a bigger book and i can imagine some of that was just a switch from cash but i think you had talked about to basis points going forward so maybe can you just give us a little back color on what drove that basis mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 points and then how youre looking at what securities yields could look like from an incremental perspective going forward thanks daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes so we are being very disciplined in how were approaching our security purchases were trying to keep our durations relatively short we really dont want to have a negatively convex portfolio so when we gotomarket when we buy securities we are basically balancing our securities between positively convex securities like treasuries and cmbs agency securities coupled with some negative convex securities which could be some agency cmos or mbs so were being very balanced from there so were trying to keep our duration around three years because of that our yields if you look at where rates are today are blended to be around the negatively convexed are over the positively convexed are under approximately and were living in three year type duration type instruments overall is kind of what were focused on that said though were still going to have a nice benefit if you look at whats maturing in the third and fourth quarter the average yield of whats maturing is about so were depending on where rates go but right now where we get basis point still increase in that yield portfolio as that churns and turns over so i think we feel really good were just being very disciplined im not good at timing right so we kind of do dollars averaging over time weve done that now for the last year were going to continue to do that going forward and well just do it over time and average in and hopefully continue to average up higher ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then obviously for a long time mt has had a really healthy amount of cash and i think cash and earning assets together is about cash is like 30something percent still low percent and do you still anticipate given that conservatism keeping cash and securities at over as you look forward and what would change that if anything daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so on the prepared call notes what i mentioned is that right now our investment portfolio is about billion we believe that the cash at the fed is closer to mid20 billion so closer to billion were basically just trying to get out of some wholesale funding and just shrinking the balance sheet a little bit so our balance sheet size is coming down as well so i have a smaller balance sheet shouldnt really impact nii just because of the cost of the borrowings and what we earned on the fed balance kind of canceled each other out but we just feel mid25 billion is good we do have limits in place to how low we would go that be in the midtohighteens so we have well above that buffer that were operating right now but just want to be here again conservative if we could go into a recession which we dont think will happen but if we do this will be really conservative balance sheet ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks daryl operator thank you well take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc daryl you obviously did a good job with the dfast and the stress capital buffer coming down i guess a couple questions first is when you look at the improvement and you touched on it what youve obviously done do you think that improvement can be as large next year as you guys continue to reduce these risks to mt as we look out into daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so our plans right now gerard we were really pleased that we were down basis points in our peer group we were one of three banks that had a lower scb so we were really excited to have that outcome but by us really focusing on and pushing down our criticized besides share repurchase maybe increasing its also going to help us in our stress capital buffer where we go through the stress test so were really focused in trying to bring down our criticized levels to as much as we can working with our clients over the next couple quarters so that when we do ccar next year if we decide to do it which we may or may not probably will though well continue to try to get a lower stress capital buffer gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc you got it and then when you look at mts history obviously the organic growth has always been complemented very successfully with acquisitions and when you look out over the landscape over the next to months can you give us your views on depository acquisitions not to say that youre going to do anything nearterm but just how are you guys thinking about depository acquisitions yeah i know theres changes and weve got a presidential election coming up which could influence as well but what have you guys been thinking in that strategy daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so mt has a longterm history of doing acquisitions successful acquisitions and that is one of the reasons how we grow here but to be honest with you we havent really been talking about acquisitions were working on our four priorities that we have in the company right now our four priorities that we have are basically building out our markets in from the peoples acquisition in new england and long island i think thats really important continue to build out because thats a great opportunity for us and we think the mt bank will be really good in the markets that we serve there i think just that they need a bank like us in those markets and we want to deliver to those clients were enhancing our risk areas throughout the company making great progress in those areas we will continue to focus on that were also improving resiliency some of the transformations that were doing were putting in data centers putting things up into the cyber or applications into the cloud so all that is going forward mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 and then lastly were continuing to optimize revenue and expenses we put some money into treasury management this past year and were now growing our treasury management revenues at doubledigit paces right now so we are doing really good and continue to gain more momentum there in that treasury management as we push more into ci thats a huge growth opportunity for us and thats really what were focused on in trying to grow and serve our clients gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator thank you well take our next question from chris spahr with wells fargo please go ahead christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning so my question is just a little bit on expenses the something about head counts what youre thinking about it going forward since sellers expenses were up yearoveryear which seems pretty good overall daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i mean we were right on track from our expense guidelines actually were doing a little bit better than what was in plan so you might see a little bit of shift in that in the second half of the year but were right on track were going to hit our planned numbers on expenses i have no doubt about that ftes we are down a couple hundred million in ftes from the start of the year so thats just being managed by all the leaders in their groups and all that so i think from an expense perspective we really have an owners mindset at mt we really take to heart how we spend money and make sure how were spending money in the right places and getting the right outcomes from that so im really fortunate to have a really great company that really understands how to run a company both from a revenue and expense side basis so its all really good christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just to clarify down a couple hundred not a couple hundred million correct daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp no no no couple hundred ftes yeah ftes christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah okay all right daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp sorry sorry mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then no worries and then just on the outside data processing a big delta and how much is that related to this upgrade that youve been talking about and will some of that run off or are you kind of now at a higher operating plateau on tech expense daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp i would say second half of the year you might see elevations in outside data processing and professional services as we have now seven projects in our investment council are ramped up those probably will be areas of increase well still come in to our target that we set on expenses so i feel really good about that some of the projects are just larger and takes time to ramp up but as we get into youll see some projects start to complete and whether we reinvest in other areas or not well talk to you at that time right now but overall the company is making tremendous progresses on many fronts and we got a lot of momentum going and were going to continue to press on that christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc right thank
