slide our employees and products continue to receive awards from consumer business and trade organizations turn to slide which shows the results of the third quarter as noted in this mornings press release we released our third quarter results as we continue to make progress on the plans we laid out in january there are several successes to highlight net interest margin and net interest income grew sequentially as we continue to grow loans while reducing our cre concentration in fact since the fourth quarter of we have grown average loans by nearly billion while reducing cre by over billion and growing ci and consumer loans funding cost was well managed in this quarter with a 4basispoint decline in the cost of interestbearing liabilities we restarted our share repurchase program in the third quarter and executed million in share repurchases and grew our cet1 ratio to over noninterest income reached a high point in the third quarter if you exclude the prior gains on our two divestitures this was achieved by even considering the foregone fee income from those two sold businesses demonstrating the resiliency and strength of our diversified business model asset quality continued to improve this quarter with reduction in both nonaccrual balances and commercial criticized loans and net chargeoffs below the fullyear outlook now lets look at the specifics for the third quarter diluted gaap earnings per share were for the third quarter improved from in the second quarter net income for the quarter was million compared to million in the linked quarter an increase of

rota and rotce of and for the recent quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 next lets look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our third quarter results please turn to slide taxableequivalent net interest income was billion an increase of million or from the linked quarter the net interest margin was an increase of basis points from the second quarter the primary drivers of the increase to the margin were a positive basis points from fixed asset repricing mostly in the investment portfolio and consumer loans positive basis points from earning asset mix positive basis points from deposit and wholesale funding mix and costs partially offset by a negative basis points from lower nonaccrual interest and a negative basis point for all other items nonaccrual interest amounted to million compared to million in the second quarter turn to slide to talk about average loans average loans and leases increased slightly to billion similar to the trend that we saw last several quarters ci growth outpaced decline in cre ci loans grew to billion driven by increases in fund banking dealer commercial services mortgage warehouse and franchise lending middlemarket utilization declined modestly while dealer floor plan utilization increased from the second quarter as a result of slower auto sales and new model arrivals cre loans declined to billion reflecting continued low originations and paydowns as we continue to manage our cre concentration cre as a percent of tier capital and allowance is estimated to be at the end of the third quarter residential mortgage loans were relatively unchanged at billion consumer loans grew to billion reflecting growth in recreational finance and indirect auto loans loan yields were unchanged at as lower nonaccrual interest was largely offset by the benefit of fixed rate loan repricing and mix shift turning to slide our liquidity remains strong at the end of the third quarter investment securities and cash including cash held at the fed totaled billion representing of total assets the average investment securities increased billion the yield on securities increased basis points to as the yield on new purchases exceeded the yield on maturing securities in the fourth quarter we have billion in securities maturing at an average yield of which we intend to reinvest the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the quarter was years and the unrealized pretax gain on the availableforsale portfolio was million or basis points cet1 benefit if included in regulatory capital turning to slide we remain focused on growing customer deposits and are pleased with the overall deposit performance average total loans declined billion or to billion reflecting a billion decline in broker deposits and a billion decline in nonbroker deposits commercial and business banking grew total average deposits from the second quarter while consumer deposits declined sequentially as we continue to manage more ratesensitive deposits average noninterestbearing deposits declined billion to billion from an expected dealrelated decline in trust demand deposits and modest continued disintermediation within commercial and consumer excluding broker deposits average noninterestbearing deposit mix in the third quarter was interestbearing deposit costs decreased basis points to continuing on slide noninterest income was million compared to million in the linked quarter trust income was million unchanged from the prior quarter with second quarter seasonal tax prep fees of million offset by strong equity market performance and sales performance at ics mortgage fees were million compared to million in the second quarter commercial mortgage fees increased million from the linked quarter to million reflecting an uptick in the origination activity service charges increased million to million from both consumer and commercial mostly related to the number of processing days in the quarter other revenues from operations were unchanged at million mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 turning to slide noninterest expenses were billion an increase of million from the second quarter salary and benefits increased million to million reflecting one additional working day deposit insurance decreased million reflecting the prior quarter million incremental special assessment other costs from operations increased million to million driven mostly by mts obligation under various agreements to share in losses stemming from certain litigation of visa efficiency ratio of was largely unchanged from the second quarter lets turn to slide for credit net chargeoffs for the quarter were million or basis points down from basis points in the linked quarter the three largest chargeoffs in the quarter totaled million combined with and represented two ci loans and one office cre loan nonaccrual loans decreased million or to billion the nonaccrual ratio decreased basis points to driven largely by a decrease in cre nonaccruals from upgrades out of nonaccrual as well as several large payoffs and paydowns in the third quarter we recorded a provision of million compared to a net chargeoff of million the allowancetoloan ratio decreased basis point to as a result of continued improvements in asset quality and improvements in the macroeconomic outlook partially offset by growth in certain portfolios please turn to slide when we file our form 10q in a few weeks we estimate that the level of criticized loans will be at billion compared to billion at the end of june the improvement from the linked quarter was driven by a million decline in ci and million decline in cre criticized balances slide provides additional detail on the ci criticized balances the largest ci criticized balance decreases were within the motor vehicle and recreational finance dealers and manufacturing segments with smaller changes across most other industries the decline within the motor vehicle and recreational finance dealers mostly reflects improvements in debt service coverage ratios and normalizing profit margins within the rv segment slide includes the detail on cre criticized balances the largest cre criticized declines were within healthcare and construction with continued but more modest declines in most other property types except for office within healthcare we saw an uptick in repayment activity as improvements in occupancy and rent growth combined with declining longterm rates allowed for more viable takeouts a decline in construction criticized was aided by improved project performance and loan modifications and curtailments as borrowers continue to support these projects the largest factor that drove audio gap versus prior quarters was the amount of upgrades that occurred in the quarter turning to slide for capital mts cet1 ratio at the end of the third quarter was an estimated compared to at the end of the second quarter the increase was due to continued strong earnings and strong and a million share repurchase in the third quarter at the end of the third quarter the negative aoci impact on the cet1 ratio from availableforsale securities and pensionrelated components combined would be approximately basis points now turning to slide for the outlook lets begin with the economic backdrop the economy remains resilient in the third quarter with gdp growth expected to come in stronger than we had projected the labor market has slowed but remains healthy though we see a soft landing scenario as having the highest probability the possibility remains for a mild recession brought on by lagged impact and rate hikes the consumer spending has slowed alleviating inflation pressure for many goods and services recently inflation has nearly returned to the feds target of mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 now turning to the outlook our outlook for the fullyear nii is unchanged from our last update while the outlook from the fullyear fees expenses and net chargeoffs is unchanged from the ranges we initially discussed in january and maintained through the year that said with three quarters complete we will focus on the outlook for the fourth quarter we expect taxableequivalent nii to be at least billion implying a fullyear nii near the top end of the range we provided previously net interest margin is expected to be in the low our outlook incorporates the latest forward curve that has an additional basis points in rate cuts by the end of the year we expect continued loan growth and average total loans of approximately billion with growth in ci and consumer and lower cre balances total deposits are expected to be at least billion as we continue to focus on growing core customer deposits we expect interestbearing deposit beta of approximately for the first couple of interest rate cuts security balances are expected to continue to grow in the fourth quarter our outlook for the fourth quarter noninterest income is about million reflecting continued strength in mortgage and trust partially offset by other fee categories fourth quarter expenses including intangible amortization are expected to be about billion due to the timing of projects coming online this reflects continued investment in our key priorities and initiatives are closely managing our expenses we continue to expect net chargeoffs for the full year to be near basis points our outlook for the tax rate for the fourth quarter is about sic to and the preferred dividends are expected to be approximately million we plan to continue the million share repurchase in the fourth quarter to conclude on slide our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis mt has always been a purpose driven organization with successful business model that benefits all stakeholders including shareholders we have a long track record of credit outperforming through all economic cycles while growing within the markets we serve we remain focused on shareholder returns and consistent dividend growth finally we are a disciplined acquirer and prudent steward of shareholder capital now lets open the call to questions before which our operator will briefly review instructions mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions our first question will come from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi daryl how are you daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp good how are you doing gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good thank you daryl over the years mt has done a great job in managing their capital and returning excess capital to shareholders youre pointing out today that your cet1 ratio is a very strong and you have the buyback going on again in the fourth quarter can you share with us whether you think the cet1 ratio is at an optimal level and to get there could you increase the share repurchases as you go forward into and once we also get the final basel iii endgame so you guys know what to expect daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah thanks gerard first i just want to start with that we have a lot of flexibility when it comes to capital with a cet1 ratio of and we had really no negative impact on the aoci and we have strong capital generation that said as we continue to move forward into the end of the fourth quarter and into we will continue to look at the economy economy continues to grow now but ph if were starting to slow down that could impact potential increases to share repurchase weve made great progress on our criticized loans theyve come down now two consecutive quarters we expect fourth quarter to be also a really strong decrease in criticized and we believe were at the point now that our cre exposure is where we want it to be and we are now the pipeline is starting to build from that perspective so i believe in well return more capital to shareholders as long as it plays out as mentioned what i just talked about we will probably switch the dollar amounts and target more of a cet1 ratio so for example we might say well buy back in if we want to stay above cet1 ratio and do repurchases and that depends on how much loan growth and rwa growth that we have on the balance sheet i know is higher than what you would need long term but were working on our longterm targets and probably well have something to say about that in the next quarter or so gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good very helpful and then as a followup and im not asking for guidance because i know that wont come until possibly january but it looks like your net interest income has troughed it looks like the first quarter based upon slide that net interest income bottomed and youre gradually growing out net interest income and the margins obviously expanding if the forward curve is correct and if the fed and i know these are big ifs but if mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 the forward curve is correct and the fed is correct then that is going to lower the fed funds rate possibly to to by the end of next year and wed get a positive slope in the curve can you kind of frame out should this growth that youre seeing continue and possibly accelerate in just based aside from growing your balance sheet but just based on interest rates daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah you start off with a very rosy scenario let me just say that our team has worked really hard this past year in and we are really neutral on net interest income and really happy that happened just as the fed started lowering rate so we were very fortunate for that if you look at whats going on we have really good rollon and rolloff rates in a lot of our fixed asset portfolios i know its hard for you as analysts to really understand and get those numbers into your models but if you look at auto and rv resi mortgage and our investment portfolio all those continue to reprice positively this quarter we expect that to continue next quarter and into so thats a positive for us upward sloping curve would enhance that potentially yeah on the deposit side i just see its the strength of our company gerard it is our strong foundation that we have we have really strong stable core operating deposits were seeing now an initial downward beta of thats at the higher end of the range that we talked about previously so thats strong and when you look at hedging we know we already have locked in hedges improvements in our swap book that were going to basically reprice our hedges if you look at the cash flow hedges pointtopoint they should go up about basis points and the fair value hedges should go up about basis points pointtopoint in thats if rates dont even change so thats probably very positive from there so we have a lot of good things going on plus were growing loans even when we were shrinking cre we were able to eke out loan growth so our businesses are performing really well both on the cre and ci side as well as our consumer businesses so i would say we have positive mix benefit as we move forward as we continue to grow that so that gives me a lot of confidence that nii net interest margin should continue to improve gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good very helpful thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp thank you operator thank you our next question will come from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning daryl daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just question on you mentioned the criticized loans decline just wondering do we need rates to go much lower for cre criticized loans to come down over the coming quarters and could we see a big like stairstep decline at some point early next year when you i dont know get updated appraisals financials from these borrowers and what are the implications does it really change your thought process as a result on the cet1 or where the reserve ratio is today at daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah thanks for the question ebrahim what i would tell you is this quarter i pointed out in the prepared remarks the biggest difference in the third quarter versus the past several quarters is that we actually had a lot of upgrades in our roles when rates fall we can have more takeouts and paydowns from that and thats occurring obviously with rates coming down but were getting actually good upgrades now if you look specifically in our healthcare sector that we had the operations really started to improve their occupancy and rents were more positive and they were cash flowing better and thats really positive you have to remember that in our criticized book that we have in total is paying in current so thats really really good if you look at our cre construction book that also dropped a fair amount and that was really driven by interest rates and also just stabilization that youre seeing in the marketplace the projects that we have one of the strengths mt has with all of our lending is really that the clients that we lend to we really have really strong client selection and people are committed supporting their credits and believe that theyre the right things they want to hold on to them and youre seeing that really come through and youre seeing this now come through as were starting to get upgrades the other thing that we saw this quarter is our rv dealers had three significant rv dealers they were able to get rid of their excess inventory in and that really helped from an upgrade perspective so we have a lot of momentum in criticized im very optimistic fourth quarter will continue to be a very strong and continue into so i think we have momentum there and probably wont be a direct line down ebrahim but i think the trajectory is definite down i feel very positive about that ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and just maybe daryl so you mentioned drivers of loan growth you had pretty good ci growth the last few quarters is this still coming through partly driven by the peoples acquisition and kind of the footprint you acquired there and are we done with the runoff in cre could that kind of flat line from here or is that still going to be declining somewhat from third quarter levels daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah so let me start with the cre first so our pipelines are building in cre we havent had large pipelines for a while there so its going to take us probably a couple quarters for those pipelines to fill up and start seeing it hit on the balance sheet but we are making really good progress in our cre portfolio and that gives me confidence as we get into we wont be shrinking cre but well be growing cre so its another oar in the water that will give us more momentum from a revenue growth perspective from that so i think thats very positive mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 as far as growth this quarter it was continued growth i mean our specialty businesses that we have corporate and institutional fund banking mortgage warehouse franchise all were really strong growers this quarter when you saw the quarter play out we were a little soft in the first part of the quarter but we finished the quarter really strong you can see it in end of period loan balances and we have a lot of momentum going into the fourth quarter so thats good when you look at our regions that we have our middlemarket the areas that really are to highlight there are austin and baltimore new jersey york pa richmond virginia all those continue to progress and go really be positive so i would say we have good momentum in the lending side and feel good about the revenue projections that we have ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks just one followup on the previous response you gave to gerard if we dont get a rate cut in the fourth quarter in november december or at least one of those does that change your outlook on the nii nim from here daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah everything i said going through that list ebrahim was structural thats going on in our balance sheet that has no impact on interest rates so i feel comfortable that were going up if rates stay flat or if they actually go up or down were relatively neutral from a interest rate risk percentage and its hard to be exact but were as neutral as you can be with a balance sheet and the complexities that you have so i feel good that we have an upward trajectory in margin and net interest income ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah operator thank you our next question will come from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning daryl daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so i wanted to ask on deposit betas i think you noted that youre assuming a deposit beta in now deposit betas on the way up or closer to the mid if i recall correctly so do you expect that betas will mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 accelerate from as you go into next year and as we see more rate cuts and get closer to the betas that you saw on the way up daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i think of it maybe its my simple mind or whatever but i think that if our betas went up i think we peaked at about on the way down well probably end up at at some point its really the pace and how quickly you get there but i felt really good about what weve been able to do at the end of september and feel good that well have a good at least a beta repricing down in the fourth quarter and that hopefully will continue to move forward as we get into but all things being equal i dont think were going back to where we were but i feel very positive that our businesses are lowering rates with a lot of good planning that we had in the company our treasury team with all the businesses worked really hard to come up with good strategies and really good implementation and weve tested that and feel really good at where were headed manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then just on in terms of the loan growth you were just speaking about as we get into next year i mean it sounds like loan growth will accelerate as you start to build those cre loans in terms of funding that loan growth do you expect to grow deposits in line with loan growth next year or is there room to bring down the cash balances i noticed that they didnt go down that much this quarter is there some room to utilize cash balances and maybe grow deposits a little bit slower next year daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp well manan im a big believer that we want to operate the company being always on when i say always on what that means is we are always out there trying to get deposits from all of our customers we wont pay the highest rates we wont pay the lowest rates but well always be out there asking for deposits weve had four consecutive quarters of customer growth and deposits we will continue to focus on growing customer deposits i think its important if you think of a boat if youre growing loans you need to grow deposits so you dont go in a circle and all that so you need to continue to move going forward i would actually like to grow deposits faster than loans to be honest with you and continue to shrink some of our noncore funding if were able to do that manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it so it sounds like that core deposits continue to grow youll pay down some of the noncore funding and would the securities balances grow as well as you move away from cash or would you expect to stay at this level of cash daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp if you look at where we are right now we have about billion between the two we are putting more money into the investment portfolio again weve been very methodical all year and increasing our investment portfolio increases and thats played out really well for us you saw we had nice increases will probably be in the towards the end of the year early first quarter and sometime in from a yield perspective so we will continue to grow our investment portfolio we have billion in maturity in the fourth quarter well probably invest billion in the fourth quarter and then well reevaluate and see how plays out mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 from a cash at the fed perspective we probably will operate with cash at fed no at billion we wont probably go much lower than that but i think we just have a lot of flexibility where we are right now right now were sitting on about billionplus at the fed so we got a lot of flexibility manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator thank you our next question will come from christopher spahr with wells fargo please go ahead christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you good morning so just a question on the loans audio gap daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp chris youre breaking out christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc oh apologies can you hear me better now or is it still bad daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp i can now yes christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay sorry about that just for the loans in the fourth quarter relative to period end of billion just is there upside to that if cre stabilizes or do you see some more out some little bit more runoff and paydowns in that portfolio and then stabilizing into daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i think youre going to see runoff in cre for at least a couple more quarters first quarter for sure fourth quarter first quarter maybe second quarter it depends on how quickly our pipelines build and what type of loans that were making whether its permanent or construction loans from that perspective but were kind of going to operate with about of our loan book being in cre is kind of a mix that were going to have moving forward from that projection so its pipelines are building and peter and his team will do a great job and try to meet the needs of our clients and communities as we move forward so but well do it the right way but i wouldnt expect cre balances to grow until midnext year conservatively christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 okay and then during the quarter you said that a basis point lower in rates could actually effectively wipe out the criticized loans in the cre do i have that correct and if so then just kind of getting back to the earlier questions like the timing is it that last audio gap daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i didnt get the last part of your question christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc or is it going to be kind of daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i got the first part i didnt get the last part chris christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc sure apologies about the connection just whats the timing of that if you do get basis points lower in the curve whats the timing for the benefits on the criticized cre daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah so we have a good downward trajectory in criticized i dont like to use the word wipe out i dont think thats appropriate we have a longterm history chris of working with our clients and staying with them when things are stressful and we will continue to do that as long as they support their loans that i will so were always going to have some criticized loans thats just who we are its in our dna it also makes our clients very loyal to us so thats going to continue from that perspective but i do feel really good fourth quarter trajectory down i do believe that we will continue with a good trajectory down in and all that but we arent going to wipe out criticized balances christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah operator thank you our next question will come from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys nice quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp thank you david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc on the deposit front appreciate the outlook on the beta that you mentioned i was curious on what your thoughts were on the noninterestbearing deposit piece as a part of that deposit outlook i know youre still running off broker deposits so thats a part of that decline that youve been talking about for but are you factoring in a little bit more runoff on noninterestbearing side within that and can you talk about how close we are to a trough in those deposits daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp so when you look at our noninterest bearing i would say that the commercial and consumer side has really slowed down significantly there might be a little bit of disintermediation that occurs but i wouldnt say very much as we move forward i think what you have though in our noninterest bearing is just a function of who we are is that we have balances from our ics business and those balances tend to be volatile and sometimes you see swings of that going back and forth we will try to point those out and all that but youre going to have some volatility with that but i think for the most part what we said several quarters ago that we thought wed average around noninterest bearing i think thats playing out when you exclude our broker deposits from that perspective so i feel really good from a noninterestbearing perspective and i think the thing as you look forward that the value of free deposits as rates come down is less so we have to work harder to keep our interest rate spreads and margins higher just because you arent getting as much benefit from a noninterest bearing and were aware of that were definitely keen into how that plays out david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great thanks switching to loan growth appreciated all the color you gave on the drivers for i think you mentioned those more specialty lines and that middlemarket utilization was actually down a little bit when do you expect that utilization to start to move up more meaningfully i mean if you could just talk about the competitive landscape within ci overall thatd be great daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah well within commercial we did have the increase like i said in our dealer services seems like theres a lot more cars on the lots now which is driving that utilization up but netnet its still down some of it could be postelection thats what people seems to be defaulting to when you talk to clients in the marketplaces and in the markets we serve we have a lot of good things going on in the marketplaces and i think there will be a lot of growth needs over time its just a matter of when that will happen its hard to actually pin that down to be honest with you dave but we are working as hard as we can and were there for our clients when they need us if you look at lines our lines actually continue to grow so were actually making more lines available for our clients so we are growing our customers and accounts from that perspective and eventually they will start to draw on them mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp thank you operator thank you our next question will come from frank schiraldi with piper sandler please go ahead frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning daryl daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp good morning frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co i know theres i guess just one last one on loan growth i mean i know theres a lot of moving parts here you mentioned the billion in average for next quarter which would be sort of growth linked quarter do you think thats a pretty good bogey even going forward from there as you talk about pipelines building maybe cre has a couple more quarters to trough is that a decent bogey or do you think you could see quarterly growth maybe even accelerate from that sort of linked quarter on annualized number daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp we are still in the midst of our planning season for frank i would love to tell you that answer right now i would say its anywhere to maybe a little bit less than continuously to maybe a little bit more than might be an average give or take were going to do the right thing and support our customers and the communities thats the most important thing we do from that we are very selective in the customers that we do business with from that but that said we will get as much growth as we think is prudent out in the marketplace we arent going to stretch or change our credit levels and all that so well just see how it plays out but ill give you more color on that at next earnings call frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay fair enough and then you also talked about the repricing of the back book and i think you just mentioned kind of on the security side where you think yields could get to if we just for modeling purposes we think about the loan book repricing you set aside rate movements for a minute and just any sort of color you could give in terms of where we sit now with rates where they are currently what youre seeing or what the sort of pickup is on a quarterly basis on loan yields from the repricing of the back book mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah so ill give you a high level of what were seeing on this past quarter so when you look at our ci portfolio and we look at these are all fixed rate loan categories the ci fixed rate loan is averaging up about on whats rolling offrolling on the cre is averaging up about mortgage is averaging about little over consumers at about netnet if you blend that altogether of all the fixed rate loans rolling onrolling off its around 150basispoint benefit frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co great okay thanks for the color daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp youre welcome operator thank you our next question will come from john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning daryl daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi in terms of expenses i mean you put up some pretty good operating leverage this quarter it looks like your outlook implies some continued positive operating leverage nearterm could you give us your thoughts as you look into what type of acceleration in that positive operating leverage is possible i believe right now the streets looking at about to basis points positive operating leverage for you guys as we look into the full year curious on your thoughts on what you believe is achievable daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah so were still putting together i do believe we will have positive operating leverage for whether were or basis points i think youre in the neighborhood of where plan will end out but we are on have it all kind of figured out and everybodys agreed to it but we will get there i feel very confident we will get there from that if you look at the expenses that we guided they were up a little bit in the fourth quarter and thats mainly due to projects that we have we have a fair amount of projects going on in the company and were making a lot of progress we do have an increase there the other thing that were doing is weve had a pretty good year from a performance perspective both financially weve made good progress on our asset quality and good loan and deposit growth and just improving and getting mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 good some of our priorities accomplished so we actually are increasing our corporatewide incentives in fourth quarter for payout for everybody for a good year that said i still feel that is going to be a better year than to be honest with you we continue to have a lot more work to do and make progress but we have a lot of positive momentum now and need to reward the people that are making it happen in the company and feel good about that john pancari q analyst evercore isi great all right thank you thats helpful and then on the credit side your loan loss reserve ratio as a percentage of loans ticked down a bit or so this quarter i guess at around basis points where it stands now where do you see that trending here you cited the expected decline in criticized that youll see in the quarter and then pretty good trajectory there fair to assume continued modest decline here in that ratio is that fair to assume as you look out daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i think when you look at it this past quarter we had some good macro factor positives with ph crepi being much more positive and that helped drive a downward drop in criticized which is good i think as you look forward though we are growing all of our lending categories so you would have a mix change that youre seeing occur in the balance sheet and that mix change is more heavy on the consumer side consumers definitely have for the most part higher overall spreads and yields but they also come with higher net charge offs so youre seeing a mix change so right now its were feeling really good where were operating right now around could it be a little lower than that maybe could it be a little bit higher than that possibly it really depends on how quick that mix change happens we look at it obviously from a net overall spread and making sure were getting the good returns on the assets that were putting on our balance sheet so its a good capital use for our shareholders so we think were doing the right thing from that perspective but i think its the mix shift that could potentially play out over the next couple of years of having just a little bit higher chargeoff company as we get a little bit more diversified john we are really trying to be a much more diversified company not so much relying on cre we never were but really try to have much more diversification so we have strong consumer businesses ci businesses as well as cre businesses and a lot of great fee businesses like ics and wealth out in the marketplace so were really if you look at all the things that we present at the investors and all that its really talking more of a diversified company as we move forward john pancari q analyst evercore isi thanks daryl very helpful daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah operator thank you our next question will come from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey all this is nathan stein on behalf of matt oconnor i wanted to ask about the nim trajectory given it came in strong this quarter at and you expect it to be low next quarter so this is above your prior guide to be in the high in the second half of the year in september i think youd said a range nim makes sense for next year have your thoughts changed regarding the nim trajectory given how strong its been todate daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp so what i would tell you is that i think we feel comfortable in the low for a fourth quarter margin and well give you guidance in january when we do our next earnings call that feel really positive about the momentum we have good repricing and reactivity on the deposit side it is really going well and good roll on and roll off rates on our fixed rate loan assets as well so i think we have a lot of positive momentum nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then kind of a nuanced question but other revenue was in line with levels and i think you had previously suggested it would come down a bit on lower syndication revenues and interchange fees did those come in a bit better than you had expected or was it something else that kind of helped these and then how do you expect this fee line to trend going forward daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i would say that within the other the two largest categories are loan syndications and merchant and card fees those tend to be going very well and thats really what drives that other category are those two line items for the most part nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp all right thank you operator thank you our next question will come from zach westerlind with ubs please go ahead zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc good morning this is zach on for erika i just had a quick followup on the expense question and i know you mentioned that there were some projects that are going to hit in the fourth quarter could you just clarify if those are onetime type projects or is that expected to stay in the run rate daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2024 its a mix zach some of the things that come online like our new data centers that were putting on are coming online fourth quarter thats going to be in run rate we also have some project expenses that we have that are more being expensed in the fourth quarter from that so its really a mix that we have there well give you guidance in january and give you good projections but like i said i think were going to have good strong positive operating leverage in so i feel good about that and well give you more specifics as we get in january zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc helpful appreciate that and then just on the credit front clearly you guys have made a bunch of progress with better net chargeoffs trending down credit quality trends looking pretty good can you just remind us how you think about throughthecycle chargeoff number if youre able to kind of share your thoughts around that daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp so if you look historically our throughthecycle chargeoff is basis points but what i said on an earlier question is that the mix of our loan portfolio is changing and as that portfolio mix changes having more consumer as a percentage of total loans that will drive higher just allowance balances its still good we look at it to make sure that we have a good net spread on those loans good capital return on the loans that were making there so its nothing to be concerned about its just that its a mix change that you have as we continue to be a more diversified company moving forward zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks for taking my questions daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president mt bank corp yeah operator thank you at this time i would like to turn the call back over to brian klock for any additional or closing remarks brian klock executive vice president headmarket and investor
