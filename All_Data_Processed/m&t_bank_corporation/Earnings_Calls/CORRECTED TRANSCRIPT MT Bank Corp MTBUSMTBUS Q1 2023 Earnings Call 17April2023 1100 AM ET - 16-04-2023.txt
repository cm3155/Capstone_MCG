morning everyone our first quarter results reflect the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity position as well as the impact of our merger with peoples united bank compared to last years first quarter revenues have grown over million or translating into positive operating leverage yearoveryear preprovision net revenues have more than doubled since last year to billion credit remained solid with net chargeoffs still below our longterm average capital levels remained strong with the cet1 ratio estimated to end the first quarter at during the quarter we repurchased million in common shares which represented of our outstanding common stock and the board approved an or per share increase in the quarterly common dividend to per share tangible common equity per share increased to per share in addition april marked the oneyear anniversary of the closing of the peoples united acquisition were pleased with the results of the largest acquisition in our companys history the tangible book value dilution was only and has been earned back already merger costs were less than anticipated at the time of announcement targeted expense synergies have largely been realized and are now in the run rate as a result of the above the return on investment and eps accretion have exceeded those expected at the time the deal was announced lets take a look at the first quarter results diluted gaap earnings per common share were for the first quarter of down compared with in the fourth quarter of net income for the quarter was million lower than the million in the linked quarter on a gaap basis mts first quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of and an annualized rate of return on average common equity of this compares with rates of and respectively in the previous quarter included in gaap results were aftertax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to million in the first quarter and million in the sequential quarter representing per common share in both quarters pretax mergerrelated expenses of million related to the peoples united acquisition were included in the fourth quarters gaap results these mergerrelated charges translate to million aftertax or per common share there were no mergerrelated expenses in this years first quarter in accordance with the secs guidelines this mornings press release contains a reconciliation of gaap and non gaap results including tangible assets and equity consistent with our longterm practice mt provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the aftertax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions we believe this information provides investors with a better picture of the longterm earnings power of the institution mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 mts net operating income for the first quarter which excludes intangible amortization and the mergerrelated expenses was million down from the million in the linked quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share were for the recent quarter compared with in 2022s fourth quarter net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and in the recent quarter the comparable returns were and in the fourth quarter of as a reminder gaap and net operating earnings for the fourth quarter of were impacted by certain noteworthy events this included a million gain related to the sale of the mt insurance agency as well as a million contribution to mts charitable foundation these items collectively netted and did not materially impact net income next well take a deeper dive into the underlying trends that generated our first quarter results taxable net interest income was billion for the first quarter of slightly below the linked quarter the million decrease was driven largely by million in lower net interest income reflecting the two days shorter calendar quarter partially offset by a million positive impact from our hedging program and million from higher average earning asset volumes net of higher average interestbearing liability volumes the net interest margin for the past quarter was down basis points from the in the linked quarter the primary driver of the decrease to the margin was the impact from a higher level of borrowing which we estimate reduced the margin by basis points this was partially offset by the impact from higher rates on earning assets net of deposit funding which we estimate added basis points all other factors had a negligible impact on the margin total average loans and leases were billion during the quarter up billion or compared to the linked quarter looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared to the fourth quarter commercial and industrial loans and leases increased billion or to billion with billion being broadly based and million of growth in average dealer floor plan balances during the first quarter average commercial real estate loans decreased by million or to billion the decline was driven largely by lower permanent mortgages as average construction loan balances were essentially flat residential real estate loans increased by million or about to billion due largely to the timing of the retention of originations throughout the prior quarter endofperiod balances were essentially flat sequentially average consumer loans were up million or about to billion recreational finance loan growth continues to be the main driver of increased balances and these average loans grew million or average earning assets excluding interestbearing cash on deposit at the federal reserve increased billion or due to the billion growth in average loans and billion increase in average investment securities although average interestbearing cash balances have decreased million to billion during the first quarter of this year they came in higher than our initial projections the sequential quarterly decline in cash reflects loan growth and the drop in deposit balances partially offset by the proceeds from longterm borrowings issued during the quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 consistent with our expectations and normal seasonal outflows deposits declined sequentially however the billion or sequential average decline was slightly better than our expectations at the january earnings call we remain focused on growing and retaining deposits our experience in prior rising rate environments reminds us to expect increased competition for deposits and changing customer behavior leading to a mix shift within the deposit base during the first quarter average demand deposits declined billion savings and interestbearing checking deposits increased billion and time deposits increased billion average commercial deposits declined a net billion as business owners shifted billion out of operating demand deposit accounts and into both on and offbalance sheet sweep accounts to earn a higher return on their excess balances as well as to make distributions almost twothirds of the decline in noninterestbearing deposits was offset by movement into onbalance sheet sweep accounts where those average balances increased billion during the first quarter of turning to consumer deposits they declined a net million in the first quarter as billion in outflows were partially offset by a billion increase in average time deposits lower levels of activity in the capital markets and seasonal factors also impacted average balances for the following lines of business trust fund demand balances declined billion municipal deposits declined million and escrow deposits declined million average brokered cds increased billion sequentially due almost entirely from growth during the previous quarter turning to noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in the first quarter compared with million in the linked quarter mt normally receives an annual distribution from the bayview lending group during the first quarter of the year this distribution was million in and million in last years first quarter as noted earlier the fourth quarter of last year included a million gain from the sale of the mt insurance agency excluding these two items noninterest income was up million or sequentially trust income of million in the recent quarter was flat sequentially service charges on deposit accounts were million compared to million in the fourth quarter the increase primarily reflects a full quarter of service charges on acquired customer deposit accounts after these fees were waived in october and november of last year mortgage banking revenues were million in the recent quarter up from the linked quarter revenues from our residential mortgage business were million in the first quarter compared with million in the prior quarter commercial mortgage banking revenues were million in the first quarter compared to million in the final quarter of other revenue from operations excluding the distribution from bayview lending group in this years first quarter and the gain from the sale of the mt insurance agency in the sequential quarter were million up million sequentially turning to expenses operating expenses which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and merger related expenses were billion sic billion in the first quarter of this year little changed from the fourth quarter of last year mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 as is typical for mts first quarter results operating expenses for the recent quarter included approximately a gretzky of seasonally higher compensation costs relating to accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirementeligible employees the hsa contribution the impact of annual incentive compensation payouts on the 401k match and fica payments as well as the annual reset in fica payments and unemployment insurance those same items amounted to an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately million in last years first quarter as usual we expect those seasonal factors to decline significantly as we enter the second quarter excluding the charitable donation in the fourth quarter of last year and the seasonally higher compensations in the first quarter operating expenses increased million sequentially the increase was due largely to million in higher compensation and benefits cost largely related to higher head count in the first quarter million in higher fdic insurance expense reflecting a higher assessment rate for the industry million in higher amortizing and marketing expenses and million in professional services expenses directly attributable to the pending sale of mts collective investment trust business given the prospect for slowing revenue growth we remain focused on diligently managing expenses and continuing to generate positive operating leverage the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization and merger related expenses from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was in the recent quarter compared with in 2022s fourth quarter and in the first quarter of last year next lets turn to credit the allowance for credit losses amounted to billion at the end of the first quarter up million from the end of the linked quarter in the first quarter we recorded a million provision for credit losses compared to million in the fourth quarter net chargeoffs were million in the first quarter compared to million in last years fourth quarter the reserve build was largely due to a combination of loan growth and the anticipation of declining values for office and healthcare properties partially offset by improved expectation for hotel retail and multifamily property prices at the end of the first quarter nonaccrual loans were billion an increase of million compared to the prior quarter and that represented of loans up basis points sequentially as noted net chargeoffs for the recent quarter amounted to million including amounts that reflect updated appraisals of nonaccrual office loans annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans were basis points for the first quarter compared to basis points in the fourth quarter loans days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were million at the end of the recent quarter compared to million sequentially in total of these days past due loans were guaranteed by governmentrelated entities turning to capital mts common equity tier ratio was an estimated compared with at the end of the fourth quarter the decrease was due in part to growth in riskweighted assets and the impact of the repurchase of million in common shares which represented of our outstanding common stock tangible common equity totaled billion up slightly from the end of the prior quarter tangible common equity per share amounted to per share up from the end of the year turning to the outlook as we look forward to the rest of this year we believe we are well positioned to navigate through the challenging economic conditions however the rapidly changing interest rate expectations combined with continued pressure on funding affect our outlook for the full year of as a reminder the acquisition of mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 peoples united closed on april and thus the outlook for includes four quarters of operations and balances from the acquired company compared to only three quarters during our outlook also reflects the sale of the mt insurance agency that closed in october of last year and even though the sale of the collective investment trust business is expected to close in the first half of this year our outlook includes the full year of operations from this business first lets talk about net interest income outlook the outlook for interest rates in the economy continues to change frequently since march the 10year us government bond yield has dropped basis points and the forward curve has changed meaningfully as well we expect taxable net interest income to grow in the to range when compared to the billion during this range reflects different rates of deposit balance growth deposit pricing and loan growth consistent with the current forward curve our forecast incorporates two basis point cuts in the final quarter of this year as we noted on the first quarter call a key driver of net interest income in will be the ability to efficiently fund earning asset growth we expect continued intense competition for deposits in the face of industrywide outflows full year average total deposit balances are expected to be down low single digits compared to the billion average during during the first quarter we issued billion in senior debt and will utilize the combination of fhlb funding and senior debt over the course of this year as needed to ensure that we can continue to meet the loan demands of our customers we continue to expect the deposit mix to shift toward higher cost deposits with declines expected in demand deposits and growth in time and onbalance sheet sweep this is expected to translate to a through thecycle interestbearing deposit beta in the high30 to low40 range taking all of these factors into account we anticipate the net interest margin to be slightly below for the full year of and to continue to migrate towards the long term range we have been discussing for the past couple quarters next lets discuss the drivers of earning asset growth we currently plan to grow the securities portfolio by billion compared to the billion balance at the end of march of this year with the addition of longer duration mortgagebacked securities throughout the year looking at average loans we expect average loan and lease balances during to grow in the to range when compared to the full year average of billion we anticipate growth to continue in the second quarter and then for average balances to be flat to slightly down over the second half of the year this implies total average loan and lease balances in the fourth quarter of to be up to from the billion average during the fourth quarter of the mix of ci cre and consumer loans inclusive of consumer real estate is almost onethird each as of the end of march we expect this trend to shift slightly as ci growth outpaces cre as we have seen over the past three quarters higher levels of interest rates are expected to slow down the growth in our consumer loan book in after these average loans grew in the first quarter we expect the indirect portfolio to be relatively flat over the remainder of the year turning to fees excluding the million gain on the sale of the mt insurance agency in the fourth quarter of as well as securities losses net interest income sorry noninterest income was billion in we expect noninterest income growth to be in the to range compared to the billion in this mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 outlook for noninterest income includes the impact of a bulk purchase of residential mortgage servicing rights that we completed at the end of this years first quarter turning to expenses we anticipate expenses excluding mergerrelated costs the charitable contribution and intangible amortization to be up to when compared to the billion during recall that approximately half of this increase reflects an extra quarter of peoples united expenses in addition this outlook for net operating expenses includes the impact of the previously noted mortgage servicing rights purchase we do not anticipate incurring any material merger related costs in and intangible amortization is expected to be in the million to million range during turning to credit we expect credit losses to migrate towards mts long term average of basis points although the quarterly cadence could be lumpy provision expense over the year will follow the cecl methodology and will be affected by changes in the macroeconomic outlook as well as loan balances for we expect the taxable equivalent tax rate to be in the range finally turning to capital mts common equity tier ratio of at march comfortably exceeds the required regulatory minimum threshold which takes into account our stress capital buffer or scb we believe the current level of core capital exceeds that needed to safely run the company and to support lending in our communities we plan to return excess capital to shareholders at a measured pace over the long term however in the near term we plan to maintain a cet1 ratio slightly above the current level until the current economic uncertainty abates with that lets open up the call to questions before which shelby will briefly review the instructions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just wanted to go back to the deposit beta and the nii guidance so high to low deposit beta if you can unpack that a little bit in terms of how has your view around deposit pricing behavior changed today relative to january and that could be because fed funds that events of the last one month post svb just give us a flavor of commercial versus retail are you seeing differences and has one changed a lot more than the other would appreciate any color there mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp sure ebrahim the deposit betas are largely moving consistent with how we thought they would when we think about the cumulative throughthecycle beta we really havent changed our thought process there what happens is kind of from quartertoquarter you might see the pace at which we get from where we are today to that terminal cumulative beta shifts a little bit depending on the competition and obviously the first quarter there was a lot of disruption going on in the market but generally the most elastic deposits are the commercial and the wealth deposits and when we look underneath the hood there we see that the betas of the commercial deposits are in kind of the mid to low and that will be higher in commercial if we add in small business that comes down a little bit because those deposits tend to be a little bit less price sensitive and then when you get in the consumer space youre in kind of the midteens deposit betas so far and with that number that includes the impact of time deposits if we didnt include the impact of time deposits on those consumer deposit betas theyd be pretty low but we tend to include the time when we think about the beta because we see time for consumers as a substitute product in rising rates for money market savings and savings accounts and so we try to think about the allin funding cost which includes time deposits which is why we include those and so when we look at the quarter and we look at the decline for me a couple things kind of jump out first is that the decline in deposits this first quarter versus last years first quarter are almost identical and so given that last year was kind of a more normal year and this had a lot of activity going on for those numbers to be about the same when you look at as at that gave us a lot of we felt really good about that and the other thing is just a little bit about theres a normal seasonal decline that happens in the first quarter as commercial customers tend to make their distributions to prinicipal to pay taxes but underneath the surface its important to keep in mind that there are a couple things that affected deposit flows for us this quarter one was trust demand balances were down about billion right so of those balances were trust demand balances which move with economic activity and another millionodd was escrow and with mortgage rates moving theres less activity and so a little bit less action in the escrow accounts and so outside of that i see it as very typical seasonal decline in commercial balances offset by folks moving commercial folks in particular moving some of their balances into onbalance sheet sweep or interestbearing and so we kind of look at those two categories together as one and when rates go down we see deposits flow into noninterestbearing and when rates go up theres a different mix of interestbearing and noninterestbearing but nothing that were seeing thats outside of our history our expectations so hopefully that i said a lot gives you a little color ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc no it was a lot and thank you so much and just on a separate question i think you mentioned you provided some made some reserves against office cre obviously a lot of focus there give us a perspective of is there a pool within your office cre book that you view or within the cre book at higher risk and how do you frame the loss content if some of these buildings end up in foreclosure and you had to have a distress sale around that is it easy to handicap that right now and just your thought process in managing that portfolio darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 sure office obviously is getting a lot of attention in the world and weve been focused on it for quite some time when we go through it and we look at what we think the loss content is its a little bit tricky to estimate right now only because there hasnt been a lot of asset sales i think in talking to our team prior to the call they suggested that there were four properties that sold nationwide outside of manhattan and three in manhattan in the first quarter so thats not a lot of activity to get a market price so everything thats happening is everyones looking at cash flows and nois and so when you think about the cash flows as we think about our clients its one of the things thats really important to keep in mind is about twothirds of our clients in real estate in general have put on fixed floating to fixed swaps on their loans and so the impact of the interest rate increases hasnt really affected their ability to carry the loan and then we start looking at whats coming due and so you worry about maturities and the ability to for folks to refi and the pace at which those loans might come due and so when i look forward when we look forward into the next couple of quarters in aggregate we have about million of office maturing each quarter for the next two and then it actually drops down in the fourth quarter and when we look at the ltvs of whats maturing were in the neighborhood of of those maturing loans have an ltv of or less and again its important to keep in mind that not all of those ltvs are calculated off of brand new appraisals some of them are will be a little bit dated but when you look at some of the protections in place theres a bunch of room there so thats not to suggest that there will be no losses as you could see in our results for the quarter we did take some partial chargeoffs on a couple of office properties as we did get new appraisals on things that were troubled but there is still room there and i think for us we keep looking at whats the pace at which the loans are maturing and i think what youll see certainly for mt and i would expect although i dont know other peoples portfolios that the office story is one that will play itself out over multiple quarters if not multiple years because of the maturities because of the fact that most people will hedge if they got a floating rate note and a lot of the leases are still not maturing because office leases tend to be longer dated than residential when we look at our office leases the numbers something in the neighborhood of dont come due until after so lots i guess the long winded way of saying its a concern were watching it its our portfolio is pretty broadly spread across our footprint and it will play itself out over the next several quarters ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats great color thank you so much operator and well take our next question from manan gosalia with morgan stanley manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc just on the deposit side its not surprising that deposits ended the quarter below the average can you talk a little bit about the trajectory of deposits in the second half of march how much i guess how much the deposit mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 balances changed through from feb through the impact from svb through quarter end and even if you have whats been happening quartertodate this quarter darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp sure i guess i would just caution on drawing cause and effect that the numbers are the numbers but whether the decline that happened in march was specifically attributable to the scv sic svb or signature challenges is difficult to say just because theres normal activity that happens in the first quarter right as we mentioned the trust demand balances move based on capital markets not an activity not necessarily because of an exogenous event but roughly when you look at the decline in total deposits over the quarter was about happened before march and happened in march so a little bit heavier march but as you get into that march timeframe thats when we got our distribution from bayview which is when distributions often get paid right in front of taxes for commercial clients and so when we look at the effect on the bank of the changes that happened what we tended to see was we opened up more accounts in our business and middle market space than we would typically in a month and we saw balances come on to our balance sheet as people sought to diversify and there were some cases where that went the other way but netnet we were flat to slightly up from what our expectations were given all the activity that was happening in the marketplace so from our perspective we were in line with what we thought for the quarter and pleased with how the client base and our teams reacted to everything that was going on in the world in the month of march manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and i guess how confident are you at this stage that deposit balances have stabilized and to the extent we noticed that the cds essentially doubled on a qonq basis so how confident are you that a the deposit balances have stabilized and then b given that youve kept your deposit beta assumptions what would cause you to increase your deposit rates as we went through the middle of the year and maybe if you have it what were your spot deposit rates as of march thanks darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp ill start with i dont have the spot deposit rates in front of me and we can follow up with that but in terms of the stability of deposits again keep in mind that its the action that were seeing right now is really in noninterest bearing and thats really being driven by commercial deposits when we look at consumer balances outside of some outflow in january and when i say that i mean noninterestbearing theyve been relatively stable through february and march and when you look in the consumer space what youre seeing is shift between interestbearing categories and so were seeing movement from savings and money market into time which is pretty typical during rising rates and the net is some small outflow in dda which again is pretty standard in the first quarter of the year in the commercial space outside of the normal seasonal activity what will happen is deposits noninterest bearing deposits will start to stabilize as customers get down to the level of deposits they need to keep in their operational accounts to make payroll to pay accounts payable and the like and excess will not necessarily leave mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 the balance sheet it will just shift into some form of interestbearing it could be interest checking or could be an onbalance sheet sweep and so there will be some decline and there always is for mt in these environments when we look through the past we see that when rates have gone down to we tend to have an increase of about or percentage points in the percentage of our deposit base that sits in noninterestbearing as rates rise that goes back the other direction and thats just exactly what were seeing now and whats happening and so over time if you went all the way back into preglobal financial crisis for banks not just for mt but for the industry noninterestbearing deposits were in the kind of range of total deposits and they peaked at for us and about for the industry and so depending and that was the last time fed funds was anywhere near the rates that they are today on the flip side time deposits were a huge percentage of total deposits in the industry in that time period upwards of or and theyve come all the way down into the to range i give you that as context to say that whats going to happen what we think will happen is youll continue to see some outflow of deposits but it will stabilize as rates start to stop increasing and what youll see is less movement out and more movement across categories again for consumers we think that will be from interest products like money market and savings into time and for commercial customers it will be from noninterest bearing dda into interestbearing things like sweep and commercial checking and so for us for the rest of the year we think things start to stabilize as we get into the second quarter and second half and the buildback in commercial checking balances will start in anticipation of next years first quarter its a cycle that follows itself very predictably every year manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks so much very helpful operator and well take our next question from john pancari with evercore john pancari q analyst evercore isi morning darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp morning john how are you doing john pancari q analyst evercore isi all right want to see if you can give us a little more color on the updated loan growth guidance the to where are you seeing some of the better trends coming from because looks like it was upwardly revised from where you had expected it coming out of last quarter thanks darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 yeah so john keep in mind that to includes four quarters of peoples this year in the averages versus three quarters last year right so some of that is in there i think we noted in the outlook that if you look based on the average balances in just the fourth quarter of last year were more in the to range and if you look at that a lot of thats happened already in the first quarter and based on where the first quarter loan balances ended just the averaging effect of that should carry a little bit of growth through the second quarter and then we expect things to kind of flatten out a little bit as we go through the back half of the year and thats how you thats just the math that gets the average into that range and really the i think the challenge that youre seeing is pipelines have been robust but theyre starting to slow down a little bit and were managing them to focus our liquidity on our best customers and our relationship customers and then in some instances in some of the consumer space as it is indirect and recfi with rates going up youre seeing a little less demand from the clients and therefore a little bit of a slowdown that will keep balances flat to slightly down in that space just as the duration of that portfolio is pretty short and so you need to continue to originate new to keep it flat or to grow it within the commercial world theres not a lot of activity thats really happening in cre theres not a lot of new construction and so what we would expect is you see for us and for the industry as loans mature a lot of capital and liquidity is devoted to those clients and keeping them around and then in the ci space weve seen a fairly broadbased growth whether its by geography or by industry type we did note that the dealer floor plan balances have grown theyre still maybe half of their long term average which is better than they were but theres some upside there and obviously you get a slowdown in indirect youll likely see an uptick in the dealer floor plan balances but those are kind of the spaces where were seeing activity and how we expect the rest of the year to play itself out john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks darren and then just secondly back to the office portfolio just darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah john pancari q analyst evercore isi a few things around that what percentage of the office book is criticized i believe last quarter you indicated about of it was criticized and in that ltv that you mentioned for what is maturing coming up do you have some granularity on what the refreshed ltvs look like as part of that and then lastly did you add to the commercial real estate reserve this quarter darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp okay lot in there let me try and make sure i get it all so the office criticized is still right around its up slightly but not up dramatically and the hotel criticized continues to come down so its important to keep that in mind because as we talk about the cre increase that youre asking about theres an offset within the whole cre allowance right weve seen some improvement in hotel and retail offset by some decline in office but we did add to the cre allowance in the quarter if you think about dollar amount its probably half to twothirds of the mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 million provision was allocated towards the net towards the cre portfolio the rest would be driven by growth in other portfolios when you look at the ltvs what weve seen in the ones that we have updated so far is were seeing somewhere between a and decline in some of the updated values of the properties that weve reappraised and so thats why you didnt hear me talk much about or ltvs because those ones are getting closer perhaps to where these properties might reappraise but ltvs and sub50 ltvs would seem to still have a lot of cushion before youre into any material loss content and so when we look at that we feel good about where we are it doesnt mean that were taking our eye off the ball but we feel good about where we are and again just to give a little more color on new york city office next quarter this quarter were in right now theres five loans that are maturing with a principal balance of million john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thank you darren operator and well take our next question from dave rochester with compass point david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hi good morning guys darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc on capital the buyback going forward it sounds like youre pretty much saying no buyback for or is that too strong a statement or is the thought just that youll wait to get your ccar results and then hope that the market is more stable at that point and go from there darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i think that zero is a strong statement when we look through the quarter and what we see with the pace of riskweighted asset growth we see the potential actually for kind of a trifecta and that we should see a little bit of riskweighted asset growth as rates are rising and liquidity is constrained we think that well start to see some increased margin and profitability of new lending activity which usually happens at this point in the cycle so well deploy capital to those opportunities first we will or we do anticipate closing the sale of the cit business in this quarter which will create a gain which will help with our capital ratios which should allow us to be in the market and repurchase some shares and at the same time maintain this kind of capital level that gives us a really nice cushion given the uncertainty in the market and while we wait for the scb mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 from our perspective if we run a little light for a quarter it doesnt mean that the capital is gone it just means it comes back a little bit later in the year but we think were in a position here which is nice where we can actually do all three we can grow riskweighted assets we can return capital and we can grow the capital ratios all at the same time david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc got it very helpful and then as a followup you mentioned your outlook on hotel retail and multifamily properties improved was just wondering if you could unpack that a little bit and just talk about what youre seeing that drives that improved outlook there and then you had mentioned i guess office properties at the as youre kind of redoing these ltvs are coming down maybe to if i heard that right is that how much youre actually marking these as well so that the npas that you have in the market you took this quarter is that roughly the magnitude or is it less just given that to really doesnt cut into a lot of those properties if those ltvs indiscernible thanks darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp sure yeah i cant write fast enough to keep up with all the questions that you got so if i miss one just let me know so in hotel and retail hotel in particular we saw that portfolio peak at kind of criticized back in the pandemic and what youre seeing is the return to travel a lot of capacity that came out of the system during those times and occupancy rates and revpar is really strong and so the nois on hotels are really strong and thats why youre seeing those come out of criticized and the asset value theyre holding up multifamily also continues to be strong i did not make a comment about multifamily values but multifamily has been very strong when you look at rent increases over the last months theyve been very strong and in fact rent in multifamily appreciated faster than interest rates did and so they should be well covered to handle moving interest rates and retail kind of played itself out largely through the pandemic and as the economy opened up weve typically seen retail sales of physical retail pretty darn close to where it was prepandemic when looking at volume between inperson and online so those have performed very well when you think about what was the last question well the david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc in terms of the marks on the office indiscernible darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so marks on these yeah david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so when you look at where some of these are reappraising they are coming the appraisals are coming down and affecting the ltv we would only put it into the allowance if we have something that is criticized or not performing and were worried about it and we think that it would affect the recoverable value and then we take that in and well put that through the allowance ultimately through chargeoffs david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great thank you darren operator and well take our next question from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning darren could you address how youre thinking about the risk of tougher regulations following the sivb fallout and barrs recent testimony including in areas like tlac and the elimination of the oci optout and how could we see this as we see this play out how could we see an effect on your appetite for buybacks and rwa growth darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so i guess couple of thoughts bill on the oci piece when weve had that in mind for the last three years and all the discussions that weve had over the prior number of years about putting the cash to work and the impact that that might have in the securities portfolio on aoci in our capital we were looking at both the cet1 ratio as well as the tangible common equity ratio and it was really the latter one that that gave us a little bit of agita in debating how fast and how much to put into securities and so from an oci perspective if that comes to pass and that goes into our capital ratios at the end of the quarter we had about billion in total marks across the afs and htm portfolios about million was pre tax the afs mark and so million aftertax its maybe basis points of cet1 and then if you look at the total youre maybe slightly below that call it 80ish basis points of cet1 if you had to put both through and so when we talk a little bit about our thoughts on capital and where were kind of managing the cet1 ratio for the next little while its giving ourselves some cushion as these things play themselves out and so from that perspective it wont surprise me if thats a change that happens but i think were well covered and well prepared should that play itself out when it comes to tlac thats really a longerterm change i think when you look at whats happening in the industry right now most organizations have been increasing their use of wholesale funding and bank notes which ultimately will help with tlac as it plays itself out and then theres always the question of how basel iv and those regulations come to pass and what the final proposals look like and so were trying to be mindful that those are changes that could come and not do something today that would put us in a place where we would have to raise equity or issue tlac at a suboptimal time mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful darren and thank you if i can follow up on your deposit remixing commentary earlier darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc whats the noninterestbearing mix thats implicit in your high30 to low40 beta expectation and following up on the commentary about that noninterestbearing mix perhaps declining to pregfc levels that you mentioned how are you thinking about that risk what would that mean for betas darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so ill try and unpack that for you i give the comment about where rates were or where balance sheets were pre gfc to give context right that most of the time when we talk about deposit betas in these industry forums the point of reference tends to be the last rising rate environment which was the to period where fed funds only got to about and so given where fed funds are today and well see how long they stay there its important to keep in mind what bank balance sheets look like back in that time period we might not get all the way back there we probably wont get all the way back there depending on how long rates stay at this level although it does look like theyll stay there longer than the last time rates rose and so when we look at the deposit mix and where things stabilize we tend to look at and think about demand deposits in conjunction with interest checking and onbalance sheet sweep and what weve been seeing is some decline in those balances over time as deposit balances come out of the system with the feds quantitative tightening that theyre doing and what we think well see which is included in that outlook is well see a continued shift from demand particularly commercial clients commercial and small business from noninterestbearing into interest checking and sweep and that over time you see those balances look maybe closer to from where they are today in those particular categories therell still be noninterest deposits on the consumer side and those you wont see as much movement into interestbearing products because they dont tend to switch categories like that and those are some of the factors that are implicit in those deposit betas and really the question to me is twofold where do fed funds ultimately end up and how long does it stay there bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thanks darren brian klock a executive vice president headmarkets and investor relations mt bank corp hey shelby this is brian were going to go for another minutes and weve got a bunch of analysts in the queue so maybe we can limit it to just one question for the analysts that are still there mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 operator absolutely operator instructions well take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys thanks for fitting me in here darren i want to circle back on the comment about nim being below for the full year and then trending to kind of that longer term average i guess first just to confirm is it still i think to the long term average that youve talked about darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp that is correct matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then in terms of i guess like the timing of getting there and what are some of the beside the obvious like if rates go to zero it will be the low end but like what are some of the kind of puts and takes like the versus and then lastly just indiscernible like any thoughts on the jumping off point for the end of this year thanks darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so matt the biggest driver of the change in our posture and thoughts on nim has really been the shift in funding sources right and so if you look at the work that we did in the first quarter the billion that we issued we had talked about issuing wholesale over the course of the year the markets were very receptive when we went out in january and so we pulled forward a bunch of that funding which had a big impact we talked about basis points on the nim and so where we stand today when you look at our asset sensitivity you can see were kind of plus or minus which is where we try to run the bank and so well see when we go through and we look at those factors and expectations that fed funds are starting to top out and likely based on the forward curve we see a decline in the end of the year thats where you start to see that margin start to come back down but as i mentioned with our asset sensitivity where it is its not going to drop precipitously because of the things that weve done with some of the forward starting swaps with the securities portfolio build with the mix of fixed rate assets on the balance sheet and what have you and so it will start to grind down into that range but given over the long run the reason weve talked about that range is because we expect over the long run that things normalize and what we mean by that is that the mix of deposits on the balance sheet looks more like what you would see in a normal rate environment its not extreme like where we had of the deposits in noninterest bearing thats not normal as that changes the margin comes down well see a different or a mix of the time deposits and what the rates are on time deposits and that will affect the margin well look at what percentage of the balance sheet sits in cash and securities and as those start to normalize youll see an improvement in the margin mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 and so its the shift in all of those categories that became very extreme through the pandemic that as they start to come back into what we would consider normal ranges thats why we think that to is a normal long term range for our bank and our balance sheet just kind of based on history and so well start to see that migration happen we started to see it obviously this quarter and at the end of last year and it will continue through how fast we get there it seems like things are moving pretty quickly right now just given quantitative tightening and how balances are shifting around the industry as we get to the end of the year and the jumping off point for the margin probably migrating towards the range for the last quarter of the year but theres a lot of factors that can get us there between now and then that would be kind of the low end of where i think we would end the year for the whole year were in the ballpark of high just based on that trajectory and then when as we go through the year and the balances the deposit balances reprice you see some migration down but it starts to level off as we get towards the back half of the year and you operate in that range through most of would be our expectation right now but keep in mind theres a lot of assumptions that go into that not the least of which is what the forward curve looks like matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats a lot of detail but just to summarize so you think you get to the kind of lower end of the to range by the end of the year but thats kind of relatively stable for next year with all the caveats that you have highlighted darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i would just alter that slightly and say that the bottom end of the range you probably dont see until the first half of next year that to but youre slowly moving down as we go through the year but as we get towards the end of the year the rate of decline slows and you kind of stabilize and hold flattish as we go through matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay that was helpful thanks so much operator and well take our next question from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey darren how is it going just a quick one on the fee guide going to from to growth is the entirety of that just the msr add that you mentioned you did at the end of the quarter darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp pretty much yeah mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then if i could just ph sneak in the same one on the costs side in terms of like the expected sale of the corporate trust sic collective investment trust business you gave us darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc the revenue number in the press release do you have an approximate idea of like when thats going to close so we can just kind of think about taking out the fees and the expenses relative to that over the as the course of the year goes on darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah sure we expected to close this quarter for safety for you guys i would assume that its out of the run rate for the second half of the year and youve got the revenue the expenses are not quite the same as revenue but theyre not far off which is one of the reasons why were contemplating this move ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it right and you were pretty clear that the rest of the cost guide is inclusive of the msr any cost related to the msr add darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp thats correct right and so in the guide we have both the full year of the cit business right now just to try and keep it applestoapples yearoveryear as well as to let you know that we made that msr purchase but other than that there are a few things that were kind of pulled forward in this quarter some advertising expense some of the items the costs related to that divestiture that wont repeat themselves to try and just to give you guys a little bit of color as to why we still feel good about the full year guide ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thank you operator and well take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey darren mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc were going to miss you congratulations on your run as cfo i guess well you started in so i know youve got a heavy hitter replacing you but good luck in the new role darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp thank you i appreciate it its been a run theres a lot that weve seen we loved bob and mark we went through a pandemic bought the largest bank and went through a couple of bank failures so its been an eventful time gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc it sure has and to help you in your new role your spot rated on your mychoice money market account is basis points were under in the account and over that jumps to darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp im just trying to help out the new cfo so that he has good numbers to report they will be chastising me about why balances are leaving but dont forget thats the offer rate not the portfolio rate but i appreciate that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc oh god yes no no i know absolutely but heres my question speaking of deposit rates can you share with us and that youve alluded to this in some of your answers if the fed reaches its terminal rate on fed funds in june lets say and does not cut even though i know youre looking at the forward curve that includes two cuts in the fourth quarter say they dont cut until maybe the first half of when does your deposit betas go flat after reaching the terminal rate and second if they go flat days afterwards or whatever you think the number would be do you then benefit from reinvesting the cash flows off of the securities portfolio into a higher rate environment assuming that fed doesnt cut the fed funds rate darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so when you start seeing a slowdown in deposit repricing history has been its typically one to two quarters after the fed stops and so i would expect even if the fed stopped in the summer and cut in the fourth quarter you wouldnt see a change in deposit betas in all likelihood until sometime in next year if you get into the space where they stop and then hold and it goes into the same thing would be true in terms of youd see deposit betas go up for a quarter or two after and then start to level off mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 in all of these things in the pricing in the ultimate beta theres a couple of factors to keep in mind right we always talk about it in terms of where fed funds is but as we look at the bank and the balance sheet theres a bunch of tradeoffs that are being made right and so for interestbearing deposits theres a cost that is borne that you need to offer to the customers but then theres other alternatives that you can look at to meet those funding needs its brokered money market its brokered cd its wholesale funding right and so our preference is if were going to give rate wed rather give it to our customers than to the capital markets but at the end of the day youre always making those tradeoffs and then its the mix shift that happens for our clients as they are a reflection of the economy just as any banks clients are consumers are going to keep some amount of money in their checking account that theyre comfortable with and every person has their own number but they wont go below it unless theyre in dire circumstances businesses are the same way and so theres a certain amount of deposits that are going to be on each banks balance sheet and then within each category the markets pretty perfect and we cant pay materially less for money market savings in buffalo than our competitors can and the same thing is true for time and the other categories and so theres a natural governor in the market that gets all of these different deposit categories to their normal what i would call their normal pricing right and then what kind of differentiates one bank from the next is their mix and our advantage has always been that we tend to focus on operating accounts whether its consumers or commercial customers and we have a slightly higher mix of those in our funding which ultimately helps our cost of funds and so those will be the things that will determine where we end up and how big our beta is perhaps compared to others but we think its the betas continue after fed funds stops for a little bit and the terminal amount is as much a function of your mix of deposits as how high the absolute number goes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good again congratulations and well talk to you in the future in your new role thanks darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp thanks gerard operator and well take our next question from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey darren thanks for squeezing me in darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 im curious in the aftermath of svb which was obviously all over the news what are you hearing now from your large deposit customers right are they looking to diversify did you guys lose balances to larger banks has the storm now passed just any color you could provide how this is impacting a bank like yours would be really helpful thanks darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah no happy to the long story short was that the change was a positive for us for adding clients and adding accounts and so were ph helpful that we were able to serve as a source of strength and to help some of these folks out when these changes happened and we were i would say a net slightly positive as a result of all the disruption that happened in these various markets for our clients when we look at particularly our commercial clients and the average tenure theyre 25year relationships and so they know us well and they tend to worry a little bit less that said there were some people who chose to move some money into some of the money funds for diversification for rates as well as some of their comfort level we didnt lose a ton to be honest with you to the larger organizations but what i would say is in some of those shifts we were a recipient of balances as much as we saw an outflow and so when you add in some of the accounts that we opened during the crisis the net was a slight positive and so for us it was it wasnt the big shift in balances that many were anticipating more i would say as much a continuation of the trend that weve been talking about of as quantitative tightening happens as rates are moving up and the money the rates paid on the money funds always moves faster than the deposit accounts on the balance sheet that normal migration is happening and over time we expect it will come back as those other rates start to match what you can get in the funds steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thanks for taking my question operator and well take our last question from brian foran with autonomous research brian foran q analyst autonomous research hi i guess just quickly on lending it sounds like any underwriting changes on your end are only marginal if i got that comment about focusing liquidity on our best customers right so i just wanted to confirm that and then just more broadly definitely appreciate the point that the rollover in commercial real estate in particular is fairly slow but do you think some of your peers will change underwriting more significantly as people worry about a credit crunch and lending and cre in particular do you think thats a valid concern or do you think thats overblown right now darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so i cant speak to what others will do i think theres a big difference between the banks and the reits and the cmbs and how they underwrite and how theyve underwritten and how they think about things for us in particular we dont move our credit standards very much at all and i think weve talked about this for a while that weve weve had two chief credit officer since our viewpoint on underwriting is pretty consistent and we mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2023 try to be the same through good times and bad right because what our clients value is consistency and knowing what what they need to have in terms of a profile of the loan for us to be there i think for us and the industry as you look at whats maturing theres a question of how many alternative sources of funds are available for those loans particularly in the real estate space and so as loans mature one of the questions will be is there another bank or a fund or someone out there who is ready to take that loan on which obviously will be a function of the debt service coverage and the loantovalue what likely happens though is as prices are challenged in the short term is as youll see some sponsors will have the ability to put in some extra equity which will help with the underwriting you might see some of a noteb note structures you might see some outside private equity money come in in the form of preferred or mezz debt to help with some of those shortfalls so i think whats typical within real estate is its nuanced right its hard to give a blanket statement about what will happen its more clientbyclient and propertybyproperty that you work through these things and so like i said for us we preserve our capital and our liquidity for our best customers and many of these ones particularly in real estate have been around for a long time like were in the second or third generation of supporting them and well continue to do that but theres always opportunity when this kind of disruption occurs and well be paying close attention to that as well brian foran q analyst autonomous research appreciate all of that thank you very much operator and it appears that we have no further questions at this time i will now turn the program back over to brian klock for closing remarks brian klock executive vice president headmarkets and investor relations mt bank corp again thank you all for
