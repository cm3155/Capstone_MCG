capital one financial corp thanks jeff and good afternoon everyone ill start on slide of tonights presentation in the first quarter capital one earned billion or per diluted common share preprovision earnings increased in the quarter to billion and we recorded a provision benefit of million after recognizing million of gains during on our snowflake investment we had a loss on our position in the first quarter of million or per share we have now fully exited our position with a cumulative gain of million turning to slide i will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail in the first quarter we released billion of allowance the release was driven by strong credit performance across all of our businesses and a more favorable economic outlook that includes the trillion stimulus package passed in march capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 our allowance continues to assume that the relationship between economic metrics and credit performance reverts to historical patterns and despite the strong credit performance and more favorable economic outlook we continue to hold significant qualitative factors to account for a number of remaining uncertainties turning to slide ill provide some detail on the allowance coverage by segment after the impact of the billion allowance release our coverage levels declined modestly across all segments from the prior quarter and remain well above prepandemic levels our domestic card coverage is now down from last quarter our branded card coverage is recall that the difference between branded and domestic coverage is driven by the loss sharing agreement in our partnership portfolio coverage in our consumer business declined basis points to and coverage in our commercial banking business fell basis points to moving to slide ill discuss liquidity you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was well above the regulatory requirement our liquidity reserves from cash securities and federal home loan bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately billion the billion increase in total liquidity is largely attributable to strong inflows of consumer and commercial deposits in the last few weeks of the quarter turning to slide ill discuss our net interest margin nim declined basis points in the linked quarter due to a basis point headwind from having two less days in the quarter as well as a higher mix of cash these factors were partially offset by the full quarter effect of deposit pricing actions we took in the fourth quarter and a modest increase in loan yields lastly turning to slide i will cover our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio was at the end of the first quarter up basis points from the fourth quarter and basis points higher than a year ago we continue to estimate that our cet1 capital need is around recall that in january our board of directors authorized a repurchase plan of up to billion of the companys common stock in the first quarter we repurchased million of common stock at an average price of approximately per share based on the feds extension of the trailing fourquarter average earnings rule our share repurchase capacity will be limited to approximately billion in the second quarter the timing and amount of all future stock repurchase activity will be a function of any regulatory restrictions stock trading volumes and our holistic view of our capital position with that i will turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks andrew and its great to have you as our cfo ill begin on slide with our credit card business year overyear credit card loan balances and revenue declined in the first quarter driven by the continuing impacts of the pandemic purchase volume rebounded compared to the first quarter of and the biggest driver of quarterly results was the provision for credit losses which improved significantly credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends which we show on slide for the third consecutive quarter the story of our domestic card business continues to be two sides of the same coin historically high payment rates amplified by the effects of government stimulus continued to put pressure on loan balances and on the flipside the same factors are driving exceptional credit performance capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 looking first at growth we continued to see purchase volume rebound from the sharp declines early in the pandemic domestic card purchase volume for the first quarter was up yearoveryear with growth accelerating in march compared to the first quarter of purchase volume is up most spend categories are now exceeding the prepandemic levels we saw in te spend is still lagging prepandemic levels but its catching up te purchase volume is growing faster than overall purchase volume but payment rates which has risen to a historically high level continues to put pressure on loan balances even with the pickup in consumer spending at the end of the first quarter domestic card ending loan balances were down billion or about year overyear excluding the impact of a partnership portfolio move to heldforsale last year first quarter ending loans declined about yearoveryear the yearoveryear percentage change in ending loan balances this quarter was approximately the same as it was last quarter strikingly strong credit was the biggest driver of domestic card financial results in the quarter just as it has been for the prior two quarters the domestic card chargeoff rate for the quarter was a basis point improvement yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end was basis points better than the prior year first quarter provision for credit losses improved by nearly billion yearoveryear we had a large allowance release in the first quarter of this year versus a large allowance build in the first quarter last year strong credit and purchase volume growth were also key drivers of domestic card revenue margin which was up basis points yearoveryear to total company marketing was up modestly compared to the first quarter of our choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends in the midst of the pandemic were finding opportunities to continue to build the business and we continue to lean into marketing pulling up our domestic card business is delivering significant value and building momentum slide summarizes first quarter results for our consumer banking business auto growth continued strength in retail deposits and exceptional auto credits are the main themes in the first quarter consumer banking results driven by auto first quarter ending loans increased yearoveryear in the consumer banking business average loans grew auto originations were up yearoveryear and up from the linked quarter weve seen competitive intensity increase through the second half of and in the first quarter of and with most competitors holding excess deposits we expect that competitive intensity will continue to increase going forward first quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up billion or yearoveryear average deposits were up on a linked quarter basis ending deposits were up and average deposits were flat elevated consumer savings rates fueled by continuing government stimulus are driving yearoveryear deposit growth first quarter consumer banking revenue increased from the prior year quarter driven by growth in auto loans and retail deposits first quarter provision for credit losses improved by million yearoveryear driven by an allowance release and lower chargeoffs in our auto business credit results in our auto business are strikingly strong and continue to benefit from historically high auction values and government stimulus yearover year the first quarter chargeoff rate improved basis points to and the delinquency rate improved basis points to a sharp uptick in used car values coupled with a stimulusdriven surge in customer payments resulted in a negative net chargeoff rate in march we expect the auto chargeoff rate to increase from its unusually low level as auction prices normalize and stimulus impacts play out the consumer banking business continues to deliver resilient growth in auto loans and retail deposits capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 moving to slide ill discuss our commercial banking business first quarter ending loan balances were down yearoveryear average loans were down in ci weve seen a reduction in commercial line utilization which peaked early in the pandemic as customers facing elevated uncertainty drew down their lines that behavior has since diminished in our commercial real estate business originations were down and paydowns increased compared to the first quarter of quarterly average deposits increased from the first quarter of and from the linked quarter as middle market and government customers continued to hold elevated levels of liquidity first quarter revenue was up from the prior year quarter higher loan and deposit spreads and growth in average deposits were partially offset by lower average loan balances provision for credit losses improved significantly compared to the first quarter of driven by a swing from an allowance build to an allowance release and lower net chargeoffs for the first quarter the commercial banking annualized chargeoff rate was basis points the criticized performing loan rate was and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was our commercial banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to navigate the pandemic and build our commercial capabilities ill close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning three key themes are evident in our first quarter results high payment rates continue to put nearterm pressure on loan balances and revenue growth particularly in our domestic card business on the flipside strikingly strong credit drove a third consecutive quarter of record earnings per share and our investments to transform our technology and transform how we work are paying off our modern technology is powering our response to the pandemic and putting us in a strong position for opportunities that emerge as sweeping digital change transforms banking pulling way up we continue to focus on the things that create enduring value when delivered and sustained over the longterm continuing to transform our technology from the ground up capitalizing on our transformation to drive innovation and growth generating positive operating leverage and improving efficiency over time and managing capital efficiently and effectively including significant planned capital distribution and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp thank you rich well now start the qa session as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup and if you have followup questions after the qa session the investor relations team will be available after the call keith please start the qa capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good evening i want to see if you could talk a little bit about the loan growth outlook perhaps maybe a timing of the inflection just given as stimulus benefits ultimately abate and payment rates peak and i want to see similarly when you would expect to see that peaking of payment rates or at least some inflection there thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks john good evening the growth story is im sure youre mostly focused on card with that question so let me turn there it is really striking that of all the asset classes one really stands sort of unique in the industry is the one asset class that shrank since the start of the pandemic and thats credit card and of course thats because it is a discretionary spending and borrowing product in the current environment the biggest drivers of card growth are spend and payment behavior and of course the traction that were getting in the marketplace lets just talk about spend for a minute which is recovering in the first quarter you saw the domestic card purchase volume was up yearoveryear and were seeing just about every spend category rebounding and even by the way on te while its down its certainly accelerating lets just give you a few stats here te spending at the beginning of the pandemic was down more than and by december it was down about and in march it was down about so from a growth point of view both the growth of purchase volume and loan growth theres some strength that we see on the spending side turning to payment rates which are of course historically high the government stimulus how big a driver is that of whats going on in payment rates obviously consumers have been very conservative as well but its certainly really amplifying the payment rates and i think while not a perfect proxy for our overall domestic card results you can get an idea of whats happening with payment rates in our publicly disclosed trust results for example in march the payment rate in our master trust was just under thats an alltime high for capital one and up more than percentage points yearoveryear now remember that the payment rate represents the percent of the prior months ending balance that was paid off so a payment rate means that nearly half of our beginning balances in the trust were paid off in march which is just remarkable said another way all else equal each percentage point increase in payment rate is a percentage point decrease in yearoveryear growth now we need to always remember and this is a really important point the flipside of high payment rates is strikingly strong credit performance which drives strong profitability and capital generation now the other big driver of growth is what happens with originations and line increases and as the pandemic has played out were seeing some attractive origination opportunities and these opportunities are enhanced by our technology investments and so we are continuing to lean into marketing thats originations capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 we are also gradually increasing credit lines as well so pulling way up we are certainly very pleased with our opportunity to continue to grow our customer franchise the net growth of outstandings will of course be affected by payment rates so here is were not now to your question john were not predicting the timing of an inflection point i think we have certainly learned that high payment rates while they slow down growth are just a really good guide for not only the earnings power of the company but just the performance quality of the consumer we encourage our customers to pay down whenever they can we find every opportunity actually to encourage them and remind them to pay down so i think theres certainly a good thing going on what were focused on from a growth point of view is what we can do to drive the underlying franchise and we like our opportunities there and so were not predicting exact timing of inflection points and things like that what i would leave you with is we like our opportunity on growing the underlying franchise and well see how payment rates play out in terms of driving sort of the final kind of outstandings growth number but to us an underlying growth of the franchise and the really strong dynamics that are going on with on the payment side of the business is just a healthy place to be and we feel really good about that john pancari q analyst evercore group llc thanks rich for all that you told thats helpful just one quick followup on the marketing side i know you indicated that youre still continuing to lean in there the low singledigit growth yearoveryear of marketing expense was better than we had expected can you just possibly give us a way to think about how much of a lean in that youre looking at here incrementally as we look at the remainder of the year thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you john so from a marketing point of view we this first and foremost is going to be powered by what we see on the opportunity to grow originations marketing and originations are really something thats very linked of course outstandings growth is not as closely linked in time or as directly but so we see good opportunities to grow account originations and were investing in marketing consistent with those opportunities in card were certainly in all our businesses were leaning in where we see signs of strength we also are continuing and sort of increasingly so to tell our story in terms of the customer experience were building the some of the benefits of our the technology were building and thats part of our story that gets reflected in the marketing and thats something that powers the growth as well and then were continuing to invest in our brand and our national banking strategy so thats why it kind of pulling way up with the collective set of opportunities were seeing were continuing to lean into the market john pancari q analyst evercore group llc great thank you jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 operator well take our next question from ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening guys maybe to ask about capital so if i look at the target you have over billion of excess youve got billion of reserves above day one and if i look at expectations i think the market is looking for almost billion of earnings in the next few quarters so i wanted to get a sense for how we should think about capital allocation timing of the execution of the billion you previously announced and could we see either upsizing of the current program into the next year or how do we think about the ability to sustain capital returns at these levels thanks andrew young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure ill take that this is andrew the first thing i would highlight is as you know we are still under the capital preservation rules from the fed so in the second quarter as i mentioned in my prepared remarks our repurchase capacity is going to be limited to just under billion and we will also be limited to our prior dividend and so we recognize that capital distribution is important component of our returns and our current position and at least the prospects of earnings from here so how quickly we complete that billion that the board has already authorized is going to tie back to any unforeseen additional regulatory restrictions but also trading volumes in our stock and then just taking a step back and looking holistically at our capital position but what i can say is were excited at the prospect of moving under the scb framework in the third quarter so well have more flexibility in our choices looking ahead operator well take our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks rich you mentioned the strikingly strong credit backdrop im just curious using your analogy of sort of borrowing through the mountain sort of do you think wed get through to the other side with this round of stimulus and maybe ill just ask my followup now andrew maybe you could just give us some sense of how the nim projects for the rest of the year understanding theres different puts and takes maybe you could just walk us through your sort of baseline assumption thank you andrew young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yes sanjay so i think the main factor particularly in the near term with nim is going to depend on the how the pandemic impacts our balance sheet most notably what youve seen over the last few quarters in terms of asset mix and deposit balances and our cash position i think those are the things that are mostly going to have the impact for the next few quarters i think over the longer term id expect our cash position and the size of the investment portfolio to come back down to more normal levels ill call it and be a tailwind to nim all else equal but its again important to know that the uncertainty of what were seeing in deposit volumes and the impact of payment rates as rich said on loan growth those are all factors that are going to create some variability and uncertainty in nim in the nearterm capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp and sanjay with respect to your credit question and the borrowing through the mountain metaphor let me just kind of pull up and give thoughts about whats going on with credit the us consumer continues to demonstrate striking resilient and consumers went into this downturn with like twice the savings rate that they had before the great recession lower payment obligations and none of the structural issues they faced a decade ago with the housing sector and because everything sort of went into vertical a drop at once as the pandemic began they certainly reacted strongly and rationally and launch this trilogy of behaviors of spending less saving more and paying down debt and then of course a year into the pandemic direct government support to consumers including enhanced unemployment benefits remains in place and in fact last month in march was the single largest month of direct government payments to consumers in dollar terms since the pandemic began and the consumer savings rate was in the first two months of more than double what we saw before the pandemic and something like times what it was in the years before the great recession and then we also have the forbearance factor although forbearance is winding down in card and auto it is still relatively widespread for student loans and mortgages and as weve said before the benefits of some of these effects like higher savings are probably cumulative to some extent improving consumer balance sheets in ways that could lead to some sustained credit benefits and now to the metaphor that i know i use all the time every month that the consumer remains healthy were burrowing a longer tunnel underneath the mountain of still high unemployment and were reducing the cumulative losses through this downturn rather than just delaying the impacts now we should all keep in mind a few things here there remains a great deal of uncertainty as you know covid cases remain elevated new variants continue to emerge and while the us has been moving in a pretty good direction of course a lot of the world is moving in the other direction with respect to covid the economy while improving still has a lot of strain elements in it and so that we still look at this just extraordinary kind of paradox of the separation of some of what happened to the economy and what happened to consumer credit but we should all keep in mind the uncertainty that still remains out there and then theres one other point that id just like to put on the table here in the spirit of pattern recognition i do want to flag that this period of unusually strong credit could lay the groundwork for credit worsening down the road as an industry point and let me elaborate on that just for a moment here reliance on consumer credit characteristics that may be more temporary driven by things like stimulus and forbearance can be a real challenge for credit modeling and the benign rearview mirror could encourage lenders to reach for growth and to loosen underwriting standards which as you know can invite adverse selection and then overlay on top of that the excess liquidity and capital thats out there and that could push lenders to stretch for less resilient business so what we have here is a pretty benign period where we are right now were also watching the physics of how markets not only economic markets but how credit markets work and so what were doing at capital one is leaning into the opportunities that we have but by having a view of how the physics of some of these things work were very much watching out for that in all the choices that we make and its again another reason why were focusing as always on making sure that we book resilient business so pulling way up were not ready to predict that the tunnel comes out just all the way across the mountain and we are talking about some topography that can exist out there longer run as a capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 consequence of some of the physics of how the current situation lasts but those are some thoughts on the credit environment sanjay jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc rich can you talk a little bit about what youre seeing on used car values in april weve heard from some competitors that cars are barely on the lot for a day and then what is your strategy on loan growth because competition obviously is picking up across the board yet the returns are still very attractive how are you thinking about that business richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so the don the used car prices are pretty electrifying here auction prices ended the quarter at alltime highs driven by strong demand and persistent constraints on new vehicle supply and over time we still expect auction prices to normalize as these vehicle supply constraints work themselves out but the time horizon for normalization has expanded given the strong recovery of demand and the continuing stress on global supply chains so for example microprocessor shortages have held back new vehicle production for some time the first quarter saw disruptions due to winter weather events and that impacted petrochemical supplies used for parts and then most recently rubber shortages have manifested themselves so the supply shortage there are signs of it everywhere and for example we see rental car companies are normally a source of used vehicle supply but they have very lean fleets at the moment with little excess to sell so we still expect auction prices to normalize over time and a very important thing is in our underwriting we make conservative assumptions with faster normalization now with that very unusual context there and again my view is that we cannot underwrite under an assumption that were going to get the benefit of those things its certainly something were enjoying on our portfolio but as we always do and particularly at this point we need to look past that in our underwriting and thats certainly what were doing with respect to growth industry retail auto sales were strong in the first quarter and especially in march and in addition to tax refund seasonality im sure payments stimulus payments likely really helped strong sales both in the new and the used vehicle segments so at capital one over the course of the pandemic we actually have we tightened up in certain segments especially early on but we are still probably net tighter than we were at the outset were watching things closely but we have benefited by the tide rising for everyone in the industry certainly its been a very exceptional time but also on top of that our investments in industryleading technology products have allowed us to maintain very strong relationships with dealers during these uncertain times and generate the ability to have less in person face toface interaction during the pandemic has also really helped lift the digital products and the digital capabilities that we have both for customers and for dealers capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 so we have found on top of the rising tide maybe a little bit of extra boost at capital one but ive also said that even more so than the card business the auto business is hypersensitive to sort of the level of competition and thats because a dealer sits there and holds an auction in ways that doesnt happen in a directtoconsumer business like card so its not lost on us that the tide rising everywhere in auto has caused quite a buoyancy in the auto business so what were going to do is continue to lean into the opportunities at that moment but again to use my physics term again really keep a watchful eye on the physics of how the markets work and be looking for some of those things that can come on the side of excessive competition as well as over time a breaking of the extraordinary things going on a normalization of the used car prices jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from rick shane jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my questions this afternoon when we look at the noninterest income particularly in the domestic card business it seems to be decoupling and outperforming the increase in spend im curious how much of that is being driven by some sort of release of suppressed fees or how we should be thinking about the catalysts for that andrew young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey rick its andrew the suppression is actually flowing through net interest income so thats not driving it i think the biggest driver if youre looking at it on a margin basis is we are seeing spend volume and interchange spend growing at a faster rate than loans so thats providing a little bit of a tailwind to noninterest income as it relates to overall revenue margin in card richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great that i think that helps but if we look at the yearoveryear increase in spend and we look at the yearoveryear increase in noninterest income theres still a pretty significant gap one of the things thats always a little bit hard to figure out with capital one is where some of the rewards run through is it a function potentially of lower rewards rates given whats going on in the market or is there something else as well andrew young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah i dont think theres a big story there with respect to rewards or interchange rick richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay ill followup offline thank you guys capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 andrew young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp thank you jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks rich i was hoping to go back to the competitive dynamic and maybe a little less from a credit standpoint but you guys have taken some actions recently with respect to your te products just talk a little bit about the rewards environment at your highend consumers and then maybe the things that you did discuss with respect to kind of concerns about the competitive environment and what it kind of how it informs your credit line increase side of the business richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay moshe great questions there lets kind of pull up and talk about card competition competition can show up in a variety of ways including the marketing intensity the product offers including there the upfront bonuses enhanced rewards pricing and other things competitive intensity is back to its high levels particularly as you point to moshe in the rewards space at the higher end the heavy spender end so lets talk about marketing marketing and media spend obviously dropped dramatically in the second quarter and since then activity has steadily increased we get our data on a bit of a lag basis but i feel its very likely that marketing levels are now at or above prepandemic levels the rewards offerings remain intense and lets talk about some of the elements of that upfront bonuses have actually been relatively stable with some modest increases mainly in the travel space and likely in anticipation of returning demand we as for rewards earned on spend weve seen additional categories like groceries and restaurants qualify for enhanced rewards over the past year and while these shifts have slowed down reward levels overall remain high and weve even seen a couple of a few competitors talk about still planning to be tinkering with their rewards here so i think its a very natural thing thats happened with spending having been weighed down and also some of the things moshe that are naturally rewarded are not the activities people tend to be doing that much of right now theres been somewhat of a mix change and i think a forward lean by the industry on this so i think its the things that ive said so often about the card business these days i think its a very competitive industry but theres a rationality to it that im pretty struck by and one that i would not use some of those terms to describe some of the other markets that were in so what are we doing we are continuing to look at our opportunities lean into where we have opportunities i think we feel good with the general structure the rewards products we have but we do know that competition is high and its probably going to be increasing we ourselves are going to lean into marketing and but i dont necessarily see some sort of dramatic changes in the structure of offers out there to change to us the attractiveness of this capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 part of the thing is most of us operate on a relatively thin net margin because while interchange rates are high we are passing most of the interchange rates on to consumers in the form of really attractive deals so pulling way up we continue to like our opportunities we have a lot of years of experience with the high level of intensity and i think we should probably prepare for that moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc and then on the other side of the equation indiscernible richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah sorry moshe yeah so as you know gosh think about the number of years we talked about even before the pandemic probably for months maybe moshe we were talking about kind of pulling back on lines when the we were the recovery was so long in the tooth and we saw some of the things going on in the marketplace so we took a pretty conservative policy with lines and then during the pandemic a particularly conservative strategy with lines and so that contains some potential energy as weve always talked about it turns into kinetic energy when of course we grant the line increases and there is more opportunity for people to spend and the opening of lines has been something weve been doing over the last number of months its been kind of invisible with to the outside world in terms of growth because its getting washed over by the extraordinary payment rates but we continue to see an opportunity to open up some of the lines gradually and moshe i think that represents an extra part of growth opportunity were not doing anything really dramatic but its just part of the gradual leaning into the opportunity with what were seeing with the performance of our customers jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good evening ill ask my questions upfront on efficiency rich can you give us an update on how youre thinking about the strategic significance of your physical branch footprint is there any room for further branch optimization either to fund further investments in the digitization of the business or simply extract greater efficiencies and then also if you could give us an update on the cloud migration that would be great richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay bill so let me start with the branches as you know capital one has over the years sort of leaned into the closing of branches in conjunction with our building of our more national banking business and also the all the digital investments we were making because we spent so much energy on creating an experience that doesnt capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 need to have a branch on every corner and weve been pleased with our strategy so far but theres we dont i think that theres more of a continuation of where we are i think were in continuing to lean into the same strategy weve had for quite a period of time there so i wouldnt look at our network and say wow theres a huge kind of potential to unleash there weve just been gradually making our choices and continuing to develop our digital opportunities watching customer behavior and then just continue down the same path with respect to our cloud strategy as you know we completely exited data centers last year so we are in the cloud and we are enjoying the benefits of being in the public cloud the hassle free access to infrastructure the ability to ride the incredible wave of innovation thats happening on the cloud both from the cloud providers as well as from the rest of the world software companies that are building on the cloud we so this is something weve been many years in the making and were happy to be all in on the cloud but it doesnt mean our journey is done on the cloud we find as we get there theres the opportunity to build many more capabilities the opportunity to really enhance resilience operating resilience failover capabilities efficiency the ability to over time move basically one of the real benefits of the cloud is the ability to abstract the developers from being burdened with the details of the infrastructure that theyre operating on and the cloud itself is an abstractor of that the infrastructure work for a developer but within if you just look at whats happening to cloud the continuing migration sort of abstracting up the tech stack and where cloud has gone with containers and now where its going with serverless just continues to liberate developers so that they can focus on doing what they came to do which is to create great things and ship products now all of that doesnt happen automatically companies have to continue to stay on the forefront so capital one is continuing to invest in the serverless side of the business for example as we continue to move the level of abstraction up the tech stack and create more opportunity for the software to be developed faster more effectively and safer jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i had a couple questions one just rich in thinking about the marketing investment spend and also the opportunity to pick up some new customers i just wanted to understand the kind of timeframe that you think youll be getting that return on investment relative to maybe precovid and im wondering if it might be a longer timeframe to get that return on investment given the stimulus thats in peoples pockets right now or could it be capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 the same because the target market youre going after is not a stimulus receiver just trying to think out loud about how thats going to happen richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp well the first thing to think about marketing always is that marketing while it can influence balance levels marketing is really about growth of a franchise growth of accounts and building brand and those kind of things so i think a way to think about the pandemic is that it took a company like capital one in our card business and just set us back like behind the starting line and thats a pretty jarring thing to happen in our flagship business and our very successful and profitable business but this whole payment phenomenon essentially did that now in that context as we start farther behind the starting line as we look at the opportunity to grow accounts the opportunity to build the franchise the opportunity to get out there with some of our really great digital products and things like this the ability to and of course on the banking side the ability to grow the national bank that is still very that opportunity is still very much there and it isnt really that changed by the pandemic now on the outstanding side you first of all have the paydown story so that definitely is pushing us and others farther back all other things being equal theres sort of the issue for how much credit demand there is that well see from folks we certainly have the spend weakness on the travel side of the business as well so i think that we feel the effectiveness of our marketing in building the franchise is very much like it was before the outstandings metrics of the company started farther behind and they have headwinds to them but since weve always talked about if payment rates stay high were going to have to live with all the great credit performance that we have and the earnings and the ability to distribute capital so the benefits come in a different way but the we are very focused on continuing to build the franchise and i think capital one is in a similar position to do that as we were prepandemic in many ways maybe even a little bit better positioned because were further along on our tech transformation indiscernible operator yeah well take our final question this evening from john hecht with jefferies please go ahead john hecht q analyst jefferies llc afternoon thanks for fitting me in here weve talked about competition quite a bit on this call but maybe an extension to that i guess how does the calculus of competition change with all these neo banks and other kind of digital product platforms competing for firsttime customers does it change anything with respect to the opportunity set richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp john lets talk about that from a couple of perspectives first of all as i often say capital one was one of the original fintechs before anybody used that word so i think fintechs are particularly near and dear to my heart and i watch with tremendous interest at the growth of fintechs that some of the really clever innovation theyre coming up with we should all know of course that all of these fintechs are born in the cloud theyre starting with modern technology and that already gives them a bunch of advantages relative to a lot of banks capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 i think capital one being in the cloud i think is in a sort of much better position competitively relative to that but what we should all favor about the fintech is the modern tech platform they have and thats its always and i think those advantages are larger nowadays than they were in the past because the difference between being built on a modern tech stack versus not is just a greater advantage and something thats motivated us to do very big tech transformation as you know so and the fintechs journey is not just sort of use some clever technology theyre also very much positioning themselves to take advantage of some of the opportunities to gather more data different data than typically gathered and to leverage it in realtime so theres some bunch of impressive things there when we look at the fintechs we are both generally impressed we think that they do represent threats to the business but to us i think they are very much also just a good examples of the kind of innovation thats possible and the kind of innovation that companies like capital one who are in the cloud with on a modern tech stack the kind of things that we can do as well so we look at it from that perspective and were worrying and inspiring at the same time then you have the lending side of business i want to make a special comment about lending half an hour ago i put a caution note out there that weve got a that i worry about where in the marketplace lending goes from here with people building models that are looking at a recession that was very very unusual with sort of spectacular credit and i worry particularly about fintechs who are not that experienced and some of the credit choices they can do and the impacts on our marketplace so i think the fintechs and you can see in the commentary by banks i think banks are becoming a lot more sort of realizing the scale the growth the collective size of the growth rate and the innovation that the fintechs are bringing and theyre going to be a force to reckon with and to us they are a continued impetus that weve got to lean forward weve got to continue on our tech transformation and we need to lead the way ourselves with innovation john hecht q analyst jefferies llc appreciate that thank you richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you jeff
