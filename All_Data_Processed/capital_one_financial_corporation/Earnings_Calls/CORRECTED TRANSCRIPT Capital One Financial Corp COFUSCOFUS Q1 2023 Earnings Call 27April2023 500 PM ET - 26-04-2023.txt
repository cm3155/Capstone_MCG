andrew andrew m young chief financial officer capital one financial corp thanks jeff and good afternoon everyone ill start on slide of tonights presentation in the first quarter capital one earned million or per diluted common share preprovision earnings of billion were flat to the fourth quarter and up relative to the fourth quarter net of adjustments periodend loans held for investment declined and average loans were flat total deposits grew throughout the quarter increasing on average and on an ending basis the increase in deposits was driven by strong retail deposit inflows which was slightly offset by a decline in our commercial deposits capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 our strong retail deposit growth drove our percentage of fdic insured deposits up to end the quarter at of total deposits we have provided additional details on deposit trends on slide in the appendix revenue in the linked quarter decreased primarily driven by lower noninterest income while net interest income was largely flat noninterest expense decreased in the quarter driven by a decline in marketing from the seasonally higher fourth quarter operating expenses were up about on a gaap basis and roughly flat net of the fourth quarter adjusting items provision expense was billion driven by net chargeoffs of billion and an allowance build of billion turning to slide i will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail the billion increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to billion as of march the total company coverage ratio is now up basis points from the prior quarter in our allowance our assumptions for key economic variables remain similar to those of last quarter we continue to assume economic worsening from todays levels on most measures ill cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide in our domestic card business the allowance balance increased by million increasing our coverage ratio by basis points to our build in the quarter was primarily driven by three factors the first factor is the impact of underlying growth in the quarter which replaced seasonal balances from the fourth quarter for which we held minimal allowance the second factor is the impact of removing the relatively lower loss content from the first quarter of and replacing it with higher forecasted loss content for the first quarter of recall that our allowance methodology uses a 12month reasonable and supportable forecast period before it begins to revert to our historical loss average with additional consideration of qualitative factors and finally the third factor in our allowance build was the impact of acquiring the bjs portfolio in the quarter in our consumer banking segment the allowance balance declined by million mostly driven by the decline in loans the coverage ratio increased by basis points and now stands at and finally in our commercial banking business the allowance increased by million the coverage ratio increased by basis points and now stands at the allowance increase was driven by a million reserve build related to our billion commercial office portfolio the coverage on the commercial office portfolio increased about basis points and now stands at we have provided additional details on this portfolio on slide of the presentation turning to page ill now discuss liquidity you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was up from last quarter and a year ago total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased by billion to billion primarily driven by increased levels of cash our cash position ended the quarter at billion up billion from the prior quarter this increase in our cash position was primarily driven by the strong consumer deposit growth i referenced earlier we expect average cash balances in the near term to be elevated relative to prepandemic levels in addition to the higher cash the market value of our afs securities portfolio grew billion to billion at the end of the quarter capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 turning to page ill cover our net interest margin our first quarter net interest margin was basis points lower than last quarter and basis points higher than the year ago quarter the basis point quarterover quarter decline in nim was driven by two factors first basis points of the decline was a result of having two fewer days in the quarter and second the mix impact of the elevated cash balances that i previously described pressured nim by approximately basis points outside of these two effects higher asset yields roughly offset higher funding costs turning to slide i will end by discussing our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio ended the quarter at flat to the prior quarter net income in the quarter and lower riskweighted assets were offset by common and preferred dividends the million of share repurchase we completed in the quarter and a basis point impact from the phasein of the cecl transition at the end of the first quarter the unrealized losses in aoci from our afs investment portfolio were billion if we were to include the impact of these unrealized losses in our regulatory capital our cet1 ratio would have ended the quarter at and we continue to estimate that our longerterm cet1 capital need is around with that i will turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks andrew and good evening everyone ill begin on slide with first quarter results in our credit card business yearoveryear growth in loans and purchase volume drove an increase in revenue compared to the prior year quarter credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on slide in the first quarter strong yearoveryear growth in every topline metric continued in our domestic card business purchase volume for the first quarter was up from the first quarter of ending loan balances increased billion or about yearoveryear and revenue was up yearoveryear driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans revenue margin declined basis points from the prior year quarter and remains strong at revenue margin continues to benefit from growth in the highmargin segments of our card business in the first quarter that benefit was more than offset by two factors first loans are currently growing at a faster rate than purchase volume and net interchange revenue that dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars but a headwind to revenue margin and second as chargeoffs increase were reversing more finance charge and fee revenue both the chargeoff rate and the delinquency rate continued to normalize the domestic card chargeoff rate for the quarter was up basis points yearoveryear to the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased basis points from the prior year to and is now essentially at its march level the chargeoff rate hasnt caught up yet but based on what we see in our delinquencies we think the monthly chargeoff rate will get back to levels around the middle of this year noninterest expense was up from the first quarter of driven by higher operating expense partially offset by a modest yearoveryear decline in marketing capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 total company marketing expense was million in the first quarter our choices in domestic card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing first quarter marketing was down about from the year ago quarter and down about from the fourth quarter of as the first quarter is typically the seasonal low point for domestic card marketing we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our domestic card business our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation and were leaning into marketing to drive resilient growth as always were keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks we are seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in domestic card new accounts purchase volume and loans across our card business and strong momentum and our decadelong focus on heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues slide shows first quarter results for our consumer banking business in the first quarter auto originations declined yearoveryear and from the linked quarter driven by the decline in auto originations consumer banking ending loans decreased billion or yearoveryear on a linkedquarter basis ending loans were down we posted another quarter of strong retail deposit growth first quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up almost billion or yearoveryear and up compared to the sequential quarter average deposits were up yearoveryear and up from the sequential quarter powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities our digitalfirst national direct banking strategy continues to get good traction consumer banking revenue was up yearoveryear driven by deposit growth noninterest expense was up compared to the first quarter of the auto chargeoff rate for the quarter was up basis points yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points yearoveryear compared to the linked quarter the chargeoff rate was down basis points and the 30plus delinquency rate was down basis points the linked quarter trends were consistent with expected seasonal patterns slide shows first quarter results for our commercial banking business compared to the linked quarter first quarter ending loan balances were down and average loans were down the decline is the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit as well as higher customer paydowns in the quarter ending deposits were down from the linked quarter average deposits declined two factors drove the decline we saw normal outflows throughout the first quarter as clients used their cash for payroll tax payments and other business as usual disbursements and consistent with the general trend weve seen for several quarters we also continued to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances first quarter revenue was up from the linked quarter recall that revenue in the prior quarter was unusually low driven by a company neutral move in internal funds transfer pricing excluding this prior quarter impact first quarter commercial revenue would have been down driven by a decline in noninterest income from our capital markets and agency businesses noninterest expense was down from the linked quarter the commercial banking annualized chargeoff rate was basis points criticized loan balances increased primarily in our commercial real estate business the criticized performing loan rate increased basis points from the linked quarter to and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was up basis points from the linked quarter to capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 in closing once again we delivered strong growth in domestic card revenue purchase volume and loans in the first quarter we continue to see opportunities for resilient domestic card growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities and we continue to lean into marketing and as always were closely monitoring and assessing competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty in our consumer banking business loans declined modestly and consumer deposits grew in the quarter our national digitalfirst consumer banking strategy continued to grow and gain traction and were leaning into marketing to grow our consumer deposit franchise in our commercial bank ending loans and deposits were down compared to linked quarter reflecting our cautious stance in the commercial banking marketplace our commercial bank continues to focus on winning through deep industry specialization and across our businesses credit trends continued to normalize in the quarter and we reached or were approaching prepandemic levels at quarter end we continue to expect that the full year annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to and our balance sheet demonstrated its strength through the recent period of turmoil in the banking industry in the first quarter we built additional balance sheet strength as we increased allowance for credit losses grew retail deposits and maintained or increased strong levels of capital and liquidity pulling way up the future of everything in banking is digital and with each passing quarter banking is accelerating toward its inevitable destination capital one is at the vanguard of a very small number of players who are investing to build and leverage a modern technology infrastructure from the bottom of the tech stack up to truly transform technology and put themselves in an advantaged position to win as banking goes digital our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our businesses we are driving improvements in underwriting modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale we are transforming the customer experience in banking and our tech engine drives growth efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth put us in a strong position to deliver compelling longterm shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice president of finance capital one financial corporation thank you rich well now start the qa session remember as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to a single question plus a single followup if you have any follow up questions after the qa session the investor relations team will be available after the call amy please start the qa capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question is from kevin barker with piper sandler your line is open kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to follow up on the reserve build within the card portfolio you said it in the slide presentation worsening credit trends in domestic credit cards but at the same time in your prepared remarks you said that this is more of a normalization than anything else and you continue to grow so what gives you confidence that this reserve build and the fairly rapid increase in delinquency and net chargeoffs is truly a normalization as opposed to signs of further deterioration thats likely to occur thank you richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp kevin thanks for your question there yeah let me just talk about this look i think as things get back to where they were prepandemic at some point the word normalization well need to retire that because things get pretty normal so lets just talk just a little bit about what were seeing and whats inherent in how were in our outlook so at this point many of our credit metrics have returned to their prepandemic levels others have not yet but theyre headed there and weve particularly pointed as probably the best single metric to look at is delinquencies and delinquencies in the first quarter were at which is essentially back to levels now our chargeoffs havent caught up yet but based on what we see in our delinquencies we think theyll get back to levels around the middle of the year and our credit metrics tend to move what ive seen just over the many years probably a quarter or two ahead of the industry in both directions we saw that in the global financial crisis and we saw it again in the pandemic and were probably seeing it again here so first of all just relative to our outlook and how we think about in terms of forecasting our losses going forward there is one effect thats more of a capital one effect its an effect that exists for everyone i think its more pronounced for capital one relative to our loss rates which is related to recovery so let me just pause and explain that one for a minute past chargeoffs are of course the raw material for future recoveries and we just lived through three years of very low chargeoffs so our recoveries will be unusually low in the short to medium term this is a larger headwind for us than most others because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average and because we tend to work most of our recoveries we tend to work them on our own as opposed to selling them so the recoveries come in over time and not all at once as would be the case in a debt sale so thats just a capital one effect that weve been talking about for a while and that is inherent in sort of the math of how our chargeoffs are working and will work over time the other effect is the economy and we are assuming material worsening of labor markets with the unemployment rate rising from todays very low levels to above by the end of we are also assuming adverse effects from inflation and some further worsening of consumer profiles from the sort of the flip side of their extraordinary outperformance in the earlier period during the pandemic capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 so thats just a comment about how we create outlooks we continue to feel very good about the business we are leaning into our growth opportunities our originations are coming in consistently solid and we like the opportunities we see out there we underwrite we always have underwritten for worsening scenario so as the economy and sort of as credit performance normalizes which weve expected for a long period of time we are just continuing right on the path we have been on for quite some time every quarter we trim a little bit around the edges where we see or where we anticipate an effect where customers might be a little bit more vulnerable were also struck by the continued expansion of opportunities that are very resilient and were leaning into those so we this business is built to anticipate volatility in losses and higher loss rates and what were doing is consistent with things that we have expected and we continue to really feel good about the opportunities kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay and then in the past youve made comments that the new growth the flow rates were relatively normal on a lot of your newer business do you continue to see that and then also in the near term are you still seeing the type of traction from your marketing spend i guess in the first quarter as you did in richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah so on your question about flow rates let me just why dont i just seize the moment a little bit and just talk about a bunch of our credit metrics and where they are so weve talked about delinquencies weve talked about losses our individual flow rates have normalized and if we look at very early entry flow rates and a couple of delinquency buckets in some cases theyre just a tick higher than they were in the way back at levels but things are basically back our payment rates have payment rates are a striking thing because you saw just the electrifying well saw if you look at the trust data the electrifying increase the whole industrys flow rates increased pretty dramatically capital ones increased the most and that was a striking in fact driven really by two different things one is the flip side of the or a manifestation of the extraordinary credit performance of the consumer where they just were in such a good position they just were paying the card off at high levels and it was also a manifestation of the continuing mix shift towards the top of the market and the traction we were getting in heavy spenders so payment rates have declined from the very high levels theyre not even close to where they were originally but because of these two effects if we separate them out and sort of look segment by segment we see that payment rates are declining in every segment but not yet back to where they were prepandemic so thats something to keep an eye on there our revolve rate is roughly flat to last year and remains below prepandemic levels but i think again theres a growth in transacting balances effect there so well have to sort of adjust for that and then a very important one is new originations lets talk about that so we see early performance that is consistent with our expectations the earliest delinquencies so we of course look very carefully at the early delinquencies on our most recent vintages that would be some months ago because they have to have a few months where we can start reading them but the earliest delinquencies on our newest monthly vintages of origination are consistent with prepandemic originations as we compare one segment at a time on current originations versus several years ago capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 and then vintageovervintage monthovermonth for recent vintages were seeing pretty stable risk levels so we feel very good about that one thing that ive commented on over time is we have continued to in anticipation of market changes trim a little bit around the edges so that our the fact that our originations are performing on top of sort of where they were several years ago is also the result of some active anticipatory management and so probably it offset some underlying worsening thats happened in the marketplace so if we pull up on that set of metrics we continue to feel very good about the choices were making as i said before this is puts us in a position to continue to lean into the marketing we in our originations anticipate worsening as just a matter of underwriting anyway and so were leaning into the marketing even as we continue to trim a little bit around the edges here or there and so in some ways our message here is just very very similar with the feel of how this has been for really quite a few quarters now jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corporation next question please operator one moment please next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good evening richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey betsy andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so just want to make sure i understand on the reserve ratio i know we already spoke a lot about it so i just want to make sure i understand you just say yes or no is it fair to assume that the reserve ratio should go up every quarter where the macro stays in the current situation that weve got right now because the book thats rolling on is worse quality than the book thats rolling off is that fair andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp i dont want to limit myself to a yes or no betsy given the framing of your question the short answer is no and i will spare you from the allowance tutorial answer that i provided a quarter ago but really the mechanics are we have assumed for the losses or reserved for the losses that based on the current balances that were on the books at the end of the quarter what we assume we will experience over the next months and so if youre just capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 replacing loan for loan with similar characteristics you wouldnt otherwise have a build if im getting if im interpreting the nature of your question correctly betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then the followup question is just on a slightly different topic which has to do with the expense ratio i know you mentioned that youre looking for the operating efficiency to be flat to down this year on a yearonyear basis im just wondering how to square that with what you mentioned on the marketing side where it sounds like you see a lot of opportunities in card and you are planning on leaning into the marketing side so i just wanted to square those two things up andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp well betsy let me just clarify and then ill turn it over to rich when our guidance for efficiency relates to operating expenses it is not a total efficiency point and so it would exclude whatever choices we make in marketing from that calculation but ill turn it to rich to respond to the broader question richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah well i was going to say the same thing so our guidance is with respect to operating efficiency ratio to be flat to modestly down relative to and we continue to put a lot of energy into that of course the total efficiency ratio includes also the marketing side of the business as weve talked about thats not part of our specific guidance our marketing choices are very dependent on the opportunity that we see and betsy you and most of the people on this call have known capital one for a long time and when we see opportunities we really lean in on them and so we can talk about marketing maybe on another question but thats the efficiency point there jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corporation next question please operator our next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch with credit suisse your line is open moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks good evening rich you had mentioned that you expected the card chargeoffs to kind of reach levels by the middle of the year you also talked a little bit about assuming higher unemployment over time i guess what should we think about as the trajectory i guess in other words is a stopping point or is if your expected unemployment levels are reached then we would expect to see those losses go up even higher richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so moshe just with respect to unemployment rate i want to make a comment on that all companies including capital one try to look into limited historical data and the thing i often call trying to model on two humps of the camel because its only been a small number of times in the history of the card business that various economic capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 metrics have gone up and gone down so limited to the camel hump point we all do our best to try to look at the drivers of and the correlations with respect to credit losses a striking thing all along in our journey has been the sort of parallel movement of unemployment rates and credit losses so the it turns out from a modeling point of view while often in the standard way people talk about things is to focus on the level of unemployment in many of our models actually the rate of change is what matters most either as a measure like monthly job creation or is the change to the unemployment rate so an increase in the unemployment rate from the to the is pretty material worsening but thats more of a window into the well we would be cautious about even though historically card losses almost strikingly to the number of average industry card losses theyve been pretty close to the unemployment rate over those two humps of a camel in the past but i think that i think we lean a little harder into the effects that happened when unemployment rate changes and therefore that just happens to be a bigger element in our own models i do want to just make a couple of other points just intuitive points about the economy so we start with a consumer thats in a very strong place we know that and the consumer excess savings on average is of course winding down but its still there but of course credit losses play out at the margin not just on average but there are just a couple of effects that none of us will know until sort of after the fact well one of the two im going to talk about will never know but i just want to comment on those because those affect our outlook of where credit losses can be one of course is inflation and none of us really have historical data in the card business to understand or predict the effects of significant increases and levels of inflation but we are expecting inflation to impact consumer credit by compressing real incomes and as kind of a separate effect from an unemployment effect and we since we havent seen sustained inflation for more than years we cant really model this effect directly but we make informed assumptions in our outlook to sort of account for this effect so for example a way to think about this is if there is a decline in real incomes that happens with this we can look at our history and our crosssectional evaluation of how people do as a function of different income levels and then we can sort of extrapolate from those credit effects and proxy how something like inflation can have an effect there so its sort of using proxies but it matches off to an intuitive assumption that high levels of inflation are going to be challenging for people and finally the other effect is as i intuitively think about the marketplace over all the years of sort of my journey in this weve tended to see that periods of abnormally good credit are followed by periods of worse credit and vice versa and the credit performance we saw over the past three years was unprecedented so theres what maybe we could call a catchingup effect that happens on the other side of that for consumers who might otherwise have charged off over the past three years and sort of the reverse of this effect happened in the global financial crisis where chargeoffs were accelerated and then it was kind of followed by a period of strikingly benign credit this is an effect i intuitively believe we cant measure it we wont even in hindsight be able to measure it but i just think its part of the intuition that we bring into the business so when we pull kind of way up on things we share with you the credit metrics that we see and pretty much what you see is all that we see so now were all in the business of saying where does this go from here i shared with you some intuitive views that would lead to higher chargeoff levels over time and when we look at those when we look at our card how we underwrite in card we both can believe effects like this are will happen over time and also how strong the opportunity in card continues to be capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 so thats just a little window into how we think about that and then thats sort of me talking but then of course andrew leads the whole process relative to and our head of credit a whole process relative to the allowance build but anyway those are some thoughts about credit and how the kind of factors that may play out over time moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks rich maybe just switching gears a little bit you mentioned the capital ratio and then the capital ratio if the aoci were excluded or included when you think about capital return over the next year which one of those are you using as your base andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yes moshe its andrew we look at a number of things as we are considering our capital actions and so ive been saying for a couple of quarters now weve seen an increased level of uncertainty in the economic environment wide ranges around growth opportunities and everything thats happened over the last months has increased that level of uncertainty and so we continue to believe that its prudent to operate above our longterm target both until we have more clarity not only on the economic front but to the potential regulatory changes that may be coming down the pike which could very well include treatment of aoci in capital but of course we dont know that yet and so for now were continuing to operate above that longterm target but suffice it to say we have substantial capital generation capacity and we regularly evaluate our plans in light of the economic changes in light of regulatory changes we have the ability to pivot quickly in our deployment and certainly well do so when we feel like the time is right jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corporation next question please operator our next question comes from richard shane with jpmorgan your line is open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my questions hey andrew id like to talk a little bit about the impact of the surge in deposits when we look at the impact it appears that it primarily runs through the corporate and other line in terms of where the nim impact is but the other change that i think we see is that it looks like the transfer pricing on deposits went down modestly when we think about things going forward should we assume that theres a continued drag at the corporate line from the elevated deposits and that because the reinvestment rate is lower that the transfer pricing is going to be a little bit lower as well andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 well rick let me just clarify first and im assuming youre just looking at the net interest income trends in other which does serve as a clearinghouse for ftps but im happy to talk to you offline in more detail about this but the basic tenets of the ftp process or theres an arms length transaction between corporateother and deposits and so theyre getting a prevailing rate which shows up in the revenue of either the consumer banking segment or the commercial banking segment and so there isnt a subsidy or drag going on there theres just a number of other clearing factors that happen in other richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc understood but actually weve figured out a way over the years to calculate the nii on the transferred deposits through the consumer bank and it looks like they were down and its been very accurate over a long time it looks like the transfer deposit rate was down about basis points so at the consumer bank so im curious it looks like there was a drag in terms of corporate and other and actually the benefit at the bank was a little bit less attractive from an nii perspective as well jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corporation hey rick its jeff i dont think we can comment on a calculation that youre doing that we dont fully understand why dont you and i take that offline richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay terrific thank you guys richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks richard rick jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corporation next question please next question please operator our next question comes from arren cyganovich with citi your line is open arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks maybe talk a little bit about credit card purchase volumes looks like they inched up a little bit during the quarter weve heard that from others that theyre seeing slowdown in purchase volume in march and into april what are you seeing within your portfolio and are there any differences between different income demographics that youre seeing within your customers richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so arren yes thank you lets just talk about purchase volume so in  our card purchase volume was up yearoveryear and this growth while its very solid has decreased from the first part of but i think its capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 striking to separate out spend per active account and then like the growth of accounts and some of the benefits of our recent origination efforts so if we look at spend per active account now it was sort of it just really surged from the doldrums of the deep pandemic then it really surged into the levels it was a year ago we see spend per active account is pretty flat to a year ago and it is and we can watch it on a i mean typically over the last few months it has been sort of declining on that coming down to basically a sort of net result of being flat for a year ago or i think maybe its actually in the last couple of months a little bit under where it was a year ago if i remember the graph that i was looking at now initially its a funny thing how so often we see effects that start on the lower income lower credit score side and then make their way up i mean pretty much the whole way credit has played out both on the improving side in the pandemic and then on the normalizing side thats happened but on spend this slowing down happened in lower income segments first but now its more broadbased across income bands and really segments of our card business so we of course are having very nice growth in accounts and thats continuing to power purchase volume even as the spend sort of levels out now in the spirit of what are we rooting for it seems to me to be a pretty rational thing for consumers to sort of level off this pretty strong spend that they have had so i think what we see were pretty pleased with and then we look at things like discretionary and nondiscretionary spending both of them have slowed significantly over the last year well no the growth rates have slowed significantly but the category mix of spend the more things change the more they stay the same because basically pretty much across all the categories things have returned to the prepandemic level arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks and just following up i appreciate the commercial office mix disclosures you put in your slide deck it looks relatively small comparative to the overall commercial and overall loan portfolio total together maybe you could just talk a little bit about your commercial real estate business is this i know you acquired several kind of smaller banks north fork and hibernia and chevy chase are these predominantly portfolios from around those regions or do you also have a national lending business that deals in larger commercial real estate as well andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yes let me start by talking about kind of what isnt in the disclosure that we provided because i know theres differences across various organizations as you know arren that its a little less than billion and represents about of our total loans but this is our commercial office space it is excluding as you probably saw in the footnote your medical office and reit and reif medical office just has very different characteristics and so too does reit and reif so in terms of the commercial office portfolio on our books its roughly twothirds concentrated in new york dc and san francisco it is roughly bc and obviously class a and so it has been accumulated over time but it also was a business that up until a few years ago we were active in but we havent had any new originations for the past few quarters reduced our exposure to this segment over the past year by a little north of i think its capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 but given right now just the uncertainty that we see with office vacancies being elevated and utilization rates significantly below prepandemic levels and increasing debt service burdens despite the fact that we are getting payment on principal and interest just in light of the continued uncertainty that i described just in terms of utilization and other factors we decided to increase the coverage ratio quite a bit this quarter and thats what you see in the disclosure in the back jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corporation next question please operator our next question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs your line is open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening everyone richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp hi ryan andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc maybe i know there has been a lot of questions on credit but maybe just to follow up on another one rich so can you maybe just talk about where the credit performance was worse or where it deteriorated and also im surprised by the comment that youre reaching normal levels despite continued elevated payment rates and lower revolve rate so how do you think about from here balancing growth versus the risk of credit continuing to not only normalize but get worse richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so yes ryan i think the best net impression despite the fact that when we look at all our credit metrics some of them like half of them arent sort of back to prepandemic levels and half of them are my gut feel is its a better net impression to view them as back and i just think the underlying effects of continuing to lean into spenders not only at the very top of the market but within our segments and just the emphasis that we put on spend in some of the products the marketing the way we manage accounts the kind of the people we raise lines to et cetera i just think theres been a subtle shift a little more towards the spending side so i think that might explain why a few of these metrics are behind but behind in terms of the but i think i walk around with the perception that things are pretty much at the levels of where they were a few years ago so now we feel very comfortable with respect to the choices that were making and lets just talk about why that is ive already said we underwrite to assumed worsening so lets go back to back when the behavior of the capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 consumer was at levels we never seen in the whole history of the company the credit performance was so good we just assumed that was unsustainable we underwrote to much higher levels of losses so as things normalize thats not really sort of changing anything at capital one so we but at the same time you see the noise all over the place on the horizon so we obsessively look for we not only use all of our modern and machine learningbased monitoring tools to identify little pockets that might be gapping out from expected performance or prior performance or anything like that and by the way we have seen that in some pockets and then we dialed that back we also hunt around and think about where would most intuitively the vulnerabilities be to where the economy is going and we even anticipatorily kind of dial back around the edges there but as i said earlier im kind of struck by the number of new opportunities that are originating in terms of driven by the tech transformation of the company new channels new ways to succeed with customers that for kind of for every dial back thats happened weve seemed to have had opportunities open up and so we lean into those and so it leads to my sitting in here and saying with respect to the card business we feel and i want you to walk away with that same net impression the same level of optimism about our growth opportunities and our marketing and really the opportunity to create value in this part of the where we are in the cycle with card to be very strong now even as that happens just to its always striking to talk about the fact that the sibling of the card business which is our auto business has been in a striking pullback mode over the very same period that weve been leaning in here and i partly point that out just to say that we dont at the top of the house say theres just a green light out there this is all very much one part of the business at a time one segment one business area but that pullback in auto has been a minority of the pullback but still an important part of the pullback has been credit driven in the sense of looking at things in the card business and trying to get ahead of any effects that we think might happen from a credit point of view but the majority of the effects have been margin related as weve talked about with the some of the marketplace not passing through into their pricing the higher interest rates and so we have dialed back quite a bit in auto but given that most of that dial back or certainly the majority of it is really more margin related and not so much credit related if things change and normalize a little bit more on the pricing side we might be able to open up more opportunity in auto but what im pleased about is the combination of the walking around with intuitive model about how the marketplace works and as i shared in the earlier answer thinking about the ways customers credit can worsen and customers can do perform not as well as it might appear as we obsess about that that informs our choices and then by monitoring at the margin and incredibly granularly to look for effects and then having the technology to move so quickly with respect to the identification the diagnosis of whats going on the root causes of it and then taking the action which is a cycle thats way faster than it used to be before our tech transformation all of these contribute to the ability to be able to move with confidence in a changing environment and probably has contributed to why the vintage curves sort of keep coming back coming in on top of each other despite a changing environment and all of that finally leads to why we feel confident about our opportunities to lean into growth because every opportunity has a limited window and were the company that when we see those opportunities we go after them capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it appreciate the color ill step back from the queue richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks ryan jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corporation next question please operator our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research your line is open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good evening rich and andrew as a followup for you andrew on your allowance commentary just to make sure i have the mechanics right if macro conditions do indeed worsen from here as you expect and each new quarter that comes on reflects a worse outlook than each old quarter that rolls off is it reasonable to expect that your reserve rate would drift higher in future quarters given that dynamic andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp it would bill i was responding to what i interpreted to the betsys question of just individual vintages being the same similar to what rich just described that in and of itself if you have a consistent growth rate wouldnt add to allowance but if were updating our assumptions a quarter from now and our economic view changes that will likely change our estimation of the lost content of the portfolio at that time bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats super helpful thank you and then separately rich i wanted to ask you about the cfpb late fee proposal we know its less significant for you than it is for others who are more deeply involved in the partnership business but as we try to think through how this may play out across the industry can you give any perspective on the extent to which youd expect some merchants to possibly push back against efforts by their issuing partners to renegotiate economic terms following the proposed reduction in late fees particularly in cases where merchants expect their sales to come under pressure richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so bill i dont really have a prediction about what exactly happens in the partnership business relative to merchant partnership agreements and then something as significant as the changes in late fees come and therefore what do the collective the merchant and the issuer sort of do about that i dont really have a prediction on that one capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 i just i wouldnt want to let your opening comment go just when you say well its obviously much more probably for the people with partnerships than others because this were this legislation to come into effect it has a significant impact on capital one so now theres a lot of miles to go before maybe everything works out but just to comment on this for a second first of all with respect to the proposal its not final and we the cfpbs will get lots of public comments and well have to see how the rulemaking process plays out late fees play in very important role in the system because they provide a direct and clear incentive for customers to pay on time and avoid running into delinquency and its also a way that issuers can sort of price for risk and all this leads to greater access to credit and lower cost of credit on average so we certainly have a point of view on this one a change in a significant change in late fees could affect consumer payment behavior and delinquencies it could affect access to certain parts of the population so theres kind of a lot at stake but what i wanted to say for capital one this is its an important revenue source for capital one and we obviously are working on thinking about those impacts what might be mitigating measures and so were early into our thinking about it but i think not only for partnershipbased companies but for capital one and maybe some other players as well this is an important development that were going to all have to take very seriously jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corporation next question please operator our next question comes from john hecht with jefferies your line is open john hecht q analyst jefferies llc good afternoon guys actually all my questions have been asked and answered but something came up to me and rich i apologize if its somewhat nebulous but in the past youve given us some good metaphors to think about the environment i think during the pandemic and stimulus zone you talked about it youre boring through a mountain because of stimulus which helped avoid some level of loss content were in this unique world where we have inflation many of us havent really lived or at least analyzed the equity markets in a period like this and then weve got a lot of other factors going on as well both good and bad im wondering whether its a metaphor or not you stepping back how do you describe the overall environment youre advancing in certain categories pulling back in others is there some context you can give us or a comparison to a previous time or how you think about it in comparison to previous time richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp well thank you john i had forgotten all about i know youve been around me for quite a while i love metaphors and sometimes metaphors i think can be pretty striking ways to think about things that otherwise are complex to talk about but going back to the boring through the mountain remember we were talking back then each quarter wed say well were in what could be very whopping losses that come from the tremendous upheaval of the pandemic every quarter we are boring through the mountain and with the government stimulus and so on if we think back capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 we got all the way through the mountain to the other side and it was better from a credit point of view than anything that we can kind of imagine so if i pull up and just say where am i just how do i feel about where we are when i think about the health of the consumer the us consumer remains a source of relative strength in an uncertain economy the savings accumulated over the pandemic remain a positive for many consumers that servicing burdens remain low by historical standards the labor market which is usually the most important economic driver of consumer credit performance remains strikingly strong although we have seen some indications of some softening now on the other hand home prices have been falling a little bit inflation i really believe none of us know really the effects of inflation so were going to be needing to manage intuitively here we cant pull out phds to figure this one out so we assume the inflation is going to heres an interesting thought on inflation versus unemployment john unemployment affects a small number of people terribly inflation affects all of us somewhat and so from a credit point of view i believe the reason unemployment has been the biggest driver is that because chargeoffs happen at the tail of the distribution and the tail moves when the economy moves so what is the effect of all of us losing a little bit of our purchasing power my gut feel is its just something that is slow in its effect its cumulative it doesnt have the sort of precipitous effects that the unemployment does but i still believe on little cat feet theres another metaphor for you john i think it will play out the other one and its almost i want to go back and i dont have a perfect metaphor for it but i do want to say again ive been around this business long enough to kind of know that extreme effects with respect to credit for a period of time create the opposite effect on the other side just it does with respect to markets and competition but thats not even what im talking about here i believe in life lets just say theres always a certain percentage of consumers that are living on the edge theyre vulnerable and they dont have much of a buffer to absorb shock so then when the global financial crisis came along it was like a tsunami wave coming in and everyone who was i feel just so many people that were in a somewhat vulnerable situation got sort of washed over from that that it was followed by this period where we had trouble keeping up with our own forecast of the losses in a good way in the sense that we finally said this is the survivorship effect the great recession accelerated so many chargeoffs that at some point were statistically probably going to happen that we had a survivorship effect going on that anybody could survive that probably not charging off anytime soon and thats why you sort of had therefore the reverse of that effect and i believe intuitively i have no way to prove it and well never be able to quantify it but just intuitively thinking about it there were still vulnerable people all during the period of the pandemic so many of them got lifelines that i think you can it doesnt mean there are lives necessarily changed and i think you have sort of the reverse survivorship effect or maybe the sort of the catchingup effect from very very low losses and this is something that i believe is a real effect and so if i pull up i think the consumer is in a great shape youre going to have sort of on little cat feet the inflation effect and the catchingup effect and then you have a wildcard of a quite uncertain economy that creates greater volatility than usual in terms of where things might go capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 but in the context of all of that and the opportunities we see one of the thing sorry its a long answer to your question but one of the things that you may remember my saying back when the credit was just unsustainably good a couple of years ago i remember saying that there will be real consequences in the competitive marketplace if this abnormal environment continues for too long and we really already saw it happen in the period of the extraordinary credit what you saw is a tremendous inflow of fintechs you saw a huge expansion of credit primarily in the subprime and even below sort of where we play in that space we were worried that the underwriting that any of them were doing would be its based on data would definitionally not have a rearview it would have a rearview mirror that is extremely unreliable so i think i will pull back this sort of great normalization thats happening even with some cat feet effects that are still probably going to play out is a very healthy thing to happen in terms of credit environments competitive environments and the marketplace over time so allinall i feel really good about where we are and if you detect optimism in my voice youre getting the right read there jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corporation next question please john hecht q analyst jefferies llc very helpful appreciate that richard jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corporation next question please operator one moment please our next question comes from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer your line is open dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc hey thanks so much for taking my questions almost to piggyback on that last question a little bit there have been a lot of new card issuers and types of cards and payment types like p2p debit rewards fednow is coming out could you talk about the evolving of both debit and credit card space and how you expect the competition and offerings could change over time not just versus lets say discover synchrony or american express but other payment types and how capital one is positioned as payment preferences among consumers might change thanks richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes well weve seen a lot of innovation over the last number of years id add one to your list one that really was quite a made quite a splash which is buy now pay later that came into the marketplace let me really sort of start with that one when buy now pay later came out i remember having sort of saying this is kind of ironic because the original and still extraordinary buy now pay later product is called the credit card capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 so what is this new one that says you can buy now and pay later but anyway it was riding on the back of some very clever technology sort of modern tech stacks and really good merchant relationships that made quite an impact on there now it was hailed as a revolution in payments from everything that we saw early on i think it was by the way a very clever payment a very clever innovation but it turned out to be more of a credit access play than necessarily im not saying it isnt a revolution well im saying that when we look at who flock there it was a credit from looking at our bank customers and card customers everything else it was a credit access play and i think its running into some challenges with respect to merchant discount rates and some credit challenges and other things but it was certainly quite innovation if you look at debit cards anyone innovating in the debit card space that has access to the differential interchange that came from the law that created tried to advantage smaller players versus bigger and networks other than well different choices for different networks and differentsized players anyone who has the fortune to ride on the back of that i think thats a promising opportunity for them and the payment space will continue to evolve one other thing about payments that when you look pull way up and say in what areas have fintechs or major tech companies have the biggest impact on banking we of course worried that all aspects of banking would get affected the biggest i think the biggest single area that has really been impacted is payments itself which when you think about it its kind of the holy grail from a tech companys point of view because its where the money is and its a realtime kind of customer experience activity and importantly its not heavily regulated for what its worth the other play that i think the tech companies enduringly have had the greatest impact is in the platforms space either payments platforms or other kind of platforms building on modern tech stack so those are some thoughts in the marketplace so just a reminder capital one has got to stay on the forefront of innovation or we can be yesterdays news jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corporation next question please operator our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you ive got some followup questions for andrew on some of the comments maybe just first on the basis points drag from the excess cash does that persist over the course of the year or does that go away at some point andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp well as i said in my talking points sanjay i think that is something that we do expect to remain at least elevated compared to prepandemic levels so yeah i would thats probably where i would leave that sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 okay and then secondly just the comments on capital levels and capital return should we assume like youre going to maintain cet1 inclusive of sort of aoci or work your way up to that level and then consider any moves with capital return or maybe you could just help us think through how we should read into some of your comments there and then at what rate does aoci accrete over the course of the year i just would love to get some color on that thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yes why dont i start with the second one first which is if you look at our afs aoci about of that will pull to par between now and the end of in terms of capital targets i absolutely would not say its a mechanical linkage that we are thinking about our capital targets inclusive of aoci theres a lot of uncertainty of regulatory treatment it is not included in our regulatory ratios at this point i just referenced that that is one thing that we look at in addition to a number of other factors inclusive of just economic uncertainty and our growth opportunities and so for now weve been operating above our target were going to keep an eye on those things and as we have more certainty of the future we have a lot of flexibility with how we return capital to shareholders if thats appropriate jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corporation next question please operator our final question comes from john pancari with evercore esi sic evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good evening on the net interest margin front i wanted to see if you could possibly give us some color on how you see the margin trajectory here from the level just given what you said about cash balances likely to remain elevated and then maybe how deposit pricing plays into that and how youre thinking about through cycle deposit beta at this point thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hi well ill go in reverse order on that one too because the beta will feed into the nim response there ill remind you of my comments from a quarter ago where i talked about cumulative deposit beta for the overall company could be somewhat higher than the last rate cycle which was i think a quarter ago our cumulative beta was in the mid where we sit today its it is hard to predict how much further deposit betas will increase from here theres a number of unique factors especially following the events of the last month that makes predicting betas a challenge everything from product mix to the market in competitive pricing if theres really intense competition for more insured deposits and just the sheer magnitude and pace of fed fund hikes is unprecedented and what happens to on the other side when the fed eventually starts lowering rates and all of this is happening in the context of a fed thats executing qt capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 so where we go from here is going to be impacted by a number of factors customers appetite for different deposit products our focus on customer relationships industry competition funding needs but i will say given deposit pricing tends to lag asset yield resets i wouldnt be surprised if theres at least some upward pressure on beta from where we were in the first quarter so as i then pull that into thinking about nim over time that is likely a potential headwind for us particularly in the near term given the lag of deposit pricing where wholesale funding costs go could also be a headwind and as credit continues to normalize we could continue to see revenue suppression so those are a few things that will potentially provide a headwind to nim from where we sit today but on the other hand theres definitely some tailwinds even though my response to sanjays question in the real near term i would think our average cash position will stay elevated relative to prepandemic levels not necessarily relative to what we saw in the first quarter but over a longer period of time that will almost assuredly come back down and eventually be a tailwind for nim we also could see a growing percentage of revolving card balances and in the immediate term keep in mind well have one more day in the second quarter so i know that thats a lot of headwinds and tailwinds but just wanted to give you a sense of all of the forces at play there john pancari q analyst evercore isi no thank you thats very helpful and then just secondly weve seen some headlines regarding the walmart partnership and i dont know if you can provide a little bit of color there on where that stands maybe can you confirm the discussions the timing of when any change could be and then lastly if you can update us on any other upcoming negotiations or maturities of other types of partnerships on that front thanks richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay thank you john so we are of course in the middle of litigation so theres only so much im going to share in an earnings call about the various legal arguments being made by each side but at a high level walmart has sued us trying to terminate the deal early and we deny that they have a contractual right to an early termination walmart points to some service failures that we cured in and which had no impact on the value of the portfolio now in the meantime we are committed to meeting our contractual commitments while we defend ourselves in court and we will keep you updated on the litigation in our periodic sec filings with respect to timing of any potential impacts there are a lot of unknowns theres the of course the question of whether walmart will win their litigation seeking early termination and if so when that will occur we of course deny that they have a right to terminate early then theres a question of how long it will take for walmart to transfer the portfolio to a new issuer we currently expect that the transfer of the walmart portfolio to a new issuer would occur no earlier than january even if they win their litigation so we will keep you updated if our timing expectation changes capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 jeff norris senior vice president of finance capital one financial corporation well that concludes the earnings call for this evening thank you for joining us on this conference call and thank you for your interest in
