financial corp thanks danielle and good afternoon everyone ill start on slide of tonights presentation in the second quarter capital one earned billion or per diluted common share on a linked quarter basis periodend loans held for investment grew and average loans grew driven by growth across all of our segments revenue in the linked quarter increased or after accounting for the million gain on sale recognized in the prior quarter noninterest expense grew in the quarter driven by an increase in marketing which was partially offset by lower operating expenses provision expense in the quarter was billion driven mostly by net chargeoffs of million and a million allowance build capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 turning to slide i will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail the total companys million allowance build in the quarter brings our allowance balance up to billion as of june our total company coverage ratio decreased basis points to the changes in allowance and coverage ratio varied by segment which ill cover on slide across all our businesses loan growth and a worsening economic outlook drove upward pressure on allowance in our consumer banking segment the allowance balance increased by million the coverage in consumer banking increased basis points to in our commercial banking business the allowance increased by million the coverage in commercial banking increased basis points and now stands at in addition to the allowance build there was also million of provision related to unfunded lending commitments in our domestic card business we released million of allowance despite the effects of the growth and worsening economic outlook i previously mentioned we have seen some signs of gradual normalization in our card credit metrics but so far the pace of that normalization has been slower than what we assumed when we set last quarters allowance the impact of this slower than assumed normalization more than offset the growth and worsening economic outlook leading to the allowance release we continue to carry elevated levels of qualitative reserves for downside risks related to economic uncertainty the coverage ratio for domestic card now stands at turning to page ill discuss liquidity you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was well above the regulatory requirement total liquidity reserves declined billion in the quarter as our liquidity normalizes towards prepandemic levels cash and cash equivalents declined about billion and now stands at billion we also had a billion decline in our securities portfolio driven by the combination of the mark from rising interest rates and the continued runoff of the outsized portfolio built during the pandemic turning to page ill cover our net interest margin net interest income in the quarter was billion up from the yearago quarter and up from the sequential quarter our second quarter net interest margin was basis points higher than the yearago quarter and basis points higher than the prior quarter relative to a year ago the increase in nim is largely driven by a balance sheet shift as we continued to deploy excess cash and securities into loan growth the linked quarter increase in nim was driven by an additional day to recognize revenue higher yields on assets in the quarter were offset by higher wholesale funding and deposit costs outside of quarterly day count our nim from here will largely be a function of the changes in our balance sheet mix the impacts of interest rates beyond forwards wholesale funding costs and the impacts of competition on loan yields and deposit betas turning to slide i will end by discussing our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio was at the end of the second quarter down about basis points from the prior quarter net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases and growth in riskweighted assets we continue to estimate that our long term cet1 capital need is around in the quarter the pace of our repurchases slowed to about billion the pace of any future repurchases will be driven by a number of factors including our actual and forecasted capital earnings growth economic conditions and market dynamics with that i will turn the call over to rich rich capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 richard d fairbank founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you andrew and good evening everyone ill begin on slide with second quarter results in our credit card business yearoveryear growth in purchase volume and loans coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results which are shown on slide our domestic card business posted another quarter of strong yearoveryear growth in every topline metric purchase volume for the second quarter was up yearoveryear and up compared to the second quarter of ending loan balances increased billion or about yearoveryear ending loans grew from the sequential quarter and revenue was up yearoveryear driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin strong credit results continued in the quarter both the chargeoff rate and the delinquency rate continued to gradually normalize but remain well below prepandemic levels the domestic card chargeoff rate for the quarter was a basis point improvement yearoveryear the delinquency rate at quarterend was basis points above the prior year on a linked quarter basis the chargeoff rate was up basis points roughly in line with normal seasonal patterns the delinquency rate was up basis points from the linked quarter which we when we typically see modest seasonal improvement noninterest expense was up from the second quarter of driven by an increase in marketing total company marketing expense was about billion in the quarter our choices in domestic card marketing are the biggest but not the only driver of total company marketing trends the primary noncard driver of increased marketing is in our consumer banking business where were marketing to drive deposit growth and build customer franchise in our digitalfirst national banking strategy in our domestic card business we continue to see opportunities to book accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns and we continue to lean into marketing to drive growth and build a franchise across our domestic card businesses were keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risk and as always we underwrite to a worsening scenario even as we lean into marketing were seeing the success of our marketing in strong growth in purchase volume new accounts and loans across our domestic card business and we continue to gain traction in our decadelong focus on heavy spenders in the second quarter heavyspender marketing includes increased early spend bonuses driven by strong first quarter account growth and spending as well as investments in franchise enhancements like our travel portal and airport lounges as a result of our marketing we posted strong growth in heavyspender accounts and strong engagement and spend behaviors with new and existing customers were gaining share and building a longterm franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the market pulling up our heavyspender franchise has a different economic mix than some of our other card businesses it has significantly higher upfront costs of brand building marketing and promotions and investments in highend experiences however the longterm economics are compelling and as our heavyspender franchise has grown significantly in recent years its impact has quietly and gradually changed several domestic card metrics and financial results capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 heavyspender credit losses are low which lowers overall domestic card loss rates all other things being equal naturally high heavyspender payment behaviors are a key driver of our longterm trend of increasing domestic card payment rate and high payment rates go handinhand with strong credit performance heavyspender attrition is very low and thats been a factor in our strong domestic card loan growth heavy spenders have a particularly large impact on increasing purchase volume and have been a major driver of strong domestic card purchase volume growth that has generally exceeded loan growth over time this spend velocity has driven increases in net interchange revenue in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue and these interchange fee revenue annuities are strong and sustained over very longterm customer relationships our heavyspender franchise generates financial results that are attractive less volatile and very resilient as a result the heavyspender business requires less capital and delivers strong longterm returns on capital pulling way up our 10year quest to build our heavyspender franchise has brought with it significantly increased levels of marketing but the sustained revenue credit resilience and capital benefits of this enduring franchise are compelling and theyre growing slide shows second quarter results for our consumer banking business in the second quarter choices we made in our auto business impacted several consumer banking trends we pulled back on growth in auto in response to competitive pricing dynamics as youd expect many auto lenders have raised pricing as rising interest rates drove higher marginal funding cost but some others have kept pricing relatively flat these competitors have gained market share and pressured industry margin we chose to pull back on auto originations which declined yearoveryear and from the linked quarter as we pulled back on originations the yearoveryear growth of ending loans in the consumer banking business decelerated to in the second quarter on a linked quarter basis ending loans were up second quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up yearoveryear aided in part by the transfer of a small portfolio of deposits from our commercial bank consumer banking deposits declined from the sequential quarter consumer banking revenue was essentially flat compared to the prioryear quarter as growth in auto loans was offset by the effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees and the yearoveryear decline in auto margins auto margin compression was primarily driven by the increase in our marginal funding costs resulting from rapid interest rate increases and the aggressive competitor pricing that i just discussed noninterest expense was up compared to the second quarter of driven by the increased marketing for our digital national bank and continuing investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses second quarter provision for credit losses swung from a net benefit of million in the second quarter of to a net expense of million we added to the allowance for credit losses in our auto business in the quarter compared to an allowance release in the yearago quarter the auto chargeoff rate and delinquency rate continue to gradually normalize but we remain well below pre pandemic levels the chargeoff rate for the second quarter was up basis points from the unsustainably low in fact negative quarterly chargeoff rate a year ago the 30plus delinquency rate was capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 up basis points yearoveryear on a linked quarter basis the chargeoff rate was down basis points and the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points slide shows second quarter results for our commercial banking business which delivered strong growth in loans and revenue in the quarter second quarter ending loan balances were up from the sequential quarter average loans increased growth in selected industry specialties drove our growth ending deposits were down from the first quarter and down yearoveryear driven in part by the transfer of a small portfolio of deposits to our retail bank that i mentioned a few moments ago as well as rate driven runoff as some customers withdrew deposits in search of higher returns in the second quarter deposit balances were also impacted by seasonal outflows second quarter revenue was up from the linked quarter and from the prioryear quarter noninterest expense was down modestly from the linked quarter and up yearoveryear provision for credit losses increased million from the first quarter largely driven by a build in the allowance for credit losses commercial banking credit remained strong in the second quarter the commercial banking annualized charge off rate was basis points the criticized performing loan rate was and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was in closing we continued to drive good growth in card revenue purchase volume and loans in the second quarter consumer banking loan growth continued albeit at a slower pace and our commercial banking business posted strong growth in loans and revenue credit results remain strong across our businesses with chargeoff rates and delinquency rates well below prepandemic levels even as credit continues to gradually normalize and we continued to return capital to our shareholders for more than three decades we have hardwired resilience into every underwriting and growth choice we make in good times and bad and weve steadfastly focused on building an enduring franchise sticking to these core tenets weve demonstrated resilience through several cycles weve been in a strong position to seize opportunities as markets evolve and as cycles played out and weve delivered significant value over the long term and were living by these same core tenets today we continue to see opportunities to lean into marketing and resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities long after the normalization trends and cyclical credit pressures play out were confident in the choices were making as we continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and increasing economic uncertainty our credit results remain strong were staying focused on the most resilient businesses and subsegments and were continuing to hone the proprietary underwriting and product structures that have driven our resilience through prior cycles all of these growth in credit risk management choices are enhanced by our technology transformation were managing costs tightly even as we continue to invest in transforming our technology and digital capabilities that are the engine of future growth and efficiency while the imperatives and marketplace opportunities and risks impact the timing we remain focused on delivering operating leverage over the long term powered by growth and digital productivity gains and were managing capital prudently to put ourselves in a strong position to weather a broad range of possible economic scenarios and to emerge in a strong position to capitalize on opportunities that are often generated as cycles play out capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 pulling way up we believe that our longstanding core tenets and the choices they drive today are putting us in a strong position to continue to deliver resilience and compelling longterm shareholder value as the sweeping digital transformation of banking continues and now well be happy to answer your questions danielle danielle dietz managing vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp thanks rich we will now start the qa session as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup question if you have any followup questions after the qa session the investor relations team will be available after the call melinda please start the qa session question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and well go first to ryan nash of goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening everyone richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp good evening ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc rich maybe just to start off on marketing which was up again sequentially have we seen the peak impacts of the early bonuses and maybe just more broadly are you guys still leaning in and maybe you could just talk about the decision in the context of where we are in the economy with inflation and maybe are you pulling back in any pockets just given whats going on across the customer base richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp ryan we on the early bonuses i mean thats really tied to how hard we lean into venture x for example i mean we have early spend bonuses pretty much across our rewards business so let me separate a little bit that so we have the launch of venture x and some companies launches are sort of a quarterlong kind of thing we continue to lean into that youve seen our national advertising continue on that so the early spend bonuses continue as part of that and then also their early spend bonuses at a stable rate for some of our other rewards products as well with respect to the economy its not lost on us that theres a lot of noise out there in the economy and every day we talk about this and theres always uncertainty theres probably i think more uncertainty at the moment and probably on average and thats not lost on us so we dont make a topofthehouse decision that says were capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 going to spend this much on marketing because these decisions are very decisions at the margin based on models and estimated loss rates and putting resilience factors in there and response rates and a lot of things there has been some trimming around the edges in card quite a bit more so in auto by the way as i talked about just a few minutes ago but staying with card for a minute there has been some trimming around the edges but generally the kind of core target segments that weve been going after we are continuing to feel good about and lean into so i think your net impression should be that while we have a very watchful eye on the economy and obsess about it every day our underwriting decisions underwrite systematically at capital one we underwrite to a worsening scenario and so we feel good about our originations but one thing about our tech transformation that has really been good also is it allows us to move and adapt much more quickly in most in companies and frankly in some of our past years when we decided to turn it sometimes took quite a bit of time to move the whole machine weve been able to create a much more adaptive and responsive infrastructure at capital one and so thats also helpful in a time of uncertainty but netnet we feel good about the opportunities and were leaning into them danielle dietz a managing vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you next well hear from kevin barker of piper sandler kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you very much could you further discuss some of the things that youre seeing on the auto sector just given where its been throughout where we saw really good performance and then now it just seems like the combination of rising delinquency rates unresponsive yields and just some softening in used car prices are really impacted can you just give us an outlook on what your expectations are and how capital ones going to react through this year and potentially in a recessionary environment in thank you danielle dietz a managing vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp rich i think you need to unmute yourself richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp oh sorry sorry kevin thank you the auto business is one that i mean were still we still see significant opportunity in the auto business but of course what we always share with investors is how were feeling at the moment and at the margin so the biggest atthemoment thing that we wanted to share with you is how the competitive environment feels and weve been saying for some time that the low chargeoffs we worry that too long of a period of low chargeoffs and too long of a period of in many ways unsustainably high used car prices can dull the senses of players in the auto industry and cause a weakening in underwriting we havent really seen thats not the primary story that we see we certainly are on the lookout for that the story has really been more hijacked if you will by whats happened with inflation and the significant increase for capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 companies and in cost of funds and most auto players and certainly the money center in particular have moved up their pricing very consistently and responsibly to the increases in the underlying cost of funds in the economy and what is striking is that some competition has not there are a few large players whose movement in pricing is well behind that and then you have the credit unions who have i think a very different kind of business model and a different way to calculate what their funding cost is the credit unions have really not moved at all in terms of their pricing and theyve had actually a very significant increase in market share so we are we continue to be very dedicated to the auto business we have relationships with dealers were not this is not like a huge pullback but what were doing at the margin is with the tighter margins that now at least temporarily exist in the business for us that has led us to trim around the edges thats i think the biggest story that we would say in auto the other thing is used car pricing lets talk just a little bit about that kevin vehicle values remain strikingly high and obviously well above prepandemic level and supply constraints remain the biggest factors supporting high vehicle values and everything that we see suggests vehicle production will remain constrained in the near term and even when production normalizes i think it will take time for dealers to rebuild their inventories so probably the nearterm outlook is pretty good with respect to used car values but if i pull up a concern that ive often voiced is that from an underwriting point of view what really matters is not the absolute level of collateral values but the relative value of collateral values versus the underwriting assumptions that a lender made and so we assume significant declines in collateral values in our underwriting but we have a watchful eye on an industry that for quite some time now has been hopefully not getting used to the used car prices that are at relatively that are at record levels versus anything weve seen in the past so i think the auto opportunity continues to be a significant one for capital one but particularly driven by pricing which may by the way ameliorate for certainly everyone except the credit unions in a relatively short period of time but till then we will continue to be pretty tight around the edges and we wanted to share that with you kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you for that operator next well hear from bill carcache of wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good evening rich capital one has long been known for its rich informationbased analytics how are you thinking about the risk that the strength were seeing in the consumer and labor markets is in and of itself inflationary and could lead the fed to have to do more and since the impact of fed hikes tends to be lagged unemployment tends to continue to increase well after peak fed funds maybe can you talk a little bit about how this dynamic feeds into costs underwriting and reserving models richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay so well thanks lets just kind of pull up and talk about inflation we havent seen sustained inflation in the us in many decades but its been running above for over a year now and it reached i think in june and producer prices are increasing even faster and of course the fed has started raising rates in response and the market expects further increases capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 so what i want to do is maybe list some of the potential impacts to our business of sustained inflation and its mostly negatives so if the economy suffers as a result of efforts to slow inflation we will certainly feel that and the biggest way that we would feel that would be in consumer credit losses consumers also were already starting to feel the impact of price inflation outpacing wage growth also in our lending business higher cost of funds could put pressure on our margins especially if lenders dont adjust pricing in response and were already seeing that in the auto business by the way in the card business just as a comparison ive been struck by generally the responsiveness of the pricing in the card business to be responsively adaptive to interest rates i mean its a variable rate product but also just in terms of the offered rate by competitors that seems to have moved much more dynamically than what weve seen selectively in auto then other things about the impact of interest rate increases let me think weve got you can sometimes see lower demand for credit products just because headline pricing seems higher even if real pricing isnt and in our underwriting well let me just say one thing and you put your finger on it well a striking thing right now is how low the unemployment rate is and we have certainly seen in our modeling of credit over all the decades weve been doing this at capital one from a macroeconomic point of view the biggest direct driver of credit losses is unemployment and so we start in a very strong position now but to your point theres irony in the strength of this position and it could contribute to some of the affects you identified i do want to also just while were on the subject of inflation though just highlight a few favorable effects of inflation as well existing debt levels will decrease in real terms in a period of sustained inflation high vehicle values which support auto credit may be more sustainable in a high inflation environment but in total i think the effects tilt definitely in the negative direction so its a tough thing to model collectively all these things but what we do is we start with sort of a general theory of how this stuff works we try to incorporate it into the decisionmaking that we do and then like a hawk we look for these various effects to happen and are prepared to be responsive and in fact just the one last thing i want to say is ive always felt that its very hard to predict economic cycles i dont think capital one is in a better position than anyone else to predict economic cycles sometimes youve seen us weigh in in predicting credit cycles which can be correlated but not the same thing as that but the most important thing that what i take away from years of doing this is its very hard to predict these cycles the key thing is to underwrite to a resilience level to make it very successfully through cycles and thats been a cornerstone of our strategy actually since the founding day of capital one bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats super helpful rich thank you for taking my question i will let others jump in thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay danielle dietz a managing vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp great next question please capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 operator our next question comes from rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan thanks everybody for taking my question hey rich when i sort of piece together everything that im hearing and looking at the numbers if we particularly focus on the growth and the reserve movements at the consumer lending business the credit card business and the commercial lending business it kind of feels like you are diverging in your outlook in terms of the credit card business outperforming the other businesses likely from a cost perspective is that because of competitive pressures or is there something in line that youre seeing that would cause that divergence richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so rick i dont know if we explicitly run around with a i wouldnt say our view is that stark as you say it but i think that we certainly feel the most bullish about the card business lets talk about why for a second first of all just as the business and with the business model capital one has with the resilience its shown through several downturns now and the power of leveraging data and analytics and mass customization to that business i think that we feel particularly high level of resilience in that business and that has been demonstrated in the past and if anything i think the technology transformation and some of the continued choices weve made like dialing back from highbalance revolvers and other things and as i said the whole heavyspender push i think has put capital one in actually an even stronger position from a resilience point of view also in terms of what we see going on with the in the business there is normalization but it is really quite gradual by the way the normalization is gradual across all of our businesses but i want to point out just a bit of a math point in auto for example auto is normalizing gradually so is card and the front book with respect to auto and card which are both normalizing faster than the back book but by the way ive seen that universally whenever theres normalization one always sees it more in the front book than in sees in back books but if you think about auto as an average life of like two years and credit card last much longer than that and so as there is front book normalization the replacement speed in the portfolio in auto is much faster than in card so even for the same amount of normalization in those two businesses in say the front book youre going to get just mathematically faster normalization in auto so it is our expectation it would be surprising to us if that werent the case more just because of the math of replacement of a more rapidly turning over portfolio so certainly card is the business were most bullish about its the one that were leaning hardest into and youll notice our story here our story is not a universal one that says i know theres a lot of uncertainty out there but we feel great about growth so were leaning into it everywhere you can see an example of what youve seen over the years of how capital one works everything is choices that is made at the margin locally i mean in various businesses and the fact that in auto were pulling back pretty significantly as weve talked about while leaning pretty hard in the card and certain parts of commercial is a window into that very phenomenon richard shane q analyst jpmorgan capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 rich thank you very much richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you danielle dietz a managing vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp rick did you have a followup question okay well go to the next richard shane q analyst jpmorgan no danielle dietz a managing vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp question please melinda operator thank you next well hear from sanjay sakhrani from kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks a question for andrew could you just talk about how you see the nim progressing from here obviously the rate outlook suggests more rates than last quarter maybe just talk about how youre seeing deposit betas progress and sort of how that plays through the nim andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure sanjay why dont i start with beta and just give a little bit of detail there and then feather it into the broader nim question you asked and so when you look at our deposits roughly are a combination of commercial and brokered which have higher betas but really the 800pound gorilla is the something like of the deposits that are in retail so ill focus mostly there and i think looking back on history as a guide is a bit of a challenge in this cycle so weve already seen bps of move in the first months were expecting another bps or so over the next months and in the last rising cycle it took years to just get to bps and in that first year we moved bps in total versus the bps we might see this year and so i share that context to say the faster and larger set of moves coupled with quantitative tightening and the possibility of some competitors being a bit more aggressive to fund their loan growth all will play into how competitors behave and the overall level of deposits and so if i look at the last rising cycle we were at something like bps and the last falling cycle we were around bps but given the factors that i described a moment ago its hard to really pinpoint exactly whats going to transpire looking ahead but i would think our cumulative beta could be around or slightly above the last rising cycle capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 and so in line with what youve seen historically beta moves pretty slowly in the beginning to the first set of hikes and so this quarter you saw that we were high singledigits but the planned rate hikes for the second half of the year are likely going to pressure that beta up and so when i take that and factor it into our nim outside obviously of the quarterly day count effects the tailwinds to our nim are going to be the asset mix moving towards higheryielding assets like card and what we saw in this quarter by the way ending card loans grew faster than average so the more that card is growing relative to other asset classes and the cash and investment portfolio and then just the broader asset yield increases from the higher interest rates those are things that are going to be tailwinds the headwinds are going to be the deposit costs not only from the rising deposit betas that i just described but also wholesale funding costs to the extent that we do more of that and depending on credit spreads in the marketplace but there isnt one dominant force in those factors from where we stand today so i think theyre all going to be pushing against one another and were going to see where that nets out in the coming quarters sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay just a followup question for rich obviously theres been a massive dislocation in the fintech space from a valuation standpoint im curious if you think that presents opportunities for ma for capital one thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks sanjay capital one weve said for a number of years that unlike most banks were not on a quest to go buy other banks and build our national banking franchise that way so and that really where we would do acquisitions it would really be either basically of tech companies themselves that bring a tech capability or fintechs that bring a techbased capability right in our business sweet spot so we have for that reason plus our great interest in learning from fintechs we have been very keen observers of that marketplace we you havent seen much in the way of acquisitions from capital one because of the breathtaking pricing that fintechs have had but certainly to your point as the pricing has crashed in that marketplace we continue to watch the market carefully and our strategy remains the same that we believe that capital one is kind of an ideal buyer for fintechs because we have a modern tech stack and we built a company that feels very much like a tech company and i think is very well suited to acquire and assimilate and provide opportunity to the talent that comes in a tech acquisition so thats sort of the principle behind it so we continue to look in the marketplace and thats the primary acquisition interest that capital one has which is kind of different from i think most banking institutions danielle dietz a managing vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp great next question please operator thank you next well hear from don fandetti of wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 hi rich i was wondering if you could maybe talk about where you see more downside surprise risk on a credit spectrum is it the lower end consumer or is it the affluent heavyspender and i guess on the low end can consumers really weather the strong inflation in particular if unemployment softens a little bit richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so don thank you for that lets start by just talking about the consumer certainly im certainly struck by the starting point of where the consumer is because the us consumer remains quite healthy we see sustained improvements in consumer balance sheets coming out of the pandemic lets see debt servicing burdens remain near like multidecade lows the savings rate has dipped below prepandemic levels over the past few months but cumulative savings over the last two years remain a significant positive still for consumers on average we see higher bank account balances and higher household net worth across the income spectrum labor market demand remains exceptionally strong with record numbers of job openings and solid wage growth and in our own portfolio we see continuing strength in our delinquency roll rates and recovery rates despite times of credit normalization our credit metrics remain strikingly strong by any standard any historical standard so that is the context that we see but to your point the big headwinds for consumers are price inflation and higher interest rates and inflation could erode the excess savings consumers accumulated through the pandemic especially if price increases continue to run ahead of wage growth higher interest rates could push up debt servicing burdens although this effect is muted by the fact that most existing household debt is in fixed rate mortgages and auto loans so im struck by though the strong starting point for consumers as we look into the potential the headwinds of inflation and more economic trouble and i would contrast this of course to the great recession or the global financial crisis which where the consumer was in a much weaker position going into that now the strength of the consumer is pretty much across the board across the from the top of the market into subprime and so i think the thing most striking is how sort of universal it is but it is also the case that normalization is a bit more pronounced in subprime than it is higher in the market but these populations though also improved more and more quickly earlier in the pandemic so i think these trends shouldnt be surprising so i think certainly now fico score and income are not the same thing but a lot of times people tend to state them in the same breath our subprime business is definitionally about people with fico scores below a certain level but i think that the consumer starts in a strong place then we should probably expect normalization to be a little faster on the lower end and interestingly if you switch to kind of income which is a different cut than fico certainly and income im struck by the fact that consumers the wage growth for the lowerincome consumers is theyre kind of the one category the lowerincome consumers where their wage growth has been keeping up with inflation but that wont necessarily continue but thats also a position of strength but pulling way up i think we could see normalization a little faster in subprime i think in fact we already can see very modestly that effect but of course in our underwriting and the whole business model of capital one thats also where we have built in kind of the biggest buffers of resilience so we feel good about that part of the marketplace we feel good really across the credit spectrum and continue to lean in to our marketing opportunity donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it all set thank you capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 danielle dietz a managing vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp all right next question please operator our next question comes from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks rich you had mentioned that you saw good kind of increases in prices for new accounts across the spectrum but at the same time i guess rewards and upfront bonuses have also been very high so can you just talk about how youre seeing the kind of competitive environment particularly for the higherend consumer where youre spending a lot of that effort richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah so competition in the rewards space is id say more intense than prepandemic a bit more intense than prepandemic levels but largely unchanged in recent quarters so early spend bonuses in points offers were slightly more aggressive than in the first quarter and we continue to see certain offers come in and out of market cash early spend bonuses are higher now than prepandemic but have been relatively stable at these elevated levels since basically mid last year and then if we look at the baseline rewards earn rates particularly in the cashbacks space they overall were probably more aggressive in the middle of as new products were being introduced but have been relatively calm since now we feel great about our flagship products we continue to be very pleased by consumers response and engagement with them were very pleased with the launch of our venture x card but i think if i pull way up moshe one of the things that i so deeply believe and have experienced is that winning in the heavyspender space i think it requires good products but you cant win with good products it takes a lot more than that and the customer experience and specifically the digital experience the brand the a lot of experiential things that are sort of way beyond the product are part of the whole package and what we have said this is why weve been saying for years now that winning at the top of the market is not an in and out thing it is a matter of choosing as a few players have done capital one being one of them that thats where were going and were going to continue to lean into that and i have been struck by the sustainable success that we have been generating and also the marketplace while very intense hasnt tipped over to being unreasonable or irrational so its very competitive but i continue to really like our opportunity in that space moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc and maybe just as a followup the yield for the last four quarters in your card business has been pretty flat both the yield on the loans up a little bit this quarter i guess with the rate increases that you talked about but what is it really going to take to get that to be a higher number is it are you going to see more revolving from some of your highend consumers is it what is it going to to get that the level of revenue growth and profitability enhanced capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey moshe its andrew and i think if you put the card yield in the context of a longerterm history looking a year ago its up basis points and thats really been a shift to a higher mix of assets in our branded book which is both growth of existing customers and the success were seeing in the originations that rich talked about and as we sit here today and looking over the last few quarters were also seeing a modest uptick in fees from the very low levels last year and so driven by the delinquencies that have ticked up very gradually yearoveryear but i think having a yield at these levels is something that has sustained but to your point of how can we drive it up i think were seeing an impact from rate changes thats been a bit of a tailwind on the yield side but clearly that comes with a funding cost that ultimately will probably leave margin much closer to flat moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks very much danielle dietz a managing vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from arren cyganovich of citi arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc sorry mute thanks indiscernible the question i just wanted to follow up on that last point youre talking about the benefits of some of these superprime spenders and i guess one of the aspects thats i guess less challenging or less beneficial is that youre not really revolving or they dont tend to revolve nearly as much because that spend velocity is still high and they pay down each month as you think about that customer base growing over time would that just have a natural kind of downward pressure on your domestic card yield andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp well arren it depends a bit on the degree to which theyre revolving versus just pure transacting but if theyre transacting theyre bringing quite a bit of interchange and relatively low outstandings over time so that very well could prove to be a net positive and not create the downward pressure that you just described and not to mention the fact that in doing so it creates less of a capital need and so it ends up being over time at least a pretty capitalefficient business which is one of the reasons why weve been on this decadelong journey to build that franchise arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay got it and then just on the deposit side you had a modest decline kind of seasonal im assuming that had to do with taxes you havent really to your benefit i guess not been a leader in terms of pricing on the online side are you seeing kind of quartertodate an increase in deposits or do you expect that to be a little bit slower growth as we see the rate hikes increase capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp well im not going to comment specifically on what were seeing so far this quarter but lets take a step back and think about the industry context and then talk a little bit about our strategy there as you look at the industry you brought up at least in retail the tax outflow phenomenon that happened in the second quarter and we certainly felt a little bit of that but where industry deposit balances go from here first thing is at least history whether it repeats itself would indicate that the rate of deposit growth drops in rising rate environment and in this particular cycle the fed fund rates as i mentioned to sanjays question are both larger and faster than previous ones and the feds shrinking its balance sheet so who knows my guess is as good as yours but i think we could see a scenario where industrywide deposits are flattish to down in the near term and so what we choose to do there is really trying to optimize our balance sheet across a number of different dynamics of liquidity and funding and tenor and pricing and so we feel like we are in a great position to compete in that industry backdrop with simple straightforward competitive products that have a great user experience but where our deposits ultimately go from here in the context of that industry will be a function of our deposit needs and competitive dynamics richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp arren let me just add that this is i want to underscore the strategy that capital one has had for years now which is we are building a national bank through not by just acquiring branches on every corner across the united states nor by just having a national digital bank but really building a in a sense fullservice digital bank that can provide almost everything that you can get in a local branch to provide it digitally and that is part of our strategy to build primary banking relationships that are digitalfirst and digitallyoriginated and its all part of a larger strategy to build a consumer banking franchise that is not about just the highest rate paid but really about highquality products a great customer experience and a fullservice set of capabilities where people can really move their full banking relationship and then also have savings deposits there and one of my comments that i made about our marketing levels which everybody notices are high is one thing weve continued to invest in over time is capital one as a company that doesnt have branches on every corner weve got branches on some corners but a greater proportion of our expenditures are on the marketing side are on the brand building side and to some extent on the tech side as well but it is very much in service of building a franchise of a brand and a franchise that enables us to dynamically grow our deposits at very appropriate blended pricing and build longterm loyal banking relationships and were very pleased with the success weve had in that but we to continue invest very much in that danielle dietz a managing vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator moving on to betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 hi good evening richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp good evening betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc andrew just wanted to doubleclick on the comments that youre making around the high transactors having lower capital intensity and thats a function of them just being higher credit quality shorter duration on the book is that basically what its about or is there something more there andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp no its really just the loss content of that book betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay and then when you were going through the deck on the capital slide i think you mentioned is your cet1 target and so given that there is such demand for spend and borrow right now should we take your comments to mean that its unlikely that youll be doing buybacks in the near future while this high loan growth period is upon us andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp well just to repeat a little bit betsy of what i shared in my prepared remarks theres just a number of factors to consider just our forecasted level of capital and earnings and growth but we need to put those things in the context with a particular eye to the error bars around those estimates and so what i was mostly trying to highlight is if you look back a year ago we were at cet1 thats down to this quarter and so were getting much closer to that level and at a time when there are number of uncertainties given the economic environment and the growth opportunities those error bars just start to matter more and so we slowed down a bit in the second quarter but as always is the case managing capital both conservatively and efficiently is top of mind for us and so looking ahead were just going to dynamically adjust our pace in the context of those evolving factors betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right okay thank you danielle dietz a managing vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from dominick gabriele of oppenheimer capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co hey thanks so much for taking my question i was wondering if you could provide us with a breakdown of your and remind us of your domestic card spending by retail category as a percent of total spend within domestic card so grocery or te or gas whatever you could provide would be excellent i would just think that as youre targeting the higher spenders its probably had an effect on that mix over the last years as thats changed any color you can provide would be great thanks danielle dietz a managing vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp hey rich you need to unmute please richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp sorry sorry yes sorry i have in front of me i dont think its the exact thing youre asking but i have in front of me some growth rates in fact weve been seeing growth versus of a bunch of categories that i find pretty fascinating but this isnt our own mix but these things in fact indiscernible i guess but gas now by the way this includes growth by capital one overall theres been significant growth of our whole business so but just some relative comparisons travel although travel is second to gas if i look at yearoveryear growth only gas as a category has grown more so gas is up yearoveryear the travel is up yearoveryear and those are swamping most of the other categories there but travel was way the laggard during the downturn and its been like i said other than energy it has been the one that is really catching up quickly so whats striking is just how much these things vary across categories as the consumer reacts to the environment be it covid or energy costs and also itll be interesting to see how much the consumer migrates to whether to between discretionary and nondiscretionary categories well keep a close eye on that one as things get a little tighter in the marketplace dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co great and then maybe just as a followup given just to take some of the conversation one step further around deposits and funding given the amount of card growth that youre seeing and building out this franchise but the slowing deposit growth is it reasonable to assume that as a management team you would really look to focus on growing this business first regardless of perhaps the funding cost tradeoff between deposits and nondeposit funding because really youre just gaining more customers within your card franchise and you would make that trade thanks so much richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah so first pulling up its not lost on us that our assets are growing rapidly right now all banks are growing more slowly in deposits so we i think that i mean this is a natural thing that happens at this part of the cycle and so this is why i made my earlier comments about being very pleased that we have already been leaning into having a deposit franchise and being in a position to build primary banking relationships to grow savings accounts to have a brand as a company that will have attractive savings rates but not to have to go generate all our business off of the bank rate tables kind of marketplace capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 so but with respect to the economics dominick i think the card margins are such that its hard to imagine that we wouldnt continue to make the trade that even if we have to pay more for deposits we would not turn down the growth opportunity so long as the deposits are available and theyre there its going to be a good trade to continue growing that card business as far out as we can see because of the particularly robust economics that come with our card franchise but just to danielle dietz a managing vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp great richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp finish off that point im sorry but we also like being in a position as a national bank with a national brand for digital banking that were in a position to gather the deposits we need in order to fund the kind of growth opportunity that we have at a time when its going to get harder to grow deposits at this part of the cycle danielle dietz managing vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp great well thank you everyone for joining us on this conference call today and thank you for your interest in capital one the investor relations team will be here this evening to answer your questions if you have any and have a great evening richard d fairbank founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial
