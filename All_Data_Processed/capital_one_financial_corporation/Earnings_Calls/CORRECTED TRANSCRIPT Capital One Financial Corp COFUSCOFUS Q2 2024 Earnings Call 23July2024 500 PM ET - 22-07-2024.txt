afternoon everyone i will start on slide of tonights presentation in the second quarter capital one earned million or per diluted common share included in the results for the quarter were adjusting items related to the walmart partnership termination discover integration costs and an accrual for our updated estimate of the fdics special assessment net of these adjusting items second quarter earnings per share were relative to the prior quarter periodend loans held for investment increased while average loans were flat ending deposits were flat versus last quarter while average deposits increased our percentage of fdic insured deposits increased percentage point to of total deposits preprovision earnings in the second quarter increased from the first quarter revenue in the linked quarter increased driven by higher net and noninterest income while noninterest expense decreased driven by a decline in operating expense our provision for credit losses was billion in the quarter the 12billion increase in provision relative to the prior quarter was almost entirely driven by higher allowance included in the second quarter was an 826million allowance build from the elimination of the losssharing provisions that occurred within the termination of the walmart partnership the remaining quarter overquarter provision increase was driven by a 353million higher net reserve build and a 28million increase in net chargeoffs turning to slide i will cover the allowance in greater detail we built billion in allowance this quarter the allowance balance now stands at billion our total portfolio coverage ratio increased basis points to the increase in this quarters allowance and coverage ratio was largely driven by a build in our card segments ill cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide in our domestic card business the allowance coverage ratio increased by basis points to the substantial majority of the increase in coverage was driven by the impact of the termination of the walmart loss sharing agreement in our consumer banking segment the allowance decreased by million resulting in a 5basispoint decrease to the coverage ratio and finally our commercial banking allowance increased by million coverage ratio remained essentially flat at turning to page ill now discuss liquidity total liquidity reserves in the quarter decreased about billion to approximately billion our cash position ended the quarter at approximately billion down about billion from the prior quarter the decrease was driven by wholesale funding maturities loan growth and declines in our commercial deposits partially offset by deposit growth in our retail banking business you can see our capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was down from in the first quarter turning to page ill cover our net interest margin our second quarter net interest margin was basis point higher than last quarter and basis points higher than the yearago quarter the relatively flat quarter overquarter nim was the result of largely offsetting factors nim in the quarter benefited from the termination of the revenuesharing agreement with walmart as well as modestly higher yields in the auto business these two factors were roughly offset by the seasonal effects on yield in the card portfolio and a slight increase in the rate paid on retail deposits turning to slide i will end by discussing our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio ended the quarter at basis points higher than the prior quarter net income in the quarter was largely offset by the impact of dividends and million of share repurchases during the quarter the federal reserve released the results of their stress test our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement is resulting in a cet1 requirement of however as we disclosed in our last 10q the announcement of the acquisition of discover constituted a material business change as a result we are subject to the federal reserves preapproval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded with that i will turn call over to rich rich richard d fairbank founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks andrew and good evening everyone slide shows second quarter results in our credit card business credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on slide in the second quarter our domestic card business delivered another quarter of strong results as we continued to invest in flagship products and exceptional customer experiences to grow our franchise yearoveryear purchase volume growth for the quarter was ending loan balances increased billion or about yearoveryear average loans also increased about and second quarter revenue was up driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans revenue margin for the quarter remained strong at the revenue margin includes a positive impact of about basis points resulting from the partial quarter effect of the end of the walmart revenuesharing agreement the chargeoff rate for the quarter was the partial quarter impact of the end of the walmart losssharing agreement increased the quarterly chargeoff rate by basis points excluding this impact the chargeoff rate for the quarter would have been up basis points yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate at quarterend was up basis points from the prior year as a reminder the end of the walmart losssharing agreement did not have a meaningful impact on delinquency rate the pace of yearoveryear increases in both the chargeoff rate and the delinquency rate have been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in the second quarter on a sequential quarter basis the capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 chargeoff rate excluding the walmart impact was down basis points and the 30plus delinquency rate was down basis points domestic card noninterest expense was up compared to the second quarter of primarily driven by higher marketing expense total company marketing expense in the quarter was billion up yearover year our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing we continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our domestic card business our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business compared to the second quarter of domestic card marketing in the quarter included increased marketing to grow originations at the top of the marketplace higher media spend and increased investment in differentiated customer experiences like our travel portal airport lounges and capital one shopping slide shows second quarter results for our consumer banking business after returning to positive growth last quarter auto originations were up yearoveryear in the second quarter consumer banking ending loans were down billion or yearoveryear and average loans were down on a linkedquarter basis ending loans were up and average loans were flat compared to the year ago quarter ending consumer deposits were up about and average deposits were up consumer banking revenue for the quarter was down about yearoveryear largely driven by higher deposit costs and lower average loans compared to the prior year quarter noninterest expense was up about compared to the second quarter of driven by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank the auto chargeoff rate for the quarter was up basis points yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points yearoveryear largely as the result of our choice to tighten credit and pullback in auto chargeoffs have been strong and stable slide shows second quarter results for our commercial banking business compared to the linked quarter ending loan balances decreased about average loans were also down about the modest declines are largely the result of choices we made in to tighten credit ending deposits were down about from the linked quarter average deposits were down about the declines are largely driven by our continued choices to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances second quarter revenue was essentially flat from the linked quarter and noninterest expense was lower by about the commercial banking annualized net chargeoff rate for the second quarter increased basis points from the sequential quarter to the commercial banking criticized performing loan rate was up basis points compared to the linked quarter the criticized nonperforming loan rate increased basis points to in closing we continued to deliver strong results in the second quarter we delivered another quarter of top line growth in domestic card loans purchase volume and revenue and a second consecutive quarter of yearover year growth in auto originations consumer credit trends continued to show stability and our operating efficiency ratio improved capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 we had guided to annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustment to be flat to modestly down compared to assuming the cfpb late fee rule takes effect in october and were on a very consistent path with what we expected when we gave that guidance if the implementation of the rule is delayed that would be a tailwind to annual operating efficiency ratio one thing that has changed is the walmart relationship our partnership ended in the second quarter which will increase chargeoff rates but have a positive impact on operating efficiency ratio including the walmart impact we expect full year operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to be modestly down compared to we continue to lean into marketing to grow and to further strengthen our franchise in the domestic card business we continue to get traction in originations across our products and channel and our origination opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation which enables us to leverage machine learning at scale to identify the most attractive growth opportunities and customize our marketing offers were also getting traction in building our franchise at the top of the market with heavy spenders it is not lost on us that competitive intensity and marketing levels are increasing at the very top of the market and we know we have important investments to make we continue to be pleased to see our investments pay off in customer and spend growth and returns and were building an enduring franchise with annuitylike revenue streams very low losses and very low attrition in consumer banking our modern technology and leading digital capabilities are powering our digital first national banking strategy and were leaning even harder into marketing to grow our national checking franchise which has had industryleading pricing with no fees and industryleading customer satisfaction pulling up marketing is a key driver of current and future growth and value creation across the company and were leaning hard into our marketing investments we expect total company marketing in the second half of to be meaningfully higher than the first half similar to the pattern we saw last year we are allin and working hard to complete the discover acquisition our applications for regulatory approval are in process and were fully mobilized to plan and deliver a successful integration we continue to expect that well be in a position to complete the acquisition late this year or early next year subject to regulatory and shareholder approval the combination of capital one and discover creates gamechanging strategic opportunities the discover payments network positions capital one as a more diversified vertically integrated global payments platform and adding capital ones debit spending and a growing portion of our credit card purchase volume to the discover network will add significant scale increasing the networks value to merchants small businesses and consumers and driving enhanced network growth in credit cards and consumer banking were bringing together proven franchises with complementary strategies and a shared focus on the customer and we will be able to leverage and scale the benefits of our 11year technology transformation across every business and the network pulling way up the acquisition of discover is a singular opportunity it will create a consumer banking and global payments platform with unique capabilities modern technology powerful brand and a franchise of more than million customers it delivers compelling financial results and offers the potential to create significant value for merchants and customers capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp thanks rich well now start the qa session as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup if you have any followup questions after the qa session investor relations team will be available after the call josh please start the qa question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw you may proceed sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks rich andrew just looking at the credit metrics as rich mentioned it seems like the trends are pretty favorable i mean in most segments things are improving if not stable and then us card theres an improving trend in that second derivative im just curious how we should think about reserve rate going forward because i think even excluding the walmart impact the reserve rate went higher andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure sanjay well let me start by covering this quarters allowance and then ill talk about the future so in the quarter as you said first we had the effect of walmart the million build that we spelled out as an adjusting item we also reserved for the growth we saw in the quarter beyond that coverage in card as you referenced grew i think it was just over basis points which is a little over of the allowance balance and so as part of that process each quarter not only are we rolling forward our baseline forecast but were also looking at a range of macroeconomic and consumer behavior uncertainties including things like the changing seasonal customer behavior we talked about last quarter and so as a result in this quarter we increased the qualitative factors to reflect those uncertainties and thats what drove the modest increase in coverage this quarter as i look ahead and talking conceptually here but in a period where projected loss rates in future quarters are projected to stabilize and ultimately decline and might indicate a decline in the coverage ratio i would say you could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat for some period of time as we incorporate the uncertainty of those future projections into the allowance in a period where forecasted losses are rising were quick to incorporate those higher forecasted losses and also potentially add qualitative factors for uncertainty like you saw early in the pandemic but i would say it is unlikely to be symmetric on the way down and so eventually the projected stabilizing and ultimately lower losses will flow through the allowance particularly as the uncertainties around that forecast become more certain but at this point im not going to be in the business of forecasting when thats actually going to take place for us capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and then rich maybe you could just talk about the consumer and sort of the uncertainties there is there any discernible like change that youve seen since the last quarter in terms of the state of the consumer weve obviously seen the spending trend sort of slow somewhat across the industry but anything else to sort of point out richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp sanjay i think what we see is something thats very stable the us consumer remains a source of strength in the overall economy of course the labor market remains strikingly resilient rising incomes have kept consumer debt servicing burdens relatively low by historical standards despite high interest rates when we look at our customers we see that on average they have higher bank balances than before the pandemic and this is true across income levels on the other hand inflation shrank real incomes for almost two years and weve only recently seen real wage growth turn positive again and in this high interest rate environment the cost of new borrowing has gone up in every major asset class mortgages auto loans and credit cards so well obviously keep an eye on that and i think at the margin these effects are almost certainly stretching some consumers financially but on the whole id say consumers are in reasonably good shape relative to most historical benchmarks and as our credit numbers came in month by month technical difficulty im sorry can you hear you hear me can you still hear me you can hear me okay i just had some cross message coming in on my phone but with respect to credit we were very pleased with the credit performance in the quarter we had talked a bit about the seasonality maybe people want to ask a question about that but we saw basically pulling up we see things settling out nicely in the card business and things are very strong in the auto business jeff norris a senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from mihir bhatia with bank of america you may proceed mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi thanks for taking my question maybe just turning to nim for a second with the fed or at least expectations for rate cuts coming into view can you just comment on the current backdrop for deposit competition and how do you expect deposit betas to trend during the early stages of the fed ratecutting cycle andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 sure mihir what weve seen at least within our walls and you saw evidence of it this quarter in a quarter where seasonally you typically see a decline in deposit balances looking at h8 data we saw a few i think it was billion of growth weve been quite pleased over the course of the last couple of years with all of the investments weve made over many years in building a deposit franchise and are certainly benefiting from that and so with respect to the beta going forward first looking at what we saw in the up cycle here the total cumulative beta that weve seen in this cycle this quarter i think cumulatively was and so assuming that the feds next move is to bring rates down its hard to precisely predict whats going to happen to deposit costs and therefore betas and in particular the pace of those declines because market dynamics competitive pricing actions other actions related to companies looking to potentially preserve nim thats going to drive betas in the future cycle but i think you get a pretty good sense for our pricing and mix based on what you saw in the up cycle and within that backdrop that i just described thats going to influence what happens to our beta on the way down mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc got it thats helpful thank you and then just switching back to the health of the customer overall as you look across your portfolio weve heard a little bit of talk about people pulling back particularly on discretionary spend and lower income cohorts et cetera is there a dynamic you are also seeing when you look at your customer base and then relatedly rich mentioned how pleased he is with the progress youre making on the higher income side if you will in that highend transactor balance side i was just wondering how does that change your portfolio as you think about it like over the next few years like as you grow that book further richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes well thank you so much just with respect to spending we see pretty proportional movement in discretionary versus nondiscretionary spending nothing really striking there when we look at the portfolio spending metrics the spend per customer is really pretty flat when you see spend growth at a company like capital one and the purchase volume growth is really being driven by the new accounts so things are really pretty stable flat and stable healthy but pretty flat on a per customer basis with respect to the question about the gradual transition of our portfolio to a higher end customer let me just pull up and talk about that we have for decades been a company that sort of serves the mass market really from the top of the credit spectrum through to even down to some subprime customers and we have continued very consistently with this strategy probably the most striking thing though thats happened over the last or years i guess years ago is when we launched the venture card we have systematically leaned into going after the top of the market not leaving the other behind but really as an additive strategy and we have continued through our marketing and through the products that were offering to just keep moving higher and higher in terms of the target customers and the traction that were getting and by the way we continue even as were growing purchase volume overall where we see the highest growth rates in purchase volume are as we go higher in the market so were very happy about that and when we think about the portfolio effects that happened there this is one thing that we see is that payment rates have along that journey gone up quite a bit at capital one and when weve looked to see our payment capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 rates coming back to where they were prepandemic they probably just arent going to return all the way because that would be a reflection of the portfolio shift we just in general have had the kind of mix shift that youd expect with higher payment rates and just higher levels of spend higher spend rate in the business and thats been very successful but from an outstandings point of view the top of the market business doesnt have that much impact on outstandings because these folks generally pay in full so when you see the outstandings movements of capital one its pretty consistently driven by the mass market part of our business its just that inside some of the portfolio metrics are moving because of the mix shift toward more spenders thank you jeff norris a senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from rick shane with jpmorgan you may proceed richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my question this afternoon look given the breadth of your reach across the consumer income levels can you talk a little bit about sort of any patterns that youre seeing weve heard for example some slowdown in spending for lower income consumers im curious particularly youd made a comment earlier in the quarter about an increase in minimum payment rates im curious if youre seeing anything in terms of payment behavior that we should consider by income level richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah okay so lets just pull up for a minute on just talking about how the subprime consumer is holding up so way back in the global financial crisis we observed that credit metrics in subprime moved earlier in both directions subprime also worsened less on a percentage basis than prime but of course in absolute deltas it still moved more in the pandemic subprime credit moved more and more quickly than prime it normalized more quickly and appeared basically to stabilize sooner as well and thats in the context of lower income consumers seeing disproportionate benefits of government aid and forbearance on financial products and then the unwinding of that over time and so subprime is of course not synonymous with lower income although theyre correlated and we saw these effects across credit both in talking about the credit spectrum and also the income gradient so on the other hand just a couple of other effects just on the credit side that have happened over the recent years subprime consumers have been subject to more industry credit supply including fintech competition during and after the pandemic so thats been something weve always kept a close eye on and worried about whether that was going to disproportionately impact the credit performance of subprime customers i dont really i mean given the overall pretty strong performance in subprime i think we havent seen that effect too much another thing to point out is that income growth has been consistently higher for lower income consumers over the past several years and this is the opposite of what we saw during and after the global financial crisis but while no two cycles are alike i think again were seeing that subprime consumers and lower income consumers again theyre not the same thing but they tend to move earlier but not necessarily more than the overall market capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 now lets talk a little bit about payment rates so throughout the course of the pandemic payment rates increased not only for us but across the industry and more recently payment rates have drifted down from pandemic highs as the effects of stimulus have waned and the payment rates generally we have seen this effect so the effect that weve seen of payment rates going down relative to where they were one to two years ago relative to their peak basically in every part of our business they have come down but are still above where they were prepandemic and again i think part of that is the mix effect that we talked about in the prior question theres a mix effect not only across our whole portfolio but even within the segments of our portfolio we just had more emphasis on the spender side versus the revolver side internally and so i think you see some of that showing up in the metrics one other thing i want to say is that i talk about your question about minimum payments so we have simultaneously were sort of seeing an effect where payment rates while theyre going down continue to be well above prepandemic levels even as the percentage of customers paying minimum payments this by the way is not a subprime effect this is a portfolio effect im talking about the percent of customers paying minimum payments is also somewhat above prepandemic levels now it seems a little odd to have both of those effects happening at the same time but i think in many ways this is a very natural way that normalization is happening and youve heard us talk for a long time now about what we call the delayed chargeoff effect in consumer credit that so many customers got stimulus and forbearance that i think a lot of people who otherwise would have charged off were able to avoid that chargeoff many hopefully were able to permanently avoid that but for some we have believed it was more of a deferral of an inevitability and this phenomenon of delayed chargeoffs which cant be separately measured we believe is a driving factor behind why credit has been settling out higher than prepandemic because i think theres just a delayed chargeoff effect for some of these customers who otherwise would have charged off earlier and that then would be consistent with a very healthy consumer payment rates generally even being higher than pre pandemic but there is a tail of consumers paying a higher percentage on minimum payments and some of them going through a chargeoff that might have otherwise happened a few years earlier jeff norris a senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs you may proceed ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good afternoon rich so maybe to ask about marketing so i think the guide that you provided said around billion roughly of marketing spend in the second half and you talked a little bit about the competitive intensity in the top of the market is increasing can you maybe just talk about how much of the increase in marketing is being driven by investing more to acquire more customers versus competition pushing up the cost to acquire and then just given what you just talked about around lowend consumers are you pulling back and else anywhere to cover the increased cost of acquiring capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp ryan our comments about the competitive intensity let me just elaborate a little bit more about that the card business is very competitively intense across the spectrum its been consistently intense competition in things like rewards have certainly heated up over the last couple of years and the thing that i was pointing out is just something that again is not something that is like the realization of the last month or so its a phenomenon weve seen for some time but it is striking which is at the very top of the market we are seeing for the especially a couple of competitors that we have that most intensely play at the very top of the market you can just absolutely see they are stepping up investing more in lounges in experiences in dining investing in companies marketing levels im sure all the investors can see it we can all see it and they talk about it and its not lost on us that these are strong competitors and we certainly have we already have had very important investment plans in these areas and we note that others are investing heavily too but with respect to the let me just now kind of pull up now and just talk about the marketing sort of where we are from a marketing point of view we continue to see great opportunities and really across our businesses we remain very excited about the success of our origination activities especially in our card products and channels and of course whats happening in the bank the two big areas that are driven by marketing spend this continues to be powered by our technology transformation and just to savor a little bit because we often pointed that why does the technology transformation help here it gives us the ability to leverage more and more data and machine learning models to identify the most attractive growth opportunities and it allows us to increasingly tailor our solutions to down to the individual customer level to ensure that were meeting them right where we are so kind of the first point i would say and key reason were leaning into the marketing is were getting a lot of traction and our tech transformation is certainly helping to power more opportunities secondly we continue to expand on our success in building a franchise at the top of the market and with heavy spenders in this quest well for years weve been talking about going after the top of the market every year as we get more traction we reached just a little bit higher these customers are very attractive in addition to the obvious spend growth they generate strong revenue very low losses low attrition and the business helps elevate our brand really across the company now its also something that weve known all along is that its expensive and requires quite a bit of investment to build a business at the top of the market in the form of upfront costs and also in the form of a sustained commitment to customer benefits and experiences and building a brand so yeah you have earlyspend bonuses that are important cost of doing business that shows up in the marketing line item brand makes a huge difference and brand of course requires a longterm commitment to build and as we continue move up the market we are moving increasingly into areas where consumers are looking for exclusive services and experiences that arent available in the general marketplaces such as airport lounges and access to select properties and iconic experiences so weve seen at the top of the market our two biggest competitors really lean in here and we certainly are leaning in as well ryan i wouldnt there are some times ive seen over the years that marketing levels just rise and so you just got to market more and more and more just to hold your own and i dont feel that were in an environment like this i feel that the certainly competitive intensity is increasing capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 but when were talking about in general in the card business where competitive intensity is increasing a bit and specifically with respect to these investments at the top of the market these are just important things that you have to build and win at the top of the market but we are very pleased with the traction were getting the economics of our heavy spender business and so this is we just its just not lost on us a couple of our other competitors are very focused on the same thing so we continue to lean into growth here both in terms of upfront customer acquisition and our ongoing investment in brand and exclusive experiences and benefits now let me now turn to the third part of our marketing story which is our investment in building our national bank so this has been a journey that weve been on for many many years when we bought ing direct way back in we said this is going to be not only a great financial acquisition but its going to be a transformational strategic acquisition because now as a player with a significant branch network and a national direct bank we have the building blocks to build a unique national bank and thats what were building a digital first national bank weve got smaller physical branch networks that we lean more on our café network which is in cafés in of the top msas lean very heavily into our digital experiences and really importantly without a branch on every corner across the united states the role for capital one that marketing and brand play in building this national banking business is absolutely a central role so we are very pleased with the growth that were getting the traction the performance of this business and the opportunity just gets bigger when we think about in the context of the combined entity now joining force with discover so these are the compelling opportunities behind our marketing growth and we continue to feel really good about the success and the opportunities in front of us and thats why we are leaning in very much into the marketing and specifically with respect to the rest of the year why we pointed to and of course virtually every year at capital one the second half of the year has quite a bit more marketing than the first half we pointed to a pattern kind of like what we saw last year in terms of proportional increases in marketing thanks ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for the color jeff norris a senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research securities you may proceed bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good evening rich and andrew following up on your credit commentary there had been an expectation among many investors that we would see peak chargeoffs somewhere around the second half of this year given the delinquency trends that youre seeing is that a reasonable expectation and if so it seems like your credit outlook has derisked somewhat given an improving loss trajectory but higher reserve rate driven by qualitative factors is that a fair thought process capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 then ill just ask my followup as part of this you mentioned andrew that your capital return is subject to fed approval given the pending acquisition how should we think about the pace of incremental buybacks as we look ahead at the rest of the year thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp oh yeah bill yeah let me make a couple comments on credit let me seize the moment in the spirit of henry kissinger who says i hope you have questions for my answers let me just ask myself a question so i can answer it because its going to set the table for answering your question which you may remember last quarter we pointed at tax refund patterns and said that there may be a new seasonality pattern emerging and it would be too early to call that but it was making it a little bit things were not following as closely on a monthbymonth basis to some prepandemic delinquency patterns that our hypothesis was three months ago that were seeing a tax refund effect so let me just talk about that for a second and then bill ill pull up and talk about just sort of what does this mean for sort of how i feel about where we are with respect to credit so lets just talk for a second about how seasonality works weve always seen seasonal credit patterns in our card business and our portfolio trend they have generally been more theyve had more pronounced seasonal patterns than the industry average i think thats because we have a higher subprime component and those customers are even more linked i think to the seasonal patterns associated with tax refunds that would be our hypothesis there now the second quarter tends to be the seasonal low point for delinquencies and  tends to be the seasonal high point for delinquencies card losses lag relative to delinquencies the losses tend be seasonally lowest in the third quarter and highest in the first quarter now we believe that tax refunds again are a significant driver of these seasonal trends and tax refunds drive a large seasonal improvement in delinquent payments in the februarymarch time period which then flows through to lower delinquencies in april and may and then to lower chargeoffs and tax refunds also drive a seasonal uptick in our recoveries so the tax code actually new tax withholding rules went into effect way back in they were passed in went into effect in but the pandemic and the normalization since then have kind of swamped seasonality so we havent really been able to get a really good read of it so weve tended to benchmark to the seasonality of prepandemic like and but weve now had several more months to look at this pattern and were seeing a pattern well let me back up what weve done is what we call detrending of our credit metrics so we in hindsight take the trends out of them to the best we can so we can see what the net seasonality effects are and on a detrended basis last year showed a seasonality with less amplitude on the high side and the low side than had previously been seen pre pandemic we assumed that was probably again a manifestation of the new behaviors going in with the new tax refunds as we now have seen this tax season play out the seasonality the payment patterns have been very close to our detrended line so that we believe that we are seeing and its very plausible we are seeing a new seasonality i just want to share that with investors so later tax refunds and later and lower sort of lowered the seasonal improvement in delinquencies but we think the seasonal increase in delinquencies that we see in the capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 back half of the year likely will also be less pronounced going forward than it has been in the past all of this by the way happens in auto seasonality but in an even faster more concentrated way so what we see we felt it was a little bit noisy last quarter when we were talking to you we were finding each quarter things were coming in a little bit i mean the second derivative was still doing great things but relative to our sort of closein expectations based on seasonality things were a little bit off with the revised seasonality what we see is things very nicely settling out in card credit and we feel very good about the last couple of months that came in relative to that new seasonality curve so i think settling out is the real word from here given that from to your question about peak were not really going to were not giving really forward guidance about declarations of peak but from a seasonal point of view things should head down from here in  and then sort of pop up around october october is often a month we tend to get just little bit of an october surprise so well keep an eye on that but the other thing i just want to say about credit is our recoveries inventory is starting to rebuild and that should be a gradual tailwind to our losses over time all else being equal and then other than the economy i think the other real factor thats going to drive credit performance for us and other issuers in the next couple of years will be what is the size of this delayed chargeoff effect from the pandemic bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp and then bill with respect to the derisk comment rich just provided a lot of color on our view of losses i would just say given the accounting rules we forecast losses under a variety of scenarios and use qualitative factors for uncertainties around that and i would say therefore like we are appropriately reserved for all of that with respect to your question around repurchases ill just note our agreement with discover doesnt prohibit us from buying shares the only restriction that will need to be out of the market during the s4 proxy vote period however we are not operating under the scb as ive said in my prepared remarks and we laid out in the last q the announcement of the intention to acquire discover did constitute a material business change and therefore like we did in this recent quarter in the second quarter were subject to fed preapproval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded and so thats whats going to dictate the pace at which we repurchase until that process has concluded jeff norris a senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from don fandetti with wells fargo you may proceed donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes rich can you talk a bit about how youre seeing loan growth in auto and also as banks potentially come back in are you seeing or worried about spread or yield compression on new originations capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so hey don its an interesting thing we always seem to zag while others zig while others zag in the auto business as we discussed in the last quarter we have an optimistic outlook on the auto business were seeing a lot of success in the auto business and our investments in infrastructure are also reaping a lot of benefits for us so just on the numbers our originations grew versus last year in  and the trend continues in  with growth on a yearoveryear quarter and the loss performance has normalized and its stable we very importantly we made intervened and made an adjustment for what we felt was credit score inflation that was happening during the pandemic and so we pulled back in and by just in a sense worsening the otherwise ph score as one would see under a belief that they were artificially inflated and thats enabled our vintages all through these period of time and all through the normalization to perform very well we like the economics of the loans were originated and were very satisfied with the performance of the overall portfolio so when we think about the headwinds in the business interest rates remain high and of course that along with high vehicle values continue to pressure affordability and auto used car prices which are still high relative to historical standards they are probably in a position to gradually be coming down so well have to keep an eye on that for a long time we were concerned about the margins in the business because competitors had not passed through higher interest rates into the cost of the auto loans we pulled back quite a bit don as you remember during that period of time we have seen those margins basically return to where they were so i think thats a pretty good sign there so all things considered with a watchful eye on used car values we are seeing enhanced opportunities in the auto business with margins that have good resilience to them and quite a bit improved relative to the period where we were raising the alarm bells a bit about what was happening to the effective resilience in that business thank you donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks jeff norris a senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you and our final question this evening comes from the line of moshe orenbuch with td cowen you may proceed moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen great thanks when you talked about the increase in the reserve rate not the dollars of the reserve not the walmart piece but the reserve rate itself andrew you didnt mention like mix of receivables is it has there been any shift towards mass market or subprime from super prime within the card business capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp not in any material way that would have a significant impact on the allowance moshe moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen got it okay and just as a followup rich given whats happened with walmart and the pending discover acquisition could you talk a little about your thoughts on the partner or private label business kind of in the current environment like what are your thoughts now in terms of your existing contracts and the tendency to want to get new ones like any thoughts on that in this environment richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so thank you i think the well the walmart partnership was a very unique one that i think theres not a lot to extrapolate to other partners on that i think weve ended up in a situation there where we the loss share was a very good thing so were going to be carrying around loss rates that are something on the order of basis points higher on our portfolio for that so well have to just make sure we all see that but weve got the full economics on the business increasingly the portfolio we inherited is now very seasoned and the rest of it is the portfolio we ourselves originated so we know it well and i think that we feel very good about that so the partnership business is a very partnerbypartner business i think where people get into trouble is feeling theyve got to drive to a certain scale we all know scale matters in the credit card business and scale matters in the partnership business but heres the thing we have certainly learned over time how unique or how individual different partnerships are and weve seen great ones weve seen notsogreat ones heres moshe what we if i pull up on the patterns of what we most look for its first of all a healthy franchise a company that is itself healthy and thats certainly a good sign now the credit card business does have a pretty good default structure whereby if a partner runs into trouble and cant continue we inherit the portfolio which now walmart of course is a very strong company but were heres an example of inheriting a portfolio where i think things are going to continue very successfully there but the other thing that we really look for is what is the reason that the partner is driving this either cobrand or private label business is it to is the on one end of a continuum is its the sheer quest for profits and on the other end of the continuum it is having the card partnership at the as a centerpiece in driving a franchise and the behaviors that a partner has the incentives that get baked into programs they tend to be very driven by where on that continuum one is weve walked away from a lot of opportunities over the years where things were just too focused on the card partnership as sort of the means to drive profit for the partner more so than a way to really build the franchise but those are some of the patterns there are always exceptions to every rule but so were still very much a believer in the card partnership business but the key is were going to be selective and never knowing that its an auctionbased business thats the other thing one has to really be willing to walk away when the price isnt right so with that those are my thoughts moshe capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 jeff norris senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp thank you rich and thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call today
