young chief financial officer capital one financial corp thanks jeff and good afternoon everyone ill start on slide of tonights presentation in the fourth quarter capital one earned billion or per diluted common share for the full year capital one earned billion or per share on an adjusted basis full year earnings per share were full year rotce was included in the results for the fourth quarter was an upgrade to a legacy rewards program which increased our rewards liability and decreased noninterest income by million both periodend and average loans held for investment grew on a linkedquarter basis ending loans grew in domestic card in commercial and in consumer banking revenue in the linkedquarter increased driven by the loan growth i just described while total noninterest expense increased in the quarter driven by increases in both operating and marketing expenses provision expense in the quarter was million as net chargeoffs of million were partially offset by a modest allowance release turning to slide i will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail for the total company we released million of allowance in the fourth quarter bringing the total allowance balance to billion the total company coverage ratio now stands at turning to slide ill discuss the allowance of each of our segments in greater detail as you can see in the graph our allowance coverage ratio declined in each of our segments in domestic card the allowance balance remained flat at billion the decline in card coverage was driven by the impact of balance growth that i highlighted earlier in our consumer banking segment continued strength in auto auction values drove a decline in both the allowance balance and the coverage ratio and in commercial the decline in allowance balance was driven by modest credit improvement in the existing portfolio in addition to the allowance decline the coverage ratio was also aided by growth in lower loss segment turning to page ill now discuss liquidity you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was the lcr remained stable and continues to be well above the regulatory requirement we continue to gradually run off excess liquidity built during the pandemic relative to the prior quarter ending cash and equivalents were down about billion and investment securities were down about billion as we used our liquidity to fund loan growth and share buybacks capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 turning to page ill cover our net interest margin you can see that our fourth quarter net interest margin was basis points higher than  and basis points higher than the year ago quarter the linkedquarter increase in nim was largely driven by balance sheet mix as we had a reduction in cash and securities as well as a higher amount of card loans outside of quarterly day count effect the nim from here will largely be a function of the change in card balances cash and securities levels and interest rates turning to slide i will end by discussing our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio was at the end of the fourth quarter down basis points from the prior quarter net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases and growth in riskweighted assets we continue to estimate that our cet1 capital need is around in the fourth quarter we repurchased billion of common stock which completed our billion board authorization our board of directors has approved an additional repurchase authorization of up to billion of the companys common stock with that i will turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks andrew and good evening everyone ill begin on slide with our credit card business accelerating yearoveryear growth in purchase volume and loans coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter of credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on slide as you can see on slide our domestic card business posted strong growth in every top line metric in the fourth quarter purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up yearoveryear and up compared to the fourth quarter of the rebound in loan growth accelerated with ending loan balances up billion or about yearoveryear ending loans also grew from the sequential quarter ahead of typical seasonal growth of around ending loan growth was the result of the strong growth in purchase volume as well as the traction were getting with new account origination and line increases partially offset by continued high payment rates and revenue was up yearoveryear driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans domestic card revenue margin increased basis points yearoveryear to two factors drove most of the increase revenue margin benefited from spend velocity which is purchase volume and net interchange growth outpacing loan growth and favorable yearoveryear credit performance enabled us to recognize a higher proportion of finance charges and fees in fourth quarter revenue credit results remain strikingly strong the domestic card chargeoff rate for the quarter was a 120basis point improvement yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end was basis points better than the prior year on a linked quarter basis the chargeoff rate was up basis points and the delinquency rate was up basis points noninterest expense was up from the fourth quarter of the biggest driver of noninterest expense was an increase in marketing total company marketing expense was million in the quarter our choices in domestic card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 we continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our domestic card business and our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation we continue to lean into marketing to drive growth and build our domestic card franchise at the same time were keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment which is intensifying pulling up our domestic card business continues to deliver significant value as we invest to grow and build our franchise moving to slide strong loan growth in our consumer banking business continued in the fourth quarter driven by auto fourth quarter ending loans increased yearoveryear in the consumer banking business average loans also grew fourth quarter auto originations were up yearoveryear our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to drive yearoveryear growth in our auto business in the fourth quarter we saw a pickup in competitive intensity in the marketplace on a linked quarter basis auto originations were down fourth quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up billion or yearoveryear average deposits were up yearoveryear consumer banking revenue grew from the prior year quarter driven by growth in auto loans partially offset by declining auto loan yields noninterest expense increased yearoveryear fourth quarter provision for credit losses improved by million yearoveryear driven by an allowance release in our auto business the auto chargeoff rate and delinquency rate remains strong and wellbelow prepandemic levels on a linked quarter basis the chargeoff rate for the fourth quarter was up basis points and the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points slide shows fourth quarter results for our commercial banking business which delivered strong growth in loans deposits and revenue in the quarter fourth quarter ending loan balances were up yearoveryear driven by growth in selected industry specialties average loans were up ending deposits grew from the fourth quarter of as middle market and government customers continue to hold elevated levels of liquidity quarterly average deposits also increased yearoveryear fourth quarter revenue was up from the prior year quarter with growth in noninterest income non interest expense was up commercial credit performance remains strong in the fourth quarter the commercial banking annualized chargeoff rate was a negative basis points the criticized performing loan rate was and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was our commercial banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our commercial capability ill close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning growth momentum is evident throughout our fourth quarter results in the quarter we drove strong growth in domestic card revenue purchase volume and loan we also posted strong auto and commercial growth credit remains strikingly strong across our businesses and we continued to return capital to our shareholders as we enter we continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our businesses and build our franchise we will continue to lean into marketing to capitalize on these opportunities and drive growth for years weve talked about how sweeping digital change and modern technology are changing the game in banking last quarter i noted that the stakes are rising faster than ever before the investment flowing into fintech is breathtaking and its growing also many legacy companies are embracing the realization that capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 technology capabilities may be an existential issue for them and are increasing technology investments the war for tech talent continues to escalate which is driving up tech labor costs even before any head count increase all these developments underscore the significant opportunity for players who have modern technology and who are in a position to drive growth capital one is very wellpositioned to do that weve spent years driving our technology transformation from the bottom of the tech stack up we were an original fintech and we have built modern technology infrastructure and capabilities at scale and were investing to leverage these capabilities to grow and to realize the many benefits of our digital transformation we have been on a long journey to drive our operating efficiency ratio down we expect that the striking rise in the cost of modern tech talent on top of our growth investment will pressure annual operating efficiency in the nearterm but these pressures do not change our belief in the longer term opportunity to drive operating efficiency improvement powered by revenue growth and digital productivity gain pulling way up were living through an extraordinary time of digital change our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our growth opportunity its setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking and its the engine that drives enduring value creation over the longterm and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp thank you rich well now start the qa session as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup question and if you have followup questions after the qa investor relations team will be available after the call justin please start the qa capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question will come from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks rich i want to kind of circle back to the efficiency ratio comment that you highlighted i guess if i look at the fourth quarter its tough to know how to think about that level of expenses kind of going forward its not generally your practice to give specific guidance but it would really be helpful because in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter its not just an efficiency ratio that deteriorated its actual ppnr was down because even though revenues were quite strong the increase in expenses was more than that in dollars so is there can you talk about are there any gating factors in terms of when you think about expense levels kind of into richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp moshe sorry i was on mute there moshe there are a number of different factors going on in the fourth quarter and maybe andrew can comment specifically about the fourth quarter but we my point about efficiency is really and some of the factors that were that im talking about in the efficiency ratio certainly manifested themselves in the fourth quarter but our real point is that were on a journey to improve operating efficiency weve been leaning into this and were very optimistic about not only what weve done but what we can continue to do and were just flagging that the tech talent costs and the continued investment in the opportunity and that opportunity continues to be toward the top of the tech stack which translates more into growth opportunities probably than some years ago when our investment was began at the bottom of the tech stack these investments are very important and our point is that collectively these things will pressure annual efficiency ratio in the nearterm but its really the same journey and the same drivers of opportunity and efficiency andrew i dont know if you want to make any comments about the fourth quarter specifically andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure yeah moshe youre well aware that we seasonally typically have higher expenses in the quarter largely driven by the marginal cost of growth beyond that normal seasonal pattern there were a few things that are reflected in this fourth quarter the first of which is we saw some revenue driven and other incentive compensation we also chose to make some of the investments that rich just described in the professional services side to help accelerate some of the technology and other project work that rich is referencing that will drive future growth and so those couple of factors some of which will continue as we head into next year and were seeing a little bit of the leading edge of the wage pressures so i would expect that to accelerate a bit but some of the mark related items in incentive compensation some of the project work will likely fall off capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great maybe just as a followup just to talk specifically about marketing it was just about billion in the quarter december was the industrys largest month of mail volume in a decade so youre not alone in that although the level is fairly high maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how long do you see that and i do know that marketing was also typically high for you in the fourth quarter but was particularly low in the first half of how do we think about it as we go into jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp rich youre on mute again richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp oh shoot sorry i got to get off mute each time sorry moshe its clear that competition is intense and you can see from the one you pointed out direct mail is back at pretty high levels you can see media advertising increasing throughout of course earnings calls from card players have indicated an expectation of increasing competition and also in the rewards space you can see competitions pretty intense there so we have a very careful eye on that i would say though that even as we have a very careful eye on that i am struck by how the consumer is in a very good place right now i think theres some natural growth capacity there and im really struck by the traction that were getting at capital one we continue to see some really good origination opportunities really across our businesses and we like very much the results that were seeing and the other thing about the competitive intensity at this point is more in upfront investments such as marketing and upfront bonuses and at this point were not seeing in the competitive environment sort of the sacrifices in margin and resilience im talking particularly in the card business there so we have experience through competitive cycles and we know what to look for but we are really pleased by the results really struck by our opportunity to capitalize on them and thats why were leaning in and thats also why were flagging of course we have our eyes on the very important issue that you mentioned relative to competition jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey betsy capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp good morning betsy jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi rich i wanted to get a sense from you on the opportunity set that you have in front of you with regard to the loan growth and im asking the question because i get investor questions on hey is this revenue im sorry is this loan growth rate were seeing right now reflecting peak levels of the cycle that we could get so would rather hear from you as to what do you think about the loan growth acceleration that you got in the fourth quarter whats it being driven by in terms of new accounts versus increased line utilizations increased offers and whats the legs on this as we go into the next year thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp betsy great questions there so we feel very good about our growth and our growth opportunities that were seeing right now and the let me start with purchase volume obviously our purchase volume growth was really significant and weve seen a lot of purchase volume growth across the industry of course thats not just a capital one effect but with capital one specifically we are seeing a lot of traction in our various spender programs were optimistic about that trajectory and the loans ive been talking for quite a while about the poor loans are sort of losing out in the growth race to purchase volume and some of the other things that card issuers dont really disclose like originations of accounts the building of the franchise and that of course was driven by another kind of elephant in the room which has been the high payment rate and the so i think for a lot of players the payment rates have really muted the loan growth that includes capital one but i think whats striking what you see betsy here is that we saw still very high payment rates and you can look in our trust to see some of the electrifying levels there but still even despite that some very nice traction in the quarter on loan growth so whats driving that we in many ways this stands on the shoulders of a number of years of leaning hard into origination growth and having the balances build over time also on credit line increases we are leaning into those as well not like a big dramatic thing but i think in this environment and seeing the results were seeing we are leaning more into the credit line opportunity as well so loan growth is still going to be a hard one to predict and very affected by the payment rate parenthetically we love high payment rates because i think its a very healthy customer base an indication of a healthy consumer and we love what it does for the credit side but i think that we see the opportunity for loan growth in addition to the other growth metrics as good capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp do you have a followup betsy next question please betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc why cant they hear me jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp oh you there betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc can you hear me jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp yes richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah we can betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks just pivoting to sorry about that just pivoting to capital i saw the board authorization for billion can you give us a sense as to the timeframe that thats over and if there was a view on what drove that decision to do billion as opposed to any other number thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey betsy its andrew ill take that so we take into account a number of factors to derive these programs so as always is the case our pace for this repurchase authorization as well as the pace and amount of future authorizations are driven by a number of factors including our actual and forecasted levels of capital and earnings and growth as well as market capacity to repurchase shares and it also needs to consider the results from each unique ccar cycle which effectively happens at the midpoint of each year so we take all of those factors into account to figure out the amount and the pacing of that and so we will dynamically manage that given that we are now under scb and we have a great deal more flexibility to execute than we have previously jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 operator thank you our next question come from rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks everybody for taking my question this afternoon hey rich when we think of the factors that are contributing to the high payment rate were all aware of a lot of the economic factors one thing that weve started to wonder about is is there some sort of rule on transactions are large transactions idiosyncratic transactions getting scraped off by some of the alternative products and is that changing the composition of the book anyway in terms of payment rates richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp our large transactions getting scraped off by some of the alternative players out there thats not its not a thesis that i have explored i think that any question people are asking about are there kind of on little cat feet effects going on from the fintechs the huge investment in them and their own investment in our very business i think they are great things to look for one thing i would say about payment rates though is how broadly across the spectrum of our card business that we have seen payment rates increase over this period of time its really not seem to exist or be dominated by a particular segment lets say the top of the market or whatever its been really pretty broadbased we also ourselves have had another growth story going on beneath our growth story which is the continuing gains and growth in the heavy spender side of the business and so what we see is maybe your effect is going on but what we see if anything is particularly good growth rates over time in the heavy spender side of the business which i think is more a manifestation of our investments in the kind of products that weve been marketing for a number of years and our investment in the comprehensive experience to really win in that part of the market richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay very helpful thank you rich richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you rick jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator and our next question will come from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 thank you good evening rich i wanted to followup on your payment rate comments are you at all concerned about the normalization of credit outpacing the normalization of payment rates or would you expect those metrics to normalize together richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp well i think two things are kind of driving elevated payment rates right now and its really a funny thing payment rates ive been in this business for as you know like three decades and payment rates are just not something in general that people always talked about we would always watch them and then some years ago even before the pandemic we started noticing some elevation in payment rates but we probably more attributed that to the gradual mix change towards spenders in our own portfolio but if we talk about the two main drivers of elevated payment rates first is payment rates tend to correlate with spend levels and for obvious reasons when people are spending more theyre not going to be spending for very long unless theyre also paying to keep their opentobuy there so i think that pattern is sort of almost in a way sort of just spend and payment math and given how strong spending has been that is a important factor i think behind the payment rates and then theres the continued impact of healthy consumer balance sheets and its unmistakable the effect that while there are many factors going on just watching what happened across various segments of our business as things like government stimulus came in and what happened to payment rates its pretty clear that consumers when their balance sheets improved really used a bunch of those resources to pay down on their credit card and build more opentobuy and we have gone back and really studied the relationship between payment rates and credit throughout for the whole history of our company and the relationship is unmistakable it is also bill to your point though its not like oneforone and i think that we could certainly expect there could be some divergences there on the topic of normalization just to i will when we think about the normalization of payment rates my mind first goes to the normalization of credit and i think these record levels of low credit losses inevitably have to normalize and i think when you pull out a magnifying glass and sort of look at various metrics and things in the numbers and behind the numbers you can see the early signs of normalization that are a little bit ahead of seasonality for example thats a very natural thing probably what strikes us and kind of surprises us is how modest and moderate those are but we certainly operate with an assumption of normalization i think that so that i would expect the payment rates to follow not exactly in lockstep but i think that that should follow and so what happens for investors is a little bit of a trade at the moment the financial trade is lower payment rates lower growth of loans and really spectacular credit and as things normalize i think that gives a boost to the loan growth and but sort of is offset on the credit side of the house so the other thing thats going on at capital one because if you look at our trust data now by the way our trust and this is probably true for every player the securitization trust is not an absolutely representative sample of anybodys full portfolio but if you look at payment rates at capital one probably even in particular have just risen so significantly over this period of time and i havent looked at it lately but it wouldnt surprise me if it even rose sort of more than for a number of other competitors capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 and i think that also reflects another capital one specific thing thats going on which is the continued traction of the spending side of the business at capital one which of course manifests itself in year after year being kind of at the high end of the league tables in terms of purchase volume growth bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats super helpful rich if i could squeeze in a related followup maybe could you expand on that a little bit and discuss your confidence level in the normalization of payment rates and maybe what some of the puts and takes are to the extent that the normalization occurs a bit faster or slower richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp i again think of payment rates id just go back to the two drivers so one is the strong correlation with spend levels so one needs really an outlook for whats going to happen to purchase volume in our business and in card businesses purchase volume has an incredible strength to it right now a manifestation of the consumer some of it by the way is catching up for big pullbacks of course during the pandemic but theres real strength there if that strength continues and thats pretty plausible that would tend to have an upward boost on the payment rate and then you get to the consumer credit side of the business and i just believe gravity reverse gravity has got to pull these numbers up and we all have to understand that that normalization the word normal is a really important part of that it would be extremely normal it would be expected we are certainly managing the business to expect that but as that happens count me is betting that payment rates that that driver of payment rates is going to pull the payment rates down jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator and our next question will come from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening everyone richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp good evening ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so rich in your prepared remarks you noted that all these investments that youre making in tech and tech talent will pressure the efficiency ratio but i guess just given a followup on some of the questions from earlier the revenue backdrop is clearly much better exit run rate loan growth and i was wondering can you maybe just talk about you actually you used the phrase pressure im wondering are you actually expecting the efficiency ratio to increase and if you are maybe can you just give us some parameters on how long do you capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 expect this to last how much of an increase can we see over an intermediate timeframe and maybe what are some of the things that you and the team are doing to offset some of these pressures richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay thanks ryan so were not giving really explicit operating efficiency ratio guidance theres so many factors that go into that and you know them well what we wanted to point out is the things that we always want to share with investors the things that we see going on in our company to make sure that they understand this and the first one this tech cost im struck a lot of companies most companies are kind of waving at labor costs and i think tech labor costs are an elephant in the room and every tech company ive talked to is this is an absolute elephant in their room and i think its when you stand back and think about it thats because every company in the world pretty much these days says we really need to drive tech change and opportunities as fast as we can how long that supply and demand imbalance is going to last well have to see it is the biggest imbalance ive seen in my three decades of running this building and running this company in a labor market so that is and it may be that this is more of a headwind right now for capital one in our numbers than for some of the banks or just others and i want to savor that for a second one of the big things weve done in our tech transformation is bring inhouse engineering talent at scale and a lot of companies do a lot of outsourcing of that and but so we have built a very big engineering team and the related families there and weve built a brand and were a destination for really top tech talent and thats a wonderful thing and it really helps us on the recruiting side but i just wanted to flag that one because how long that imbalance lasts i dont know but its something that to me is very very clear the other point is on the investment side its not and i really want to say it its not like were just going along do our tech doing our tech transformation and looking at the market and say oh my gosh we have to just massively invest in ways like we werent before thats not really what im saying what im saying is that we are continuing to move up the tech stack in terms of where our investments are and thats a wonderful thing because the closer you get to the consumer and the top of the tech stack the more of those opportunities directly can be capitalized in the marketplace so thats a good thing and weve been investing for a long time my point is that we are still really leaning into this opportunity because the opportunity the timeframes the imperative is real and already whats driving a lot of the growth that youre seeing is the benefits of those things and its what will drive a lot of the future growth as a company so back to your question while were not giving explicit efficiency ratio guidance the use of the word pressure is to explain those two phenomena that are going on that i wanted to share with investors that are real and that pressures the efficiency ratio exactly what number would come out in the end depends in the end on a lot of things and revenue growth and things but i just wanted to share that and i made the same comment in the call the quarter before so ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc if i capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp and yes go ahead ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc no finish your thought i have a ill followup richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp no no no go for it ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc i was going to say as a followup to moshes question on marketing i understand the thought that youre leaning in and were obviously seeing really really good traction on the growth side but if i think about the competitive intensity weve heard amex saying that marketings going to come down a little discoverys growing jpmorgans accelerating and i think all of us are just looking for some parameters to maybe understand where you are in the stage of investment and maybe can you just help us understand are we at run rate levels in the back half of the year do you see another stepup and just any color that you could provide on how youre thinking about the pace of marketing spend i think would be helpful richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah ryan it is striking the comments that everyones making about this and probably a little bewildering for investors to understand where equilibrium is these days you know our philosophy ryan you and i have known each other for a long time we dont really start the year by saying this is precisely the marketing i mean we always make a budget but we dont start the year and say well this is what everybody has in marketing dollars no matter what sometimes we contract what we put in there sometimes we expand it but its very focused on whats the nature of the opportunity we also have a strong belief that there are windows of opportunity for growth and you capitalize on those when you get them or those windows pass and so that doesnt also lend itself to the kind of lets go and just allocate the same marketing budget every quarter to different parts of our business or anything like that so what we do at capital one is when we see opportunities we really lean into them i cant in advance tell you quite how far we lean into them because we really look at whats the productivity at the margin for what we are investing and we look at marketing efficiency on average we look at it at the margin we look at it in all of our programs and of course also we look at our brand investments and the other things that were doing to lift the boat my message to you here is really two points one this is a leanin time and were going to continue to do that to the extent that the opportunity is there and you can see the fourth quarter was a pretty high level of leanin so that would be an example of that my other point is we are as closely as you watching the competition and the choices theyre making and higher levels of competition themselves can manifest in different ways it can affect the ability to generate response it capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 can affect pricing it can affect the worst thing is when it starts making its way into underwriting practices and starts affecting the credit side of the business but right now if i pull way up on the marketplace weve got a strong consume where kind of everybodys sort of roaring out of the sort of pandemic not society necessarily when im talking about many of the metrics here and the marketplace is still generating this opportunity resiliently and we are leaning into that jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question will come from sanjay sakhrani and again go ahead sir richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah hey sanjay sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey hows it going so maybe just to ask ryans question a little bit differently i mean shouldnt we expect revenue growth to be above average given these accelerated investments youre making maybe you could just give us a sense of what kind of revenue growth youre targeting and what some of the specific products might be that youre rolling out that are sort of unique and separate yourself from the peers im just thinking about buying now pay later like where are we with the product rollout thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay so were not giving specific revenue guidance we are commenting and pleased with the momentum that we have and particularly momentum you saw that picked up in the fourth quarter and we certainly hope to keep our momentum going there so i think on the purchase volume side theres a lot of thrust were very pleased with the account originations that we have been able to generate from the enhanced marketing that were doing and the loan growth which is a very important part of the revenue growth that one is always the kind of the hardest one to sort of predict because of its linkage to the payment rate but we do see a good trajectory there were not giving specific guidance but we like what we see there in terms of what is driving the growth i dont think youll occasionally see capital one on tv with a new product or whatever we are always coming up with new products so is competition by the way our surge in growth is not the result of some new product there thats suddenly driving this this is the result of many things coming together working particularly well right now i think a lot of it is really driven by opportunities and capabilities and expansion and experiences for the customer that stand on the shoulders of our tech transformation so were hopeful we can continue to drive some strong growth were not giving guidance on that but we and the biggest i think question will be how what happens to payment rates and what that does to loan growth capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and maybe just another followup on expenses im sorry im asking the same questions everyone else is but when we think rich you seem to think that the work for sort of inflationary pressure is transitory is that the only risk in terms of getting back to sort of that operating efficiency ratio so that sort of passes at some point you guys can get back there or is there something else too richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so we are still driving toward the same destination for operating efficiency improvement but the timing that needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace and particularly the one we flagged here more recently the striking rise in the cost of modern tech talent the investment imperatives of the marketplace and the rising cost of tech talent will pressure our operating efficiency ratio in the nearterm as we have discussed but modern technology capabilities are the engine that drives revenue growth and digital productivity gains and the investments were making today are the drivers of the efficiency improvements that we expect to continue to get over time so were not in a position to declare the timing of operating efficiency destinations its the same journey the same engine powering it there are some pressures we shared with you in the nearer term but its the same journey and delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be one of the important payoffs of our technology journey and a key element of delivering longterm shareholder value jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator and our next question will come from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good evening ill shift gears a little bit but i do also agree it would be helpful to have some kind of sizing around the expenses just given the environment you have a really good story to tell outside of that i guess on auto lending are you signaling that you might moderate a little bit of growth there and the auto navigator product which i think is really benefiting from the public cloud are you getting penetration on that and can you size that richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes don the auto business has really been growing strongly and for starters thats very importantly an industry point a lot of factors have aligned to create a lot of demand a lot of demand for used cars high used cars car valuations and the its certainly been for us and really for the industry a bit of one of our strongest periods in history but if we look beneath that because obviously all those things normalize over time we continue to leverage our leading technology our data and underwriting capabilities to identify market opportunities that we think have attractive and resilient riskadjusted returns and by the way a very important capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 part of that is keeping an eye on the a very high used car prices and as we underwrite assuming a significant decline in those so we dont count on something that not going to be longterm sustainable whether the industry fully does that well have to see our technology journey and you mentioned the auto navigator product thats a manifestation of a lot of the technology weve built in the auto business has really helped us not only deepen our relationship with consumers but also with dealers because auto navigator is a winning product for dealers as well as it is for consumers because its bringing in consumers whove already done a lot of the work to prequalify themselves and its the highest quality lead like a dealer can have so were not giving out data on the success of auto navigator but we believe that it is a powerful product and ive often said to investors hey if you want to look at it as an example and go kind of see the differentiation that capital one has created in a techbased informationbased machine learningbased product the auto navigator and the realtime underwriting of any car on any lot in america in less than a second is a manifestation of that and that is getting traction but i do want to say that there are lot of changes going on in the lot of in the auto industry a number of competitors working hard to reinvent how car buying works and i think for capital one and a lot of players who are on the frontier of some of those changes i think there is opportunity for us and i think a lot of some of the success in auto is exactly a manifestation of that let me tell you one other thing though with respect to growth in the auto business ive always said that the auto business is even more sensitive to competition than the credit card business is because of the role that a dealer plays between the consumer and the lender in holding an auction and so the dealers understandably really tend to drive their business toward the lender who is the most flexible on pricing and terms and that we have seen some of those metrics move in the last quarter and i think a very robust auto market its a natural thing to expect that competition might overheat and pricing and practices could be affected along the way so were i dont want to overstate my point its a caution that i put out there but we are still leaning into our opportunity but the bit of the volume decline in the fourth quarter i think was a competitive effect of the very thing were talking about donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp don you have a followup donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc no jeff im all set richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks don capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp thanks don next question please operator thank you our next question will come from john hecht with jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc afternoon guys thanks very much i guess im interested in maybe talking through the mechanics of your net interest margin obviously i want to hear your thoughts on what maybe each rate hike might do to the margin but beyond that then theres a lot of other moving factors like youre going to get some suppression of yield with the evolution of npas youre going to get some late fees to offset that and so on and so forth so maybe can you give us a sense of what to expect as all those factors come to play in the next few months andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure john its andrew and maybe ill expand the horizon beyond the next few months because itll take a while for some of the factors that you just described to play out but why dont i start with the rate side of the equation that you brought up our current balance sheet is asset sensitive so as rates move up will clearly be a tailwind to nii at this point while its moved a fair amount over the last few months including i think about a basis point retraction over the last week in the 10year so its a volatile number but the market is currently last time i checked at least expecting around four hikes in and so that equates to an average fed fund rates thats about basis points higher for the full year and you can get a directional indication of the impact of that in our  disclosures i think we showed that relative to forwards the basis point shock impacts the next months of nii by i believe is the number so thats just roughly under million so thats the dollar effective rates if you translate the dollar effects into nim to the other side of your question of the three big factors that are ultimately going to impact nim are the three things that i highlighted in my talking points and that is just the quantum of card balances even though some of the factors you described will potentially impact card margin its much more about the card balances to the overall company nim the other is cash and securities which you saw we had an investment portfolio at billion at its peak was probably something like billion higher than what is a more normal level and cash levels that were also really high so you could see cash and securities coming down which all else equal benefit nim and then finally the rate effect that i just described so really those are the three things that were primarily looking at and will ultimately have the biggest effect on nim on a run rate basis in terms of the next few months the only thing that i know for sure is theres two fewer days in the first quarter so thats roughly a basis point headwind to nim all else equal but the other effects are really whats going to drive the nim over the longer term john hecht q analyst jefferies llc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 thats great really appreciate that detail i guess an unrelated followup is it seems like you guys have put out a lot of products over the past several quarters that maybe targeting some of the fintechs and neobanks you dont have i think youve canceled overdraft protection or moderated that youve got early payment mechanisms youve got direct auto type products i guess the question is are you able to quantify how that impacts your customer base are you able do you get good crosssell does it affect retention rates or generally speaking how do these compete against these new banks that are trying to i guess disrupt the overall system richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah john well i love the focus that investors have on fintechs and lets talk about the reasons for that first of all i think the investors are voting with their feet to just the amount of money that is poured into fintechs on the venture capital side the valuation of fintechs although the last little bit has been rough for them really speaks to a belief i think in the investor community that banking is going to be transformed and the fintechs are going to be important drivers of making that happen and we were an original fintech so i maybe i have a soft spot in my heart for fintechs and also an understanding of the challenges they face as well but one thing is start with one thing is very clear fintech start with modern technology everybody starts in the cloud they dont have all the scale technology you need they got to build a lot of things and they but they start in the cloud theres also another phenomenon going on and that is that one of the most successful parts of fintech has been the platform companies building the shoulders for other fintechs to then stand on and build their business so the ability to enter businesses and move quickly and have modern technology is really striking the fintechs are also unregulated so theres a whole vector there in terms of some of the things theyre doing and some of the ways that they move and operate that wouldnt be consistent with the banking side of the business but i savor all that because i believe also as do so many investors beating a path into this space that banking is absolutely in the process of being transformed and its kind of striking the industry has taken as long as it has to be as transformed relative to a lot of other industries and i think a big reason for it is the regulation that has tended to surround the banking space interestingly by far the biggest growth vectors have been sort of in the least regulated side of things in payments and platforms and crypto and i think those the almost unmitigated success of companies in those space are really striking but let me now go back to capital one and i say this as an original fintech and a fintech that really transformed itself into and became one of americas biggest banks we are building a essentially a fintech and we have built a fintech at scale we dont have some of the benefits that the fintechs have we have a lot of benefits a lot of fintechs dont have including a gigantic customer base and national brand a decades of underwriting experience an unbelievable amount of data that we have collected and the and have through our tech transformation built a very sophisticated kind of comprehensive way to manage big data and machine learning in real time to create opportunities to be at the forefront of how banking is being transformed capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 we as a bank face our own unique set of challenges fintechs dont have fintechs face a lot of challenges they have but its not an accident that you noticed capital one out there with a number of products and even a bit of a brand personality consistent with where fintechs are because we are leaning into the opportunities some opportunities of the same ones the fintechs are some are ones that are were creating in places they are not but when you hear an optimism in my voice and an excitement it relates to standing on the shoulders of our tech transformation and the scale and market position we have as a company to create opportunities that i think capital ones uniquely positioned to do it its a tough journey it requires continued investment which we talked about and its not easy but i really like our chances and i think capital one is ideally positioned to take advantage of the accelerating transformation in banking jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator and our last question will come from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good evening on the andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey john richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey good evening john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the credit good evening on the credit front i just wanted to see if you can give a little bit of color on the increase in chargeoffs and delinquencies and on the noncard consumer businesses i know you mentioned auto just wanted to see if you can give a little bit more granularity on the drivers there and then also on the reserve side another sizable reserve release as youre looking forward here and as loans begin to strengthen in terms of the balance sheet do you expect ultimately to begin matching or building reserves here in the coming quarters richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay john let me talk about credit andrew will do the reserve question so the consumer credit just remains strikingly strong i mean in all our in all my years ive never seen anything quite like what we have been through with consumer credit in the last couple of years and its still strikingly strong we of course have been saying all through this normalization is bound to happen how fast and it does and at what trajectory well have to see capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 in the fourth quarter our card losses were up on a quarteroverquarter basis they were up basis points which is consistent with normal seasonal trends our card delinquencies increased basis points and that increase is a bit more than the normal seasonal trend and i would point at that as an indicator of more likely than not early signs of some normalization off of a very very low base of course in the auto business lets talk about credit performance there auto credit performance has been strikingly strong through the pandemic fourth quarter losses were just basis points and thats roughly a third of what they were before the pandemic in addition to all the positives that have supported consumer credit in general like you see in our card business auto is seeing exceptionally strong recoveries supported by recordhigh vehicle values and this was enough to push losses negative earlier in and obviously thats not sustainable but by any measure losses remain exceptionally low the quarteroverquarter increase in  was largely a normal seasonality auto vehicle values remain about above prepandemic levels backed by strong consumer demand and ongoing supply constraints so we certainly would expect auto losses to increase from current levels even if the health of the consumer remains strong especially because auction prices should normalize over time as supply constraints are resolved so its an amazing period that were in and we are trying to lean in and capitalize on the opportunities to grow the business with the strength the consumer has and the capacity to grow their own balance sheet and we are especially watchful of the natural things that can happen to credit at a time like this im talking about the industry and let me just name two there one is of course the natural things like more aggressive marketing and in the auto business more aggressive practices with the dealers and things like this theres also just one other thing well all have to keep an eye on and that is when we think about any of us and we ask ourselves this question but i think were in a stronger position to answer it than maybe many but when one is doing credit underwriting how do you build models what are your models supposed to be looking at when they look in the rearview mirror and see the best credit in the history of these businesses and so capital one has a very long kind of history of data on consumers and we very much point our models to a longer horizon there but i do worry especially for the fintechs who are building their own companies from scratch exactly whats the rearview mirror and whats the underwriting the informationbased underwriting capabilities that can be built here so well just keep an eye out for those effects and expect normalization to occur and take advantage of the opportunities while theyre in front of us andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp and then john with respect to richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp and andrew yes richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes yes john with respect to the allowance unfortunately i dont have an easy yesno answer for you around allowance releases so let me just start by describing the current allowance because i think that backdrop will be capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 helpful in just painting various pictures of how the coming quarters might unfold in that way you have as much knowledge as we do so when we think about the composition of the allowance the first thing is just our expectation of future losses and recoveries and so right now our outlook assumes relatively swift normalization of losses from todays unusually strong levels the second factor is just qualitative factors which weve described before and today these qualitative factors remain elevated to account for the remaining uncertainties around the pandemic and the economy and this is why our coverage ratios remain high and then the last factor is just the size of the balance sheet at each successive quarter and so keep in mind that under cecl allowance impacts of new growth is pulled forward so it definitely adds to the quantum of allowance that we need as we grow but future allowance movements from where we are today will just be determined by how all of these affects net out and so if normalization plays out and we continue to grow at a significant clip we could see allowance builds over the next few quarters the other scenario could be and clearly theres many scenarios but another scenario is favorable credit trends continue the uncertainties that drive the qualitative factors subside and growth is a little bit more modest than we would likely see further allowance releases so i just wanted to give you a window into all of the pieces that go into the calculation and well go through a rigorous process every quarter and well see how it ultimately plays out over the year john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thank you thats very helpful and then just lastly can you just maybe comment a bit on the commercial loan growth trends youre seeing i know your commercial segment loans were up double digits yearoveryear so i just want a quick a bit of color on the drivers there thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah john our commercial loan growth was quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear and normalizing for and it outpaced industry growth normalizing for ppp forgiveness were much more in line with the growth of our peers while we did see a slight increase in our revolver utilization this quarter our growth was almost entirely driven by originations in our specialty businesses where we generate strong riskadjusted returns and of course just the other thing i would point out of course is our activity in commercial reflects the increased economic activity and a quite attractive market quite attractive lending conditions in so its been i think a good time for all commercial lenders this is in the context of actually a market that still we have a very cautious eye looking at with the tremendous growth of nonbank lenders and the and some of the lending practices that are happening outside the banking industry that make their way into our customers so i think its a great period at the moment we continue to be cautious about the opportunity in the context of the bigger marketplace but thanks very much john jeff norris senior vice presidentglobal finance
