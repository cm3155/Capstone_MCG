table end each of our business segments operates in a highly competitive environment and we face competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and nonbank providers of financial services our credit card business competes with international national regional and local issuers of visa and mastercard credit cards as well as with american express discover card privatelabel card brands and to a certain extent issuers of debit cards in general customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price credit limit reward programs and other product features our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses compete with national state and direct banks for deposits commercial and auto loans as well as with savings and loan associations and credit unions for loans and deposits our competitors also include automotive finance companies commercial mortgage banking companies and other financial services providers that provide loans deposits and other similar services and products in addition we compete against nondepository institutions that are able to offer these products and services securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties in addition competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to rapidly deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors our businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services transaction execution innovation and price competition varies based on the types of clients customers industries and geographies served our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to attract and retain our associates and on our reputation there can be no assurance however that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate returns on our products and services will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop or by the broader economic

further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines see mda capital management mda liquidity risk profile and note 11regulatory and capital adequacy basel iii and united states capital rules the federal reserve occ and fdic collectively the federal banking agencies have issued regulations basel iii capital rule that implement certain capital and liquidity requirements published by the basel committee on banking supervision basel committee along with certain doddfrank act and other capital provisions the basel iii capital rule includes the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches prior to january the basel iii advanced approaches were mandatory for institutions with total consolidated assets of billion or more or total consolidated onbalance sheet foreign exposure of billion or more the basel iii capital rule revised the definition of regulatory capital established a new common equity tier capital requirement set higher minimum capital ratio requirements and introduced a capital conservation buffer of a supplementary leverage ratio of and a countercyclical capital buffer currently set at compliance with the basel iii capital rule went into effect for capital one beginning on january with certain provisions becoming effective later according to various start dates and phasein periods that ended january in october the federal banking agencies amended the basel iii capital rule to provide for tailored application of certain capital requirements across different categories of banking institutions tailoring rules these categories are determined primarily by an institutions asset size with adjustments to a more stringent category possible if the institution exceeds certain table start capital one financial corporation cof table end other riskbased thresholds as a bhc with total consolidated assets of at least billion that does not exceed any of the applicable riskbased thresholds we are a category iii institution under the tailoring rules therefore we are no longer subject to the basel iii advanced approaches and certain associated capital requirements such as the requirement to include in regulatory capital certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci although we will remain subject to the countercyclical capital buffer and supplementary leverage ratio which were previously required only for basel iii advanced approaches institutions in july the federal banking agencies finalized certain changes to the basel iii capital rule for institutions not subject to the basel iii advanced approaches including capital one capital simplification rule these changes effective january generally raise the threshold above which covered institutions must deduct certain assets from their common equity tier capital including certain deferred tax assets mortgage servicing assets and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions we anticipate that the tailoring rules and capital simplification rule will taken together decrease our capital requirements global systemically important banks gsibs that are based in the us are subject to an additional common equity tier capital requirement gsib surcharge we are not a gsib based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a gsib surcharge in december the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to address regulatory capital treatment of credit loss allowances under the current expected credit loss cecl model the cecl model became applicable to capital one as of january the rule cecl capital rule revises the federal banking agencies regulatory capital rules to identify which credit loss allowances under the cecl model are eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital and to provide banking organizations the option to phase in over a threeyear transition period ending january the dayone adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the cecl model cecl transition election we intend to make the cecl transition election beginning in the first quarter of market risk rule the market risk rule supplements the basel iii capital rule by requiring institutions subject to the market risk rule to adjust their riskbased capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios the market risk rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to the lesser of table start or more of total assets or table endtable start billion or more table end as of december the company and cona are subject to the market risk rule see mda market risk profile below for additional information basel iii and united states liquidity rules the basel committee has published a liquidity framework that includes two standards for liquidity risk supervision one standard the liquidity coverage ratio lcr seeks to promote shortterm resilience by requiring organizations to hold sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a stress scenario lasting for days the other standard the net stable funding ratio nsfr seeks to promote longerterm resilience by requiring sufficient stable funding over a oneyear period based on the liquidity characteristics of its assets and activities the company and the banks are subject to the lcr as implemented by the federal reserve and occ lcr rule the lcr rule requires the company and each of the banks to hold an amount of eligible highquality liquid assets hqla that equals or exceeds of their respective projected adjusted net cash outflows over a 30day period each as calculated in accordance with the lcr rule the lcr rule requires us to calculate the lcr daily in addition the company is required to make quarterly public disclosures of its lcr and certain related quantitative liquidity metrics along with a qualitative discussion of its lcr under the tailoring rules as a category iii institution with less than billion in weighted average shortterm wholesale funding the companys and the banks total net cash outflows are multiplied by an outflow adjustment percentage of we expect this outflow adjustment to materially increase the lcr for the banks but not for the company the lcr rule restricts the amount of hqla held at the banks in excess of the banks total net cash outflow amount that can be included in the companys hqla amount referred to as trapped liquidity therefore although we typically manage banklevel lcrs at a level well above the regulatory minimum of the amount of trapped liquidity will also increase as the banks total net cash outflows are reduced table start capital one financial corporation cof table end by the factor that increase in trapped liquidity will prevent the companys lcr from materially changing as a result of the tailoring rules in april the federal banking agencies issued an interagency notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the us implementation of the basel iii nsfr proposed nsfr which would apply to the same institutions subject to the lcr rule the proposed nsfr would require us to maintain a sufficient amount of stable funding in relation to our assets derivatives exposures and commitments over a oneyear horizon period although the proposed nsfr is generally consistent with the basel nsfr standard it is more stringent in certain areas the financial and operational impact on us of a final nsfr rule remains uncertain until a final rule is published there is uncertainty regarding the timing and form of any such final rule fdicia and prompt corrective action the fdicia requires the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action for banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements the fdicia establishes five capital ratio levels well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized the three undercapitalized categories are based upon the amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to an adequately capitalized institution the capital categories are determined solely for purposes of applying the fdicias prompt corrective action pca provisions and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the banks overall financial condition or prospects the basel iii capital rule updated the pca framework to reflect new higher regulatory capital minimums for an insured depository institution to be well capitalized it must maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of or more a tier capital ratio of or more a common equity tier capital ratio of or more and a leverage ratio of or more an adequately capitalized depository institution must maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of or more a tier capital ratio of or more a common equity tier capital ratio of or more a leverage ratio of or more and for category iii and certain other institutions under the tailoring rules a supplementary leverage ratio of or more the pca provisions also authorize the federal banking agencies to reclassify a banks capital category or take other action against banks that are determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or to have engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the fdicia required the federal banking agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards the standards adopted by the federal banking agencies relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure and executive compensation the federal banking agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards enhanced prudential standards and other requirements under the doddfrank act we are a covered company subject under the doddfrank act to certain enhanced prudential standards including requirements that may be recommended by the financial stability oversight council fsoc and implemented by the federal reserve and other regulators we remain a covered company under the amendments to the doddfrank act made by the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act egrrcpa which provided reduced enhanced prudential standards for institutions with less than billion in assets as a result we are subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable to institutions that are not covered companies the fsoc may also issue recommendations to the federal reserve or other primary financial regulatory agencies to apply new or enhanced standards to certain financial activities or practices the federal reserve and fdic have issued rules requiring the company to implement resolution planning for orderly resolution in the event the covered company faces material financial distress or failure the fdic issued similar rules regarding resolution planning applicable to the banks in addition the occ has issued rules requiring banks with assets of billion or more to develop recovery plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or operational stress but have not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent the federal reserve established a rule that implements the requirement in the doddfrank act that the federal reserve conduct annual stress tests on the capacity of our capital to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions this rule also requires the company to conduct its own stress tests and publish the results of the stress tests on our website or other public forum as a category iii institution under the tailoring rules the company must disclose the results of its companyrun stress test in and every two years thereafter the occ has adopted a similar stress test rule requiring banks with at least billion in assets including cona to conduct their own companyrun stress tests under that occ rule cona must disclose the results of this stress test in and every two years thereafter table start capital one financial corporation cof table end the federal reserve also established rules implementing other aspects of the enhanced prudential standards under the doddfrank act enhanced standards rule under the enhanced standards rule the company must meet liquidity risk management standards conduct internal liquidity stress tests and maintain a 30day buffer of highly liquid assets in each case consistent with the requirements of the enhanced standards rule these requirements are in addition to the lcr discussed above in basel iii and united states liquidity rules the enhanced standards rule also requires that the company comply with and hold capital commensurate with the requirements of any regulations adopted by the federal reserve relating to capital planning and stress tests stress testing and capital planning regulations are discussed further below under dividends stock repurchases and transfers of funds the enhanced standards rule also requires that the company establish and maintain an enterprisewide risk management framework that includes a risk committee and a chief risk officer although not a requirement of the doddfrank act the occ established regulatory guidelines heightened standards guidelines that apply heightened standards for risk management to large institutions subject to its supervision including the banks the heightened standards guidelines establish standards for the development and implementation by the banks of a risk governance framework investment in the company and the banks certain acquisitions of our capital stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal or state law investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not directly or indirectly acquire shares of our capital stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval including under the bhc act and the change in bank control act cibc act federal law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of the company or the banks without in most cases prior written approval of the federal reserve or the occ as applicable control exists if among other things a person or company acquires more than of any class of our voting stock or otherwise has a controlling influence over us for a publicly traded bhc such as ourselves a rebuttable presumption of control arises under the cibc act if a person or company acquires more than of any class of our voting stock additionally cobna and cona are banks within the

to as comprehensive capital analysis and review or ccar covered bhcs including ourselves must submit a capital plan to the federal reserve on an annual basis that contains a description of all planned capital actions including dividends or stock repurchases over a ninequarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted ccar cycle a covered bhc may take the proposed capital actions if the federal reserve does not object to the plan doddfrank act stress testing described above in enhanced prudential standards and other requirements under the doddfrank act is a complementary exercise to ccar it is a forwardlooking exercise conducted by the federal reserve and covered financial companies to help assess whether a company has sufficient capital to absorb losses and support operations during adverse economic conditions the supervisory stress test after incorporating a firms planned capital actions is used for quantitative assessment in ccar the company must file its capital plan and stress testing results with the federal reserve by april of each year unless the federal reserve designates a later date using data as of the end of the prior calendar year the federal reserve is expected to provide its objection or nonobjection to that capital plan in june of that year the federal reserves objection or nonobjection applies to planned capital actions from the third quarter of the year the capital plan is submitted through the end of the second quarter of the following year the company along with other bhcs subject to the supplementary leverage ratio must incorporate an estimate of its supplementary leverage ratio into its capital plan and stress tests the current capital planning and stress testing rules place supervisory focus on quarterly capital issuances and distributions by establishing a cumulative net distribution requirement under a de minimis exception if a company does not receive an objection to its capital plan it may in certain cases distribute up to of its tier capital above the distributions in its capital plan with certain limited exceptions to the extent a bhc does not issue the amount of a given class of regulatory capital instrument that it table start capital one financial corporation cof table end projected in its capital plan as measured on an aggregate basis beginning in the third quarter of the planning horizon the bhc must reduce its capital distributions in december the federal reserve announced that it will maintain its prececl framework for calculating allowances on loans in the supervisory stress test for the and supervisory stress testing cycles until the impact of cecl is better known and understood the federal reserve stated further that although bank holding companies required to perform companyrun stress tests will be required to incorporate cecl into those stress tests starting in the cycle it will not issue supervisory findings on those firms allowance estimations in the ccar exercise through in april the federal reserve issued a proposed rule stress capital buffer proposed rule that would implement a firmspecific stress capital buffer requirement and a stress leverage buffer requirement the federal reserve described the stress capital buffer proposed rule as designed to simplify the agencys regulatory regime by integrating the supervisory stress tests with its nonstress capital rules under the stress capital buffer proposed rule a firms stress capital buffer would have a floor of of total riskweighted assets replacing the existing capital conservation buffer and would equal as a percentage of total riskweighted assets the sum of i the difference between a firms starting common equity tier capital ratio and the low point under the severely adverse scenario of the federal reserves supervisory stress test plus ii the ratio of the firms projected four quarters of common stock dividends to riskweighted assets as projected under ccar for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon a firms new standardized approach capital conservation buffer would include its stress capital buffer any gsib surcharge not applicable to us and any applicable countercyclical capital buffer currently set at zero the consequences of breaching the stress capital buffer requirement would be consistent with the current capital conservation buffer framework and would result in increasingly strict limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments the stress capital buffer proposed rule would replace the current ccar poststress leverage ratio requirement with a stress leverage buffer requirement additionally the proposal would modify certain ccar assumptions relating to balance sheet growth prefunding of dividends and capital distributions it is not clear which of these changes if any will be finalized and when they would go into effect historically dividends from the companys direct and indirect subsidiaries have represented a major source of the funds we have used to pay dividends on our stock make payments on corporate debt securities and meet our other obligations there are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans these limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus provisions of sections and of the federal reserve act and regulation w governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices in general federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit insured depository institutions such as the banks from making dividend distributions without first obtaining regulatory approval if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would
