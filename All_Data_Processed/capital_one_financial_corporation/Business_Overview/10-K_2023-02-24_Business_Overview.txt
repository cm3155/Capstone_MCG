their products and services transaction execution innovation and price competition varies based on the types of clients customers industries and geographies served our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to attract and retain our associates and on our reputation as well as our ability to keep pace with innovation in particular in the development of new technology platforms there

each of the company and the bank to calculate its respective lcr daily in addition the company is required to make quarterly public disclosures of its lcr and certain related quantitative liquidity metrics along with a qualitative discussion of its lcr as a category iii institution with less than billion in weighted average shortterm wholesale funding the companys and the banks total net cash outflows are multiplied by an outflow adjustment percentage of although the bank may hold more hqla than it needs to meet its lcr requirements the lcr rule restricts the amount of such excess hqla held at the bank referred to as trapped liquidity that can be included in the companys hqla amount because we typically manage the banks lcr to levels well above the result is additional trapped liquidity as the banks net cash outflows are reduced by the outflow adjustment percentage of the nsfr rule requires the company and the bank to maintain an amount of available stable funding which is a weighted measure of a companys funding sources over a oneyear time horizon calculated by applying standardized weightings to equity and liabilities based on their expected stability that is no less than a specified percentage of its required stable funding which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics as a category iii institution the company and the bank are each required to maintain available stable funding in an amount at least equal to of its required stable funding the nsfr

or enhanced standards to certain financial activities or practices as part of the enhanced prudential standards the company is required to implement resolution planning for orderly resolution in the event it faces material financial distress or failure the fdic issued similar rules regarding resolution planning applicable to the bank in addition the occ has issued rules requiring banks with assets of billion or more to develop recovery plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or operational stress but have not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent the enhanced prudential standards also include supervisory and companyrun stress testing requirements also known as the dfast stress testing requirements in particular the federal reserve is required to conduct annual stress tests on certain covered companies including us to ensure that the covered companies have sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue operations during adverse economic conditions as well as to determine the companys stress capital buffer requirement as described above as a category iii institution we are also required to conduct our own stress tests and publish the results of such tests on our website or other public forum the company must disclose the results of its companyrun stress test on a biennial basis the occ has adopted a similar stress test rule requiring banks with at least billion in assets including the bank to conduct their own companyrun stress tests under that occ rule the bank must also disclose the results of its stress test on a biennial basis in addition the company is required to meet liquidity risk management standards conduct internal liquidity stress tests and maintain a 30day buffer of highly liquid assets in each case consistent with the requirements of the enhanced prudential standards these requirements are in addition to the lcr and nsfr rules discussed above in basel iii and united states liquidity rules the enhanced prudential standards also require that the company comply with and hold capital commensurate with the requirements of any regulations adopted by the federal reserve relating to capital planning and stress tests stress testing and capital planning regulations are discussed further below under dividends stock repurchases

capital plan is submitted ccar cycle the dfast stress testing requirements described above in enhanced prudential standards and other related requirements is a complementary exercise to ccar it is a forwardlooking exercise conducted by the federal reserve and each covered company to help assess whether a company has sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue operations during adverse economic conditions pursuant to the capital planning rules the company must file its capital plan with the federal reserve by april of each year unless the federal reserve designates a later date using data as of the end of the prior calendar year the federal reserve will release the results of the supervisory stress test and notify the company of its stress capital buffer requirement by june of that year the company will have two business days from receipt of its stress capital buffer requirement to make any necessary adjustments to its planned capital distributions the federal reserve will then finalize the stress capital buffer requirement for the company and confirm the companys planned capital distributions by august of that year the companys final stress capital buffer requirement will be effective from the fourth quarter of the year the capital plan is submitted through the third quarter of the following year the company may make the planned capital distributions
