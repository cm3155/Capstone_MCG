addition to the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis we review and assess our estimate of expected losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable which are generally in our commercial banking business the factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for credit losses for the commercial banking business the reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and changes to it are recorded through the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income table start capital one financial corporation cof table end although we examine a variety of externally available data as well as our internal loan performance data to determine our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance as well as economic forecasts that may not align with actual future economic conditions accordingly our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in

reserve for unfunded lending commitments goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date goodwill totaled billion and billion as of december and respectively we did not recognize any goodwill impairment in or see item financial statements and supplementary datanote 6goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information we perform our goodwill impairment test annually on october at a reporting unit level we are also required to test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate it is morelikelythannot that an impairment may have occurred an impairment of a reporting units goodwill is determined based on the amount by which the reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit we have four reporting units credit card auto finance other consumer banking and commercial banking for the purpose of our goodwill impairment testing we calculate the carrying amount of a reporting unit using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting units specific regulatory capital requirements economic capital requirements and underlying risks the carrying amount for a reporting unit is the sum of its respective capital requirements goodwill and other intangibles balances consolidated stockholders equity in excess of the sum of all reporting units capital requirements that is not identified for future capital needs such as dividends share buybacks or other strategic initiatives is allocated to the reporting units and the other category and assumed to be distributed to equity holders in future periods determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that requires the use of estimates and the exercise of significant judgment we calculate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow dcf calculation a form of the income approach this dcf calculation uses projected cash flows based on each reporting units internal forecast and the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values our dcf calculation requires management to make estimates about future loan deposit and revenue growth as well as credit losses and capital rates these cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using discount rates based on our external cost of capital with adjustments for the risk inherent in each reporting unit discount rates used for our reporting units ranged from to and we applied a terminal year longterm growth rate of to all reporting units the reasonableness of our dcf calculation is assessed by reference to a marketbased approach using comparable market multiples and recent market transactions where available the usefulness of market data is inherently limited due to the size and scope of our operations compared to most peer institutions and recent market transactions the results of the annual impairment test indicated that the estimated fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by between and we also compare the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization our assessment considers the level of premium expected to assume control of the company in a market transaction including anticipated cost savings and other synergies that would be realized in a hypothetical transaction the results of the annual goodwill impairment test for our commercial banking reporting unit concluded that while the estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount the percentage by which the estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount had decreased to from in the annual impairment test the assumptions leveraged in the valuation of each reporting unit including the commercial banking reporting unit and the related risk of changes in those assumptions are described further below assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain a change in the economic conditions of a reporting unit such as declines in business performance as a result of industry or macroeconomic trends or changes in our strategy adverse impacts to loan or deposit growth trends decreases in revenue increases in expenses table start capital one financial corporation cof table end deterioration in a significant loan portfolio increases in credit losses increases in capital requirements deterioration of market conditions declines in longterm growth expectations an increase in disposition activity adverse impacts of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of capital could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units to decline in the future and increase the risk of a goodwill impairment in a future period we perform sensitivity analyses around certain assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values we have a governance framework supported by processes and controls intended to ensure that the accounting and disclosure for goodwill is appropriate our governance framework provides for oversight of assumptions forecast inputs methods process controls and results fair value fair value also referred to as an exit price is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date the fair value accounting guidance provides a threelevel fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments this hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable the fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level valuation is based on quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level valuation is based on observable marketbased inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market valuation techniques include pricing models dcf methodologies or similar techniques the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters when quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value changes in market conditions such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value we have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions if markets are determined to be inactive it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received when significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as level or level in making this determination we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument including observable market data indications of market liquidity and orderliness and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category judgments are made regarding the significance of the level inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety if level inputs are considered significant the instrument is classified as level the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions we discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs in item financial statements and supplementary datanote 16fair value measurement we have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types price verification and review of valuation judgments methods models process controls and results table start capital one financial corporation cof table end groups independent of our trading and investing functions participate in the review and validation process tasks performed by these groups include periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable including comparing prices from vendor pricing services to other available market information our fair value committee fvc which includes representation from business areas risk management and finance provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment the fvc regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance we have model policies established by an independent model risk office which govern the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements the model risk office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance the fair value governance process is set up in a manner that allows the chairperson of the fvc to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the fvc to a more senior committee called the valuations advisory committee vac for resolution the vac is chaired by the chief financial officer and includes other members of senior manageme nt there were no disputes escalated to the vac for the years ended december and customer rewards reserve we offer products primarily credit cards which include programs that allow members to earn rewards based on account activity that can be redeemed for cash primarily in the form of statement credits gift cards travel or covering eligible charges the amount of rewards that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product the majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the amount of rewards an eligible card member can earn customer rewards costs which we generally record as an offset to interchange income are driven by various factors such as card member purchase volume the terms and conditions of the rewards program and rewards redemption cost we establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects managements judgment regarding rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost we use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned by current card members based on historical redemption trends current enrollee redemption behavior card product type year of program enrollment enrollment tenure and card spend levels our current assumption is that the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed we use the weightedaverage redemption cost during the previous twelve months adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs including changes related to the mix of rewards redeemed to estimate future redemption costs we continually evaluate our reserve and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns changes to the terms and conditions of the rewards program and other factors while the rewards liability is sensitive to changes in assumptions for redemption rates and costs and involves management judgment we believe portfolio characteristics and historical performance are the best indication of future reward redemption behavior and are the primary basis for our estimate we recognized customer rewards expense of billion billion and billion in and respectively our customer rewards reserve which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets totaled billion and billion as of december and respectively we have a governance framework supported

the appropriateness of potential capital actions considering the companys capital objectives we quantify capital needs through stress testing regulatory capital economic capital and assessments of market considerations in assessing its capital adequacy we identify how and where our material risks are accounted for within the capital planning process monitoring and escalation processes exist for key capital thresholds and metrics to continuously monitor capital adequacy we manage liquidity risk by applying our liquidity adequacy framework the liquidity framework the liquidity framework uses

associates with specific risk management skills and expertise within the first second and third lines of defense are critical to execute appropriate risk management across the enterprise risk categories we apply our framework to protect the company from the major categories of risk that we are exposed to through our business activities we have seven major categories of risk as noted below table start major categories of risk compliance the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws rules or regulations compliance risk can also arise from nonconformance with prescribed practices internal policies and procedures contractual obligations or ethical standards that reinforce those laws rules or regulations credit the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from an obligors failure to meet the terms of any contract with the company or otherwise perform as agreed liquidity the risk that the company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time market the risk that an institutions earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates or other market factors operational the risk of loss capital impairment adverse customer experience or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures failed internal processes or systems or from external events reputation the risk to market value recruitment and retention of talented associates and maintenance of a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of our internal and external constituents regarding our business strategies and activities strategic the risk of a material impact on current or anticipated earnings capital franchise or enterprise value arising from the companys competitive and market position and evolving forces in the industry that can affect that position lack of responsiveness to these conditions strategic decisions to change the companys scale market position or operating model or failure to appropriately consider implementation risks inherent in the companys strategy table end we provide an overview of how we manage our seven major categories of risk below compliance risk management we recognize that compliance requirements for financial institutions are increasingly complex and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers in response we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment and proactively adjust our compliance program to fully address these expectations our compliance management program establishes expectations for determining compliance requirements assessing the risk of new product offerings creating appropriate controls and training to address requirements monitoring for control performance and independently testing for adherence to compliance requirements the program also establishes regular compliance reporting to senior business leaders the executive committee and the

and our compliance team periodically independently tests to validate the effectiveness of business controls credit risk management we recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality consequently we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting in unsecured consumer loan underwriting we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting in commercial underwriting we generally require strong cash flow collateral covenants and guarantees in addition to sound underwriting we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans the chief credit and financial risk officer in conjunction with the chief credit officers is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority

monitoring remediation and portfolio management the standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes these standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process starting with customer selection our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns we use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business we monitor performance relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to appropriate senior management committees and our board of directors liquidity risk management we recognize that liquidity risk is embedded within

trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk trends in delinquency rates are the key credit quality indicator for our credit card and retail banking loan portfolios as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in potential future credit losses the key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they provide insight into borrower risk profiles which give indications of potential future credit losses the key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings as we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming in addition to these credit quality indicators we also manage and monitor other credit quality metrics such as level of nonperforming loans and net chargeoff rates we underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models which typically include credit bureau data such as borrower credit scores application information and where applicable collateral and deal structure data we continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes we also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification for competitive benchmarking and in some

management activities including the management of investment securities shortterm and longterm borrowings and derivatives foreign operations in the uk and canada within our credit card business and customer accommodation activities within our commercial banking business we have enterprisewide risk management policies and limits approved by our board of directors which govern our market risk management activities our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and longterm expectations we provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities we manage our interest rate risk primarily by entering into interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments which could include caps floors options futures and forward contracts table start capital one financial corporation cof table end we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our nondollardenominated funding and nondollar equity investments in foreign operations net interest income sensitivity our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact of hypothetical instantaneous movements in interest rates relative to our baseline interest rate forecast on our projected 12month net interest income net interest income sensitivity metrics are derived using the following key assumptions in addition to our existing assets liabilities and derivative positions we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions these assumptions include loan and deposit growth pricing plans for projected changes in our funding mix and our securities and cash position from our internal corporate outlook that is used in our financial planning process the analysis assumes this forecast of expected future business growth remains unchanged between the baseline rate forecast and rate shock scenarios including no changes to our interest rate risk management activities like securities and hedging actions we incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta and mix as interest rates change and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates in our models deposit betas and mortgage security prepayments vary dynamically based on the level of interest rates and by product type in instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than we assume a rate of for that scenario this assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have a practice of employing negative policy rates in jurisdictions that have negative policy rates we do not floor interest rates at at the current level of interest rates our net interest income is expected to increase in higher rate scenarios and decrease in lower rate scenarios our current sensitivity to both upward and downward shocks is largely unchanged as compared to december as our asset mix shift toward credit card and interestbearing cash balances which reprice rapidly was offset by an increase in deposit beta which was driven by higher interest rates and mix shift toward higher rate deposit products in the contexts used in this section beta refers to the change in deposit rate paid relative to the federal funds rate as part of our ongoing evaluation of our interest rate risk modeling capabilities we enhanced our mortgage prepayment model in the fourth quarter of to improve how we estimate the expected prepayment behavior across various interest rate scenarios this enhancement had the effect of slowing down the forecasted prepayment speed when the underlying mortgage coupons on our existing mortgage securities are well below prevailing market mortgage rates which resulted in slightly lower net interest income sensitivity as of december table start capital one financial corporation cof table end economic value of equity sensitivity our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact of hypothetical instantaneous movements in interest rates on the net present value of our assets and liabilities including derivative exposures economic value of equity sensitivity metrics are derived using the following key assumptions the analysis includes only existing assets liabilities and derivative positions and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes similar to our net interest income sensitivity measure we incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing and attrition which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta as interest rates change and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates in our models deposit betas and mortgage security prepayments vary dynamically based on the level of interest rates and by product type balance attrition assumptions for loans including credit card auto and commercial loans remain unchanged between the baseline interest rate forecast and interest rate shock scenarios as those loans are mainly floating rate or shorter duration fixed rate loans and hence paydowns have a low sensitivity to the level of interest rates for assets and liabilities with embedded optionality such as mortgage securities and deposit balances we utilize monte carlo simulations to assess economic value with industrystandard term structure modeling of interest rates our calculations of net present value apply appropriate spreads over the benchmark yield curve for select assets and liabilities to capture the inherent risks including credit risk to discount expected interest and principal cash flows in instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than we assume a rate of for that scenario this assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have a practice of employing negative policy rates in jurisdictions that have negative policy rates we do not floor interest rates at our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity decreases in higher interest rate scenarios and increases in lower interest rate scenarios the decrease in higher rate scenarios is due to the declines in the projected value of our fixed rate assets being only partially offset by corresponding movements in the projected value of our deposits and other liabilities the pace of economic value of equity decrease is larger for the bps scenario as our deposits are assumed to reprice more rapidly in higher interest rate environments our current economic value of equity sensitivity became more negative in higher interest rate scenarios and more positive in lower interest rate scenarios as compared to december primarily due to an increase in deposit beta driven by higher interest rates and mix shift towards higher rate deposit products and a modeling change for our mortgage security prepayments forecast as described above for net interest income sensitivity the mortgage prepayment modeling change slowed down the prepayment speed forecast and increased the duration of the mortgage securities on our balance sheet which resulted in a modestly more negative economic value of equity sensitivity in higher rate scenarios as of december table start capital one financial corporation cof table end table shows the estimated percentage impact on

interest rate scenarios such as larger rate shocks higher than bps as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions we also regularly review the sensitivity of our interest rate risk metrics to changes in our key modeling assumptions such as our loan and deposit balance forecasts mortgage prepayments and deposit repricing limitations of market risk measures the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information internallydeveloped assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments other market inputs such as interest rates market prices and interest rate volatility are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures we regularly evaluate update and enhance these assumptions models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates the sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on our existing balance sheet and in some cases expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis for further information on our interest rate

exposed to foreign exchange risk due to changes in the dollardenominated value of future earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations and from our euro eurdenominated borrowings our nondollar denominated intercompany funding and eurdenominated borrowings expose our earnings to foreign exchange transaction risk we manage these transaction risks by using forward foreign currency derivatives and crosscurrency swaps to hedge our exposures we measure our foreign exchange transaction risk exposures by applying a us dollar appreciation shock against the value of the nondollar denominated
