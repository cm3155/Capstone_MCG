operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance such as certain restructuring charges the results of our individual businesses which we report on a continuing operations basis reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources we may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a standalone business we use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies including funds transfer pricing to assign certain balance sheet assets deposits and other liabilities and their related revenues and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment total interest income and noninterest income are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported the net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process which is primarily based on a matched funding concept that takes into consideration market interest rates our funds transfer pricing process is managed by our centralized corporate treasury group and provides a funds credit for sources of funds such as deposits generated by our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses and a charge for the use of funds by each segment the allocation is unique to each business segment and acquired business and is based on the composition of assets and liabilities the funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and offbalance sheet products periodically the methodology and assumptions utilized in the funds transfer pricing process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the business segments we regularly assess the assumptions methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods we provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in part iiitem financial statements and

risk and commodity pricing risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from the following operations and activities traditional banking activities of deposit gathering and lending assetliability management activities including the management of investment securities shortterm and longterm borrowings and derivatives foreign operations in the uk and canada within our credit card business and customer accommodation activities within our commercial banking business we have enterprisewide risk management policies and limits approved by our board of directors which govern our market risk management activities our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and longterm expectations we provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities we manage our interest rate risk primarily by entering into interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments which could include caps floors options futures and forward contracts we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our nondollardenominated funding and nondollar equity investments in foreign operations net interest income sensitivity our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact of hypothetical instantaneous movements in interest rates relative to our baseline interest rate forecast on our projected 12month net interest income net interest income sensitivity metrics are derived using the following key assumptions in addition to our existing assets liabilities and derivative positions we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions these assumptions include loan and deposit growth pricing plans for projected changes in our funding mix and our securities and cash position from our internal corporate outlook that is used in our financial planning process the analysis assumes this forecast of expected future business growth remains unchanged between the baseline rate forecast and rate shock scenarios including no changes to our interest rate risk management activities like securities and hedging actions we incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta and mix as interest rates change and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates in our models deposit betas and mortgage security prepayments vary dynamically based on the level of interest rates and by product type in the contexts used in this section beta refers to the change in deposit rate paid relative to the change in the federal funds rate in instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than we assume a rate of for that scenario this assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have a practice of employing negative policy rates in jurisdictions that have negative policy rates we do not floor interest rates at at the current level of interest rates our projected 12month net interest income is expected to increase in higher rate scenarios and decrease in lower rate scenarios the decrease in lower rate scenarios is driven by lower interest income from our assets including floating rate credit card and commercial loans being partially offset by lower interest expense from our deposits and capital one financial corporation cof other liabilities net of our interest rate hedges our current sensitivity to both upward and downward shocks is largely unchanged as compared to december economic value of equity sensitivity our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact of hypothetical instantaneous movements in interest rates on the net present value of our assets and liabilities including derivative exposures economic value of equity sensitivity metrics are derived using the following key assumptions the analysis includes only existing assets liabilities and derivative positions and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes similar to our net interest income sensitivity measure we incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing and attrition which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta as interest rates change and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates in our models deposit betas and mortgage security prepayments vary dynamically based on the level of interest rates and by product type balance attrition assumptions for loans including credit card auto and commercial loans remain unchanged between the baseline interest rate forecast and interest rate shock scenarios as those loans are mainly floating rate or shorter duration fixed rate loans and hence paydowns have a low sensitivity to the level of interest rates for assets and liabilities with embedded optionality such as mortgage securities and deposit balances we utilize monte carlo simulations to assess economic value with industrystandard term structure modeling of interest rates our calculations of net present value apply appropriate spreads over the benchmark yield curve for select assets and liabilities to capture the inherent risks including credit risk to discount expected interest and principal cash flows in instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than we assume a rate of for that scenario this assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have a practice of employing negative policy rates in jurisdictions that have negative policy rates we do not floor interest rates at our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity decreases in higher interest rate scenarios and increases in lower interest rate scenarios the decrease in higher rate scenarios is due to the declines in the projected value of our fixed rate assets being only partially offset by corresponding movements in the projected value of our deposits and other liabilities the pace of economic value of equity decrease is larger for the bps scenario as our deposits are assumed to reprice more rapidly in higher interest rate environments our current economic value of equity sensitivity is largely unchanged as compared to december capital one financial corporation cof table shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected

estimated impact on projected baseline net interest income basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points estimated impact on economic value of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points in addition to these industry standard measures we also consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios such as larger rate shocks higher than bps as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions we also regularly review the sensitivity of our interest rate risk metrics to changes in our key modeling assumptions such as our loan and deposit balance forecasts mortgage prepayments and deposit repricing limitations of market risk measures the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information internallydeveloped assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments other market inputs such as interest rates market prices and interest rate volatility are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures we regularly evaluate update and enhance these assumptions models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates the sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on our existing balance sheet and in some cases expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis for further information on our interest rate exposures see part iitem financial statements and
