institution in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary depository institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment bppr and pb are currently the only insured depository institution subsidiaries of popular and pna resolution planning and resolutionrelated requirements a bank holding company with billion or more in total consolidated assets or that is a category iii firm based on certain riskbased indicators described in the tailoring rules is required to report periodically to the fdic and the federal reserve board such companys plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure in addition insured depository institutions with total assets of billion or more are required to submit to the fdic periodic contingency plans for resolution in the event of the institutions failure in the fdic issued a moratorium on resolution plans for insured depository institutions with more than billion in assets the moratorium is still in effect for insured depository institutions with more than billion but less than billion in assets on august the fdic proposed amendments to the resolution planning requirements for insured depository institutions with billion or more in total assets the amendments would require insured depository institutions with between billion and billion in assets to submit informational filings on a twoyear cycle with an interim supplement updating key information submitted in the off years on august the federal reserve board fdic and office of the comptroller of the currency occ issued a proposed rule that would require bank holding companies and insured depository institutions with billion or more in consolidated assets as well as their insured depository institution affiliates to maintain minimum amounts of eligible longterm debt generally debt that is unsecured has a maturity greater than one year from issuance and satisfies additional criteria subject to a threeyear phasein period the proposal would also apply clean holding company requirements to category ii through iv bank holding companies which would among other things prohibit entering into derivatives and certain other financial contracts with third parties as of december popular pna bppr and pbs total assets were below the thresholds for applicability of these rules except that bppr would be subject to the fdics proposed amendments to its resolution planning requirements applicable to insured depository institutions with more than billion but less than billion in assets if those amendments are adopted as proposed fdic insurance substantially all the deposits of bppr and pb are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund dif of the fdic and bppr and pb are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif deposit insurance assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution minus the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period for larger depository institutions with over billion in assets such as bppr and pb the fdic uses a scorecard methodology which considers camels ratings among other measures that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual large institution will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the dif if such a failure occurs the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate for larger depository institutions ranges from to basis points on an annualized basis after the effect of potential baserate adjustments the total base assessment rate could range from to basis points on an annualized basis in october the fdic finalized a rule that increased initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of the fdic as required under the federal deposit insurance act fdia established a plan in september to restore the dif reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of percent within eight years the increased assessment is intended to improve the likelihood that the dif reserve ratio would reach the required minimum by the statutory deadline of september as of december we had a dif average total asset less average tangible equity assessment base of approximately billion on november the fdic finalized a rule that imposes a special assessment to recover the costs to the dif resulting from the fdics use in march of the systemic risk exception to the leastcost resolution test under the fdia in connection with the receiverships of silicon valley bank and signature bank the fdic estimated in approving the rule that those assessed losses total approximately billion the rule provides that this loss estimate will be periodically adjusted which will affect the amount of the special assessment under the rule the assessment base is the estimated uninsured deposits that an insured depository institution reported in its consolidated reports of condition and income call report at december excluding the first billion in estimated uninsured deposits for a holding company that has more than one insured depository institution subsidiary such as popular the billion exclusion is allocated among the companys insured depository institution subsidiaries in proportion to each insured depository institutions estimated uninsured deposits the special assessments will be collected at an annual rate of approximately basis points per year basis points per quarter over eight quarters in and with the first assessment period beginning january because the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted the fdic retains the ability to cease collection early extend the special assessment collection period and impose a final shortfall special assessment on a onetime basis popular expects the special assessments to be tax deductible the total of the assessments for popular is estimated at million and such amount was recorded as an expense in the quarter of adoption the quarter ended december as of december the fdics loss estimate described in the final rule had increased by approximately billion to billion or approximately if such increase in the fdics loss estimate remains unchanged and is assessed in the same manner the corporation estimates that the incremental expense for the special assessments could be approximately million brokered deposits the fdia and regulations adopted thereunder restrict the use of brokered deposits and the rate of interest payable on deposits for institutions that are less than well capitalized popular does not believe the brokered deposits regulations have had or will have a material effect on the funding or liquidity of bppr and pb capital adequacy popular pna bppr and pb are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies the capital rules which implement the basel iii framework set forth by the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act among other matters the capital rules i impose a capital measure called common equity tier cet1 and the related regulatory capital ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets ii specify that tier capital consists of cet1 and additional tier capital instruments meeting certain revised requirements and iii mandate that most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 and not to the other components of capital under the capital rules for most banking organizations including popular the most common form of additional tier capital is noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of tier capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses in each case subject to the capital rules specific requirements pursuant to the capital rules the minimum capital ratios are cet1 to riskweighted assets tier capital that is cet1 plus additional tier capital to riskweighted assets total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets and tier capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements known as the leverage ratio the capital rules also impose a capital conservation buffer composed entirely of cet1 on top of these minimum risk weighted asset ratios the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and eligible retained income that is four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income thus popular bppr and pb are required to maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of of cet1 effectively resulting in minimum ratios of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least ii tier capital to riskweighted assets of at least and iii total capital to risk weighted assets of at least in addition under prior riskbased capital rules the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss aoci items included in stockholders equity for example markstomarket of securities held in the available for sale portfolio under us gaap were reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios pursuant to the capital rules the effects of certain aoci items are not excluded however banking organizations that are not subject to categories i or ii standards under the framework for banking organizations with billion or more in assets including popular bppr and pb may make a onetime permanent election to continue to exclude these items popular bppr and pb have made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their available for sale securities portfolios the capital rules preclude certain hybrid securities such as trust preferred securities from inclusion in bank holding companies tier capital trust preferred securities no longer included in populars tier capital may nonetheless be included as a component of tier capital popular has not issued any trust preferred securities since may as of december popular has million of trust preferred securities outstanding which no longer qualify for tier capital treatment but instead qualify for tier capital treatment the capital rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 banking organizations that are not subject to category i or ii standards are subject to rules that provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for certain mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital failure to meet capital guidelines could subject popular and its depository institution subsidiaries to a variety of enforcement remedies including the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and to certain restrictions on our business refer to prompt corrective action below for further discussion in december the basel committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the basel iii post crisis regulatory reforms among other things these standards revise the basel committees standardized approach for credit risk including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card lines of credit and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital under the current us capital rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions and not to popular bppr and pb on july the federal banking regulators proposed revisions to the capital rules to implement the basel committees standards and make other changes to the capital rules including the ability of banking organizations in categories iii and iv to elect not to recognize most elements of aoci in regulatory capital the proposal introduces revised credit risk equity risk operational risk credit valuation adjustment risk and market risk requirements among other changes however the revised capital requirements of the proposed rule would not apply to popular bppr or pb because they have less than billion in total consolidated assets and trading assets and liabilities below the threshold for market risk requirements in december the federal banking agencies approved a final rule modifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an option to phase in over a period of three years the dayone regulatory capital effects of the current expected credit loss cecl model of asu the final rule also revised the agencies other rules to reflect the update to the accounting standards popular has availed itself of the option to phase in over a period of three years the day one effects on regulatory capital from the adoption of cecl in federal bank regulators adopted a rule that allowed banking organizations to elect to delay temporarily the estimated effects of adopting cecl on regulatory capital until january and subsequently to phase in the effects through january refer to the consolidated financial statements in this s the sec also announced plans to propose rules to require enhanced disclosure regarding human capital management and board diversity for public issuers incentive compensation the federal reserve board reviews as part of its regular riskfocused examination process the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations such as popular that are not large complex banking organizations deficiencies will be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect the organizations ability to make acquisitions and take other actions enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies the federal reserve board occ and fdic have issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to discourage excessive risktaking in the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations in order to not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations the guidance which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risktaking beyond the organizations ability to effectively identify and manage risks ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and iii be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors the doddfrank act requires the us financial regulators including the federal reserve board the other federal banking agencies and the sec to adopt rules prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss at specified regulated entities having at least billion in total assets including popular pna bppr and pb the us financial regulators proposed revised rules in which have not been finalized in october the sec adopted a final rule requiring securities exchanges to adopt rules mandating in the case of a restatement the recovery or clawback of excess incentivebased compensation paid to current or former executive officers and requiring listed issuers to disclose any recovery analysis where recovery is triggered by a restatement the excess compensation would be based on the amount the executive officer would have received had the incentivebased compensation been determined using the restated financials the nasdaq stock markets listing standards pursuant to the secs rule became effective october populars clawback policy adopted in accordance with these listing standards is included as
