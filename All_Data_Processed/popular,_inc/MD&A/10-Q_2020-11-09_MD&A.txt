in the federal funds rate partially offset by an increase in average volume lower interest income from investment securities due to lower rates partially offset by a higher volume of us treasuries and us agency mortgage backed agency securities to deploy liquidity and to benefit from the puerto rico tax exemption of these assets and lower interest income from loans driven by the lower amortization of fair value discount of the auto loan portfolio acquired from wells fargos auto finance subsidiary in puerto rico during reliable waived fees on past due loans associated to the moratorium to

interest rate risk the financial results and capital levels of the corporation are constantly exposed to market interest rate and liquidity risks market risk refers to the risk of a reduction in the

managing interest rate risk management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities change pricing schedules adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities and enter into derivative contracts among other alternatives interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position given line of business forecasts management objectives market expectations and policy constraints management utilizes various tools to assess irr including net interest income nii simulation modeling static gap analysis and economic value of equity eve the three methodologies complement each other and are used jointly in the evaluation of the corporations irr nii simulation modeling is prepared for a fiveyear period which in conjunction with the eve analysis provides management a better view of longterm irr net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various nii simulations under different interest rate scenarios that differ in direction of interest rate changes the degree of change and the projected shape of the yield curve for example the types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat rates implied forwards and parallel and nonparallel rate shocks management also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures the asset and liability management group perform validation procedures on various assumptions used as part of the simulation analyses as well as validations of results on a monthly basis in addition the model and processes used to assess irr are subject to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the model governance and validation policy the corporation processes nii simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline by the same amount parallel shifts the rate scenarios considered in these market risk simulations reflect instantaneous parallel changes of and basis points during the succeeding twelvemonth period simulation analyses are based on many assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points and indexes interest rate spreads loan prepayments and deposit elasticity thus they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results further the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in interest rates by their nature these forwardlooking computations are only estimates and may be different from what may actually occur in the future the following table presents the results of the simulations at september and december assuming a static balance sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over a oneyear time horizon table net interest income sensitivity one year projection september december  in thousands amount change percent change amount change percent change change in interest rate basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points as of september nii simulations show the corporation maintains an asset sensitive position and is expected to benefit from an overall rising rate environment the changes in sensitivity for the period are primarily driven by large deposit increases of over billion along with reductions in the rates paid for deposit products overall rates are now considered to be close to their lower bound because we currently assume in our interest risk models that rates will not reach negative values this has the effect of reducing sensitivity in most products given that rates are close to zero in most curve tenors and therefore have little room to fall further in the declining rates scenarios we would expect this flooring effect on sensitivity to declining rates to reverse itself if rates were to rise because it would mean that rates would once again have more room to fall in contrast the sensitivity to rising rate scenarios notably increased as most of the increase in deposits remained in shortterm assets and cash at the close of the quarter the corporations loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk which results from the ability of a thirdparty to repay debt obligations prior to maturity prepayment risk also could have a significant impact on the duration of mortgagebacked securities and collateralized mortgage obligations since prepayments could shorten or lower prepayments could extend the weighted average life of these portfolios trading the corporation engages in trading activities in the ordinary course

growth fund planned capital distributions and maintain a reasonable safety margin for cash commitments under both normal and stressed market conditions the board of directors is responsible for establishing the corporations tolerance for liquidity risk including approving relevant risk limits and policies the board of directors has delegated the monitoring of these risks to the boards risk management committee and the assetliability management committee the management of liquidity risk on a longterm and daytoday basis is the responsibility of the corporate treasury division the corporations corporate treasurer is responsible for implementing the policies and procedures approved by the board of directors and for monitoring the corporations liquidity position on an ongoing basis also the corporate treasury division coordinates corporate wide liquidity management strategies and activities with the reportable segments oversees policy breaches and manages the escalation process the financial and operational risk management division is responsible for the independent monitoring and reporting of adherence with established policies an institutions liquidity may be pressured if for example it experiences a sudden and unexpected substantial cash outflow due to exogenous events such as the current covid19 pandemic its credit rating is downgraded or some other event causes counterparties to avoid exposure to the institution factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook adverse ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding liquidity is managed by the corporation at the level of the holding companies that own the banking and nonbanking subsidiaries it is also managed at the level of the banking and nonbanking subsidiaries as further explained below a principal source of liquidity for the bank holding companies the bhcs are dividends received from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries the corporation has adopted policies and limits to monitor more effectively the corporations liquidity position and that of the banking subsidiaries additionally contingency funding plans are used to model various stress events of different magnitudes and affecting different time horizons that assist management in evaluating the size of the liquidity buffers needed if those stress events occur however such models may not predict accurately how the market and customers might react to every event and are dependent on many assumptions deposits including customer deposits brokered deposits and public funds deposits continue to be the most significant source of funds for the corporation funding of the corporations total assets at september and at december the ratio of total ending loans to deposits was at september compared to at december in addition to traditional deposits the corporation maintains borrowing arrangements which amounted to approximately billion at september december billion a detailed description of the corporations borrowings including their terms is included in note to the consolidated financial statements also the consolidated statements of cash flows in the accompanying consolidated financial statements provide information on the corporations cash inflows and outflows as previously mentioned during the

subsidiaries and eliminations column banking subsidiaries primary sources of funding for the corporations banking subsidiaries bppr and pb or collectively the banking subsidiaries include retail commercial and public sector deposits brokered deposits unpledged investment securities mortgage loan securitization and to a lesser extent loan sales in addition the corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the fhlb and at the discount window of the federal reserve bank of new york the frb and has a considerable amount of collateral pledged that can be used to raise funds under these facilities refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information of the corporations borrowing facilities available through its banking subsidiaries the principal uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include loan originations investment portfolio purchases loan purchases and repurchases repayment of outstanding obligations including deposits advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational expenses also the banking subsidiaries assume liquidity risk related to collateral posting requirements for certain activities mainly in connection with contractual commitments recourse provisions servicing advances derivatives credit card licensing agreements and support to several mutual funds administered by bppr the banking subsidiaries maintain sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows the corporation has established liquidity guidelines that require the banking subsidiaries to have sufficient liquidity to cover all shortterm borrowings and a portion of deposits the corporations ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits excluding brokered deposits depends on various factors including pricing service convenience and financial stability as reflected by operating results credit ratings by nationally recognized credit rating agencies and importantly fdic deposit insurance although a downgrade in the credit ratings of the corporations banking subsidiaries may impact their ability to raise retail and commercial deposits or the rate that it is required to pay on such deposits management does not believe that the impact should be material deposits at all of the corporations banking subsidiaries are federally insured subject to fdic limits and this is expected to mitigate the potential effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings deposits are a key source of funding as they tend to be less volatile than institutional borrowings and their cost is less sensitive to changes in market rates refer to table for a breakdown of deposits by major types core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and public sector customers core deposits include all noninterest bearing deposits savings deposits and certificates of deposit under excluding brokered deposits with denominations under core deposits have historically provided the corporation with a sizable source of relatively stable and lowcost funds core deposits totaled billion or of total deposits at september compared with billion or of total deposits at december core deposits financed of the corporations earning assets at september compared with at december the distribution by maturity of certificates of deposits with denominations of and over at september is presented in the table that follows table distribution by maturity of certificate of deposits of and over in thousands months or less to months to months over months total the corporation had billion in brokered deposits at september which financed approximately of its total assets december billion and respectively in the event that any of the corporations banking subsidiaries regulatory capital ratios fall below those required by a wellcapitalized institution or are subject to capital restrictions by the regulators that banking subsidiary faces the risk of not being able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and faces limitations on the rate paid on deposits which may hinder the corporations ability to effectively compete in its retail markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts deposits from the public sector represent an important source of funds for the company as of september total public sector deposits were billion generally these deposits require that the bank pledge high credit quality securities as collateral therefore liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower given that the bank receives its collateral in return however there are some timing differences between the time the deposit outflow occurs and when the bank receives its collateral this now unpledged collateral can either be financed via repurchase agreements or sold for cash at september management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources to meet their anticipated cash flow obligations as well as special needs and offbalance sheet commitments in the ordinary course of business and have sufficient liquidity resources to address a stress event although the banking subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances no assurance can be given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if the corporations financial condition or general market conditions were to deteriorate the corporations financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates the banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements to the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of market changes the corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements thereby adversely affecting its liquidity finally if management is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to meet its future growth revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs in this case profitability would be adversely affected bank holding companies the principal sources of funding for the bhcs which are popular inc holding company only and pna include cash on hand investment securities dividends received from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries asset sales credit facilities available from affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings dividends from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory limits and authorization requirements that are further described below and that may limit the ability of those subsidiaries to act as a source of funding to the bhcs the principal use of these funds includes the repayment of debt and interest payments to holders of senior debt and junior subordinated deferrable interest related to trust preferred securities the payment of dividends to common stockholders and capitalizing its banking subsidiaries the bhcs have in the past borrowed in the money markets and in the corporate debt market primarily to finance their nonbanking subsidiaries however the cash needs of the corporations nonbanking subsidiaries other than to repay indebtedness and interest are now minimal these sources of funding have become more costly due to the corporations principal credit rating being below investment grade which affects the corporations ability to raise funds in the capital markets the corporation has an automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the securities and exchange commission which permits the corporation to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities the outstanding balance of notes payable at the bhcs amounted to million at september and million at december the contractual maturities of the bhcs notes payable at september are presented in table table distribution of bhcs notes payable by contractual maturity year in thousands later years total annual debt service at the bhcs is approximately million per annum and the companys latest quarterly dividend was per share the bhcs liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash on hand investments and other sources of liquidity which are expected to be enough to meet all bhcs obligations during the foreseeable future as of september the bhcs had cash and money markets investments totaling million borrowing potential of million from its secured facility with bppr in addition to these liquidity sources the stake in evertec had a market value of million as of september and it represents an additional source of contingent liquidity nonbanking subsidiaries the principal sources of funding for the nonbanking subsidiaries include internally generated cash flows from operations loan sales repurchase agreements capital injections and borrowed funds from their direct parent companies or the holding companies the principal uses of funds for the nonbanking subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt operational expenses and payment of dividends to the bhcs the liquidity needs of the nonbanking subsidiaries are minimal since most of them are funded internally from operating cash flows or from intercompany borrowings or capital contributions from their holding companies dividends during the nine months ended september the corporation declared quarterly dividends on its outstanding common stock of per share for a yeartodate total of million the dividends for the corporations series a and series b preferred stock amounted to million on february the corporation redeemed all the outstanding shares of series b preferred stock refer to note for additional information during the nine months ended september the bhcs received dividends amounting to million from bppr million from pibi which main source of income is derived from its investment in bhd million in dividends from its nonbanking subsidiaries and million in dividends from evertec dividends from bppr constitute popular incs primary source of liquidity other funding sources and capital the debt securities portfolio provides an additional source of liquidity which may be realized through either securities sales or repurchase agreements the corporations debt securities portfolio consists primarily of liquid us government debt securities us government sponsored agency debt securities us government sponsored agency mortgagebacked securities and us government sponsored agency collateralized mortgage obligations that can be used to raise funds in the repo markets the availability of the repurchase agreement would be subject to having sufficient unpledged collateral available at the time the transactions are to be consummated in addition to overall liquidity and risk appetite of the various counterparties the corporations unpledged debt securities amounted to billion at september and billion at december a substantial portion of these debt securities could be used to raise financing in the us money markets or from secured lending sources additional liquidity may be provided through loan maturities prepayments and sales the loan portfolio can also be used to obtain funding in the capital markets in particular mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans have secondary markets which the corporation could use risks to liquidity total lines of credit outstanding are not necessarily a measure of the total credit available on a continuing basis some of these lines could be subject to collateral requirements standards of creditworthiness leverage ratios and other regulatory requirements among other factors derivatives such as those embedded in longterm repurchase transactions or interest rate swaps and offbalance sheet exposures such as recourse performance bonds or credit card arrangements are subject to collateral requirements as their fair value increases the collateral requirements may increase thereby reducing the balance of unpledged securities the importance of the puerto rico market for the corporation is an additional risk factor that could affect its financing activities in the case of a deterioration in economic and fiscal conditions in puerto rico the credit quality of the corporation could be affected and result in higher credit costs refer to the geographic and government risk section of this mda for some highlights on the current status of the puerto rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding in order to prepare for the possibility of such scenario management has adopted contingency plans for raising financing under stress scenarios when important sources of funds that are usually fully available are temporarily unavailable these plans call for using alternate funding mechanisms such as the pledging of certain asset classes and accessing secured credit lines and loan facilities put in place with the fhlb and the frb the credit ratings of populars debt obligations are a relevant factor for liquidity because they impact the corporations ability to borrow in the capital markets its cost and access to funding sources credit ratings are based on the financial strength credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio the level and volatility of earnings capital adequacy the quality of management geographic concentration in puerto rico the liquidity of the balance sheet the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits and the corporations ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources among other factors furthermore various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval a member bank must obtain the approval of the federal reserve board for any dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock in addition a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its report of condition and income unless the member bank has received the approval of the federal reserve board a member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the federal reserve board pursuant to these requirements pb may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the nysdfs the ability of a bank subsidiary to upstream dividends to its bhc could thus be impacted by its financial performance thus potentially limiting the amount of cash moving up to the bhcs from the banking subsidiaries this could in turn affect the bhcs ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock for example popular inc received million in dividends from bppr during the nine months ended september and its ability to continue receiving dividends from bppr will depend on such banking subsidiarys financial condition and results of operation the corporations banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations and therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the corporations overall credit ratings obligations subject to rating triggers or collateral requirements the corporations banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings the banking subsidiaries had million in deposits at september that are subject to rating triggers in addition certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that bppr has with third parties include rating covenants in the event of a credit rating downgrade the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits andor increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations also as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements the corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions certain contractual agreements require the corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institutions required credit ratings are not maintained collateral pledged by the corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately million at september the corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed the requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the corporations liquidity resources and impact its operating results credit risk geographic and government risk the corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk the corporations assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements commonwealth of puerto rico a significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the commonwealth of puerto rico the commonwealth or puerto rico which faces severe economic and fiscal challenges covid19 pandemic on december a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 surfaced in wuhan china and has since spread globally to other countries and jurisdictions including the mainland united states and puerto rico in march the world health organization declared the covid19 to be a pandemic the pandemic has significantly disrupted and negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains created significant volatility in financial markets and increased unemployment levels worldwide including in the markets in which we do business in puerto rico the governor issued an executive order on march declaring a health emergency ordering residents to shelter in place implementing a mandatory curfew and requiring the closure of all businesses except for businesses that provide essential services including banking and financial institutions with respect to certain services while many of the restrictions have been gradually lifted a mandatory curfew is still in effect and most businesses have had to make significant adjustments to protect customers and employees including transitioning to telework and suspending or modifying certain operations in compliance with health and safety guidelines the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to have an adverse effect on economic activity in puerto rico in the longterm will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic the restrictions imposed by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the same and the amount of federal and local assistance offered to offset the impact of the pandemic however the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken by governments in response to the same have had a material adverse effect on economic activity worldwide including in puerto rico and there can be no assurance that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to offset the pandemics economic impact in response to the pandemic on april the puerto rico legislative assembly enacted legislation requiring financial institutions to offer moratoriums on consumer financial products to clients impacted by the covid19 pandemic through june in the case of mortgage loans the moratorium period was extended through august these moratoriums could among other things limit our ability to determine the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the financial condition of certain of our customers and the credit quality of our loan portfolio until borrowers that have benefited from such moratoriums are required to resume loan repayments additionally the federal government has also approved several economic stimulus measures including the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act that seek to cushion the economic fallout of the pandemic including guaranteeing through the small business administrations paycheck protection program the ppp loans to small and medium businesses for a discussion of the impact of the pandemic on the corporations operations and financial results during the second quarter of refer to the mda significant events section on the accompanying financial statements for additional discussion of risk factors related to the impact of the pandemic see part ii item risk factors in this form 10q for information regarding the projections of the fiscal plan defined below with respect to the impact of the pandemic see fiscal plans commonwealth fiscal plan below economic performance the commonwealths economy entered a recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and its gross national product gnp contracted in real terms every fiscal year between and with the exception of fiscal year pursuant to the latest puerto rico planning board the planning board estimates dated june the commonwealths real gnp for fiscal years and decreased by and respectively the planning board estimates that real gnp increased approximately in fiscal year due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments to repair damage caused by hurricanes irma and maría the planning board also projects a contraction in real gnp of and in fiscal years and respectively due primarily to the adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken by the government in response to the same fiscal crisis the commonwealth remains in the midst of a profound fiscal crisis affecting the central government and many of its instrumentalities public corporations and municipalities this fiscal crisis has been primarily the result of economic contraction persistent and significant budget deficits a high debt burden unfunded legacy obligations and lack of access to the capital markets among other factors as a result of the crisis the commonwealth and certain of its instrumentalities have been unable to make debt service payments on their outstanding bonds and notes since the escalating fiscal and economic crisis and imminent widespread defaults prompted the us congress to enact the puerto rico oversight management and economic stability act promesa in june the commonwealth and several of its instrumentalities are currently in the process of restructuring their debts through the debt restructuring mechanisms provided by promesa recent seismic activity on january puerto rico was struck by a magnitude earthquake which caused islandwide power outages and significant damage to infrastructure and property in the southwest region of the island the earthquake was preceded by foreshocks and followed by aftershocks the commonwealths government estimates total earthquakerelated damages at approximately billion promesa promesa among other things created a sevenmember federallyappointed oversight board the oversight board with ample powers over the fiscal and economic affairs of the commonwealth its public corporations instrumentalities and municipalities and established two mechanisms for the restructuring of the obligations of such entities pursuant to promesa the oversight board will remain in place until market access is restored and balanced budgets in accordance with modified accrual accounting are produced for at least four consecutive years in august president obama appointed the seven voting members of the oversight board through the process established in promesa which authorizes the president to select the members from several lists required to be submitted by congressional leaders and which process was recently upheld by the us supreme court the terms of the original oversight board members expired on august but promesa allows members to remain in their roles until their successors have been appointed all of the original members continued to serve on the oversight board on holdover status until earlier this year when three of the original members resigned and one members holdover status terminated upon president donald trumps appointment of a new member the remaining three original members continue serving on holdover status but their holdover status would terminate upon the appointment of new members through the process established in promesa in october the oversight board designated the commonwealth and all of its public corporations and instrumentalities as covered entities under promesa the only commonwealth government entities that were not subject to such initial designation were the commonwealths municipalities in may however the oversight board designated all of the commonwealths municipalities as covered entities at the oversight boards request covered entities are required to submit fiscal plans and annual budgets to the oversight board for its review and approval they are also required to seek oversight board approval to issue guarantee or modify their debts and to enter into contracts with an aggregate value of million or more finally covered entities are potentially eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by promesa fiscal plans commonwealth fiscal plan the oversight board has certified several fiscal plans for the commonwealth since the most recent fiscal plan for the commonwealth certified by the oversight board is dated may the fiscal plan the fiscal plan estimates that the economy of puerto rico will contract by in real terms in fiscal year largely due to the covid19 pandemic with a limited recovery of in fiscal year this new economic outlook exacerbates the commonwealth governments fiscal challenges as a result of these changes the fiscal plan projects that the commonwealth will have a precontractual debt service deficit each year through if the measures and structural reforms contemplated by the plan are not successfully implemented it estimates that the proposed fiscal measures and structural reforms will drive approximately billion in savings and extra revenue through and a cumulative increase in growth by fiscal year however even after the fiscal measures and structural reforms and before contractual debt service the fiscal plans projections reflect an annual deficit starting in fiscal year the fiscal plan provides for the gradual reduction and the ultimate elimination of commonwealth budgetary subsidies to municipalities which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of certain municipalities since fiscal year commonwealth appropriations to municipalities have been reduced by approximately from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year in response to the covid19 crisis the fiscal plan provided for a oneyear pause on reductions to appropriations to municipalities accordingly appropriations to municipalities for fiscal year remained at million rather than declining by million as contemplated by the prior fiscal plan in addition the governor signed an executive order that adopts the strategic plan for disbursement of the billion allocated to puerto rico by the coronavirus relief fund created by the federal government through the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act such plan assigns million to municipalities for eligible expenses related to covid19 the fiscal plan contemplates additional reductions in appropriations to municipalities starting in fiscal year before eventually phasing out all appropriations in fiscal year the fiscal plan notes that municipalities have made little or no progress towards implementing fiscal discipline required to reduce reliance on commonwealth appropriations and better address the impact of declining populations and that as currently operating many municipalities are not fiscally sustainable other fiscal plans pursuant to promesa the oversight board has also requested and certified fiscal plans for several public corporations and instrumentalities the certified fiscal plan for the puerto rico electric power authority prepa puerto ricos electric power utility contemplated the transformation of puerto ricos electric system through among other things the establishment of a publicprivate partnership with respect to prepas transmission and distribution system and calls for significant structural reforms at prepa the procurement process for the establishment of a publicprivate partnership with respect to prepas transmission and distribution system the td system was completed in june the selected proponent luma energy llc luma and prepa entered into a 15year agreement whereby luma will be responsible for operating maintaining and modernizing the td system on june the oversight board certified a fiscal plan the crim fiscal plan for the municipal revenue collection center the government entity responsible for collecting property taxes and distributing them among the municipalities the crim fiscal plan outlines a series of measures centered around improving the competitiveness of puerto ricos property tax regime and the enhancement of property tax collections including identifying and appraising new properties as well as improvements to existing properties and implementing operational and technological initiatives pending title iii proceedings on may the oversight board on behalf of the commonwealth filed a petition in the us district court to restructure the commonwealths liabilities under title iii of promesa the oversight board has subsequently filed analogous petitions with respect to the puerto rico sales tax financing corporation cofina the employees retirement system of the government of the commonwealth of puerto rico ers the puerto rico highways and transportation authority prepa and the puerto rico public buildings authority pba on february the government completed a restructuring of cofinas debts pursuant to a plan of adjustment confirmed by the us district court on september the oversight board filed a plan of adjustment for the commonwealth ers and pba in the pending debt restructuring proceedings under title iii of promesa on february the oversight board announced that it had reached a new agreement with certain bondholders on a new framework for a plan of adjustment and on february the oversight board filed an amended plan of adjustment reflecting such new agreement in light of the covid19 pandemic however the oversight board requested that the court adjourn court proceedings related to the proposed plan of adjustment so as to allow for the government and the oversight board to prioritize the health and safety of the people of puerto rico and to gain a better understanding of the economic and fiscal impact of the pandemic promesa adversary proceeding in the oversight board commenced an adversary proceeding against the commonwealth seeking to invalidate act act which eliminated the obligation of municipalities to contribute to the commonwealths health plan and payasyougo retirement system on the grounds that act was inconsistent with the fiscal plan on april the judge ruled in favor of the oversight board and declared act unenforceable and of no effect judge swain delayed the effective date of the opinion and order for three weeks through may to provide time for the government and the oversight board to agree on a mechanism for the reimbursement to the commonwealth of approximately million and million respectively on account of retirement and health plan obligations due by municipalities as a result of the invalidation of act subsequent to the courts decision the oversight board the government and the municipal revenue collection center crim which is the entity primarily responsible for the collection of property taxes for the municipalities made various proposals to resolve the immediate fiscal impact of act 29s invalidation on may the government filed a motion informing the court that crim had agreed to accept a proposal by the oversight board to reverse a million transfer from the commonwealth to the municipalities in the commonwealths fiscal year budget to be allocated among municipalities to offset the approximately million obligation of municipalities for the health plan and payasyou go retirement system payments for fiscal year the remaining million would have to be repaid by municipalities by the end of fiscal year from other sources of revenue there continue to be differences between the government and the oversight board as to the calculation of the municipalities obligation for the health plan and retirement system payments as well as to longterm solutions to the fiscal consequences to the municipalities of act 29s invalidation the effect of the courts decision and the implementation of the offset proposal described above on municipal finances is likely to vary significantly across municipalities exposure of the corporation the credit quality of bpprs loan portfolio reflects among other things the general economic conditions in puerto rico and other adverse conditions affecting puerto rico consumers and businesses the effects of the prolonged recession have been reflected in limited loan demand an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in puerto rico while promesa provides a process to address the commonwealths fiscal crisis the length and complexity of the title iii proceedings for the commonwealth and various of its instrumentalities and the adjustment measures required by the fiscal plans present significant economic risks in addition the covid19 outbreak has affected many of our individual customers and customers businesses this when added to puerto ricos ongoing fiscal crisis and recession could cause credit losses that adversely affect us and may negatively affect consumer confidence result in reductions in consumer spending and adversely impact our interest and noninterest revenues if global or local economic conditions worsen or the government of puerto rico and the oversight board are unable to adequately manage the commonwealths fiscal and economic challenges including by controlling the adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic and consummating an orderly restructuring of the commonwealths debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services these adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict at september and december the corporations direct exposure to the puerto rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities totaled million and million respectively which amounts were fully outstanding on such dates on july the corporation received principal payments amounting to million from various obligations from puerto rico municipalities further deterioration of the commonwealths fiscal and economic situation could adversely affect the value of our puerto rico government obligations resulting in losses to us of the amount outstanding million consists of loans and million are securities million and million respectively at december substantially all of the amount outstanding at september were obligations from various puerto rico municipalities in most cases these were general obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith credit and unlimited taxing power or special obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues at september of the corporations exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of san juan guaynabo carolina and bayamón for additional discussion of the corporations direct exposure to the puerto rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities refer to note commitments and contingencies in addition at september the corporation had million in loans insured or securities issued by puerto rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is nongovernmental million at december these included million in residential mortgage loans insured by the puerto rico housing finance authority hfa a governmental instrumentality that has been designated as a covered entity under promesa december million these mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on puerto rico residential properties and the hfa insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions the corporation also had at september million in bonds issued by hfa which are secured by second mortgage loans on puerto rico residential properties and for which hfa also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions december million in the event that the mortgage loans insured by hfa and held by the corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the hfa bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of this loans hfas ability to honor its insurance will depend among other factors on the financial condition of hfa at the time such obligations become due and payable the corporation does not consider the government guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated with this portfolio although the governor is currently authorized by local legislation to impose a temporary moratorium on the financial obligations of the hfa she has not exercised this power as of the date hereof in addition at september the corporation had million of commercial real estate notes issued by government entities but that are payable from rent paid by nongovernmental parties december million on january the corporation received a payment amounting to million upon the maturity of securities issued by hfa which had been economically defeased and refunded and for which securities consisting of us agencies and treasury obligations had been escrowed december million bpprs commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers lessors suppliers or have other relationships with the government these borrowers could be negatively affected by the fiscal measures to be implemented to address the commonwealths fiscal crisis and the ongoing title iii proceedings under promesa described above similarly bpprs mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to current and former government employees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs or reductions in pension benefits bppr also has a significant amount of deposits from the commonwealth its instrumentalities and municipalities the amount of such deposits may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and liquidity of such entities as well as on the ability of bppr to maintain these customer relationships the corporation may also have direct exposure with regards to avoidance and other causes of action initiated by the oversight board on behalf of the commonwealth or other title iii debtors for additional information regarding such exposure refer to note of the consolidated financial statements united states virgin islands the corporation has operations in the united states virgin islands the usvi and has credit exposure to usvi government entities the usvi has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges which have been and maybe be further exacerbated as a result of the effects of the covid19 pandemic that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations promesa does not apply to the usvi and as such there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the usvi and its public corporations and instrumentalities to the extent that the fiscal condition of the usvi continues to deteriorate the us congress or the government of the usvi may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of usvi government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies including by making promesa applicable to the usvi at september the corporations direct exposure to usvi instrumentalities and public corporations amounted to approximately million of which million is outstanding compared to million and million respectively at december of the amount outstanding approximately i million represents loans to the west indian company ltd a governmentowned company that

been negatively affected by the covid19 pandemic particularly as a reduction in the tourism activity which accounts for a significant portion of its economy although the corporation has no significant exposure to a single borrower in the bvi it has a loan portfolio amounting to approximately million comprised of various retail and commercial clients including a loan of approximately million with the government of the bvi us government as further detailed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements a substantial portion of the corporations investment securities represented exposure

quality metrics is presented in table the corporation adopted the cecl accounting standard effective january this framework requires management to estimate credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the loan using economic forecasts over a reasonable and supportable period and historical information thereafter the corporations credit performance remained stable during the third

the next several quarters at september total nonperforming assets npas increased by million when compared with december total nonperforming loans heldinportfolio increased by million from december impacted by the adoption of the cecl methodology during the first quarter of following existing accounting guidance purchased credit impaired pci loans were excluded from nonperforming status due to

status bpprs npls increased by million mostly related to the pci loans transition impact of million while popular banks npls increased by million excluding this impact bpprs npls decreased by million mainly due to lower mortgage and consumer npls of million and million respectively aided by payment deferrals government stimulus measures and the resumption of collection efforts these npl reductions

for credit losses acl represents managements estimate of expected credit losses through the remaining contractual life of the different loan segments impacted by expected prepayments the acl is maintained at a sufficient level to provide for estimated credit losses on collateral dependent loans as well as troubled debt restructurings separately from the remainder of the loan portfolio the corporations management evaluates the adequacy of the acl on a quarterly basis in this evaluation management considers current conditions macroeconomic economic expectations through a reasonable and supportable period historical loss experience portfolio composition by loan type and risk characteristics results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans and regulatory requirements amongst other factors the corporation must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic developments affecting specific customers industries or markets other factors that can affect managements estimates are recalibration of statistical models used to calculate lifetime expected losses changes in underwriting standards financial accounting standards and loan impairment measurements among others changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers in economic conditions and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may also affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses consequently the business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations could also be affected refer to note summary of significant accounting policies included in this form 10q for a description of the corporations allowance for credit losses methodology at september the allowance for credit losses increased by million from the fourth quarter of to million mostly related to the cecl adoption impact in the first quarter of of million day impact in the allowance for credit losses

first quarter of related to the pandemic amounted to million for the third quarter of the acl incorporated the current economic outlook using moodys analytics september scenarios as well as the effect of the credit risk rating downgrades of certain commercial borrowers during the quarter the hotel industry representing the largest impacted segment as discussed in note to the consolidated financial

alternative scenarios in addition to the changes within the baseline scenario when compared to moodys second quarter baseline scenario resulted in an increase in estimated reserves of approximately

respectively aided by the pandemic relief programs as well as the resumption of collection and repossession activity the corporation continues to be attentive to changes in delinquencies and ncos as most deferrals expired during the third quarter of and given the uncertainty around the outlook of the pandemic troubled debt restructurings the corporations tdr loans amounted to billion at september increasing by million from december mainly due to borrowers that needed additional covid19 extensions past the original 6month moratorium window tdrs in the bppr segment increased by million mostly driven by higher mortgage tdrs of million coupled with a combined increase of million in the commercial and construction portfolios at september the mortgage tdr loans include million guaranteed by us

since march the corporation has entered into loan modifications with eligible customers in mortgage personal loans credit cards auto loans and leases and certain commercial credit facilities comprised mainly of payment deferrals of up to six months subject to certain terms and conditions in addition certain participating clients impacted by the seismic activity in the southern region of the island also benefitted from other loan payment moratoriums offered by the corporation since midjanuary these loan modifications do not affect the asset quality measures as the deferred payments are not deemed to be delinquent and the corporation continues to accrue interest on these loans the puerto rico legislative assembly enacted legislation in april that required financial institutions to offer through june moratoriums on consumer financial products to clients impacted by the covid19 pandemic and in july extended the relief with respect to mortgage products through august the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act signed by the president of the united states as part of an economic stimulus package provided relief related to us gaap requirements for loan modifications related to covid19 relief measures in addition the federal reserve along with other us banking regulators also issued interagency guidance to financial institutions that offers some practical expedients for evaluating whether loan modifications that occur in response to the covid19 pandemic are tdrs according to the interagency guidance covid19 related shortterm modifications ie six months or less granted to consumer or commercial loans that were current as of the date of the loan modification are not tdrs since the lender can conclude that the borrower is current on their loan and thus not experiencing financial difficulties and furthermore the period of the deferral granted does not represent a more than insignificant concession on the part of the lender in addition a modification or deferral program that is mandated by the federal government or a state government eg a state program that requires all institutions within that state to suspend mortgage payments for a specified period does not represent a tdr out of the approximately billion in loans modified under this program approximately million have been classified as tdrs in making this determination the corporation considered the criteria of whether the borrower was in financial difficulty at the time of the deferral and whether the deferral period was more than insignificant as discussed above at september of covid19 payment deferrals had expired after excluding government guaranteed mortgage loans that are still pending to complete their covid19 related modifications of the remaining loans were current on their payments as of quarter end given the recent expiration of the payment moratorium the corporation will continue to monitor and assess the postmoratorium payment behavior of these borrowers to
