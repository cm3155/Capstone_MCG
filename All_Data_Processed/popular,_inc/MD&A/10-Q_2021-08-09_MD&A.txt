interest income is subject to various categories of interest rate risk including repricing basis yield curve and option risks in managing interest rate risk management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities change pricing schedules adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities and enter into derivative contracts among other alternatives interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position given line of business forecasts management objectives market expectations and policy constraints management utilizes various tools to assess irr including net interest income nii simulation modeling static gap analysis and economic value of equity eve the three methodologies complement each other and are used jointly in the evaluation of the corporations irr nii simulation modeling is prepared for a fiveyear period which in conjunction with the eve analysis provides management a better view of longterm irr net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various nii simulations under different interest rate scenarios that differ in direction of interest rate changes the degree of change and the projected shape of the yield curve for example the types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat rates implied forwards and parallel and nonparallel rate shocks management also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures the asset and liability management group perform validation procedures on various assumptions used as part of the simulation analyses as well as validations of results on a monthly basis in addition the model and processes used to assess irr are subject to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the model governance and validation policy the corporation processes nii simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline by the same amount parallel shifts the rate scenarios considered in these market risk simulations reflect instantaneous parallel changes of and basis points during the succeeding twelvemonth period simulation analyses are based on many assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points and indexes interest rate spreads loan prepayments and deposit elasticity thus they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results further the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in interest rates by their nature these forwardlooking computations are only estimates and may be different from what may actually occur in the future the following table presents the results of the simulations at june and december assuming a static balance sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over a oneyear time horizon table net interest income sensitivity one year projection june december  in thousands amount change percent change amount change percent change change in interest rate basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points as of june nii simulations show the corporation maintains an asset sensitive position and is expected to benefit from an overall rising rate environment the increases in sensitivity for the period are primarily driven by significant deposit increases which have increased the level of cash reserves maintained at the federal reserve these shortterm assets reprice immediately thus increasing the nii benefit in rising rate scenarios the declining rate scenarios show a smaller impact in sensitivity as rates continue to be close to their lower bound and popular does not allow rates to turn negative in its irr simulations the corporations loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk which results from the ability of a thirdparty to repay debt obligations prior to maturity prepayment risk also could have a significant impact on the duration of mortgagebacked securities and collateralized mortgage obligations since prepayments could shorten or lower prepayments could extend the weighted

measures the maximum estimated loss that may occur over a 5day holding period given a probability the corporations trading portfolio had a 5day var of approximately million for the last week in june there are numerous assumptions and estimates associated with var modeling and actual results could differ from these assumptions and estimates backtesting is performed to compare actual results against maximum estimated losses in order to evaluate model and assumptions accuracy in the opinion of management the size and composition of the trading portfolio does not represent a significant source of market risk for the corporation liquidity the objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that the corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations finance expected future growth fund planned capital distributions and maintain a reasonable safety margin for cash commitments under both normal and stressed market conditions the board of directors is responsible for establishing the corporations tolerance for liquidity risk including approving relevant risk limits and policies the board of directors has delegated the monitoring of these risks to the boards risk management committee and the assetliability management committee the management of liquidity risk on a longterm and daytoday basis is the responsibility of the corporate treasury division the corporations corporate treasurer is responsible for implementing the policies and procedures approved by the board of directors and for monitoring the corporations liquidity position on an ongoing basis also the corporate treasury division coordinates corporate wide liquidity management strategies and activities with the reportable segments oversees policy breaches and manages the escalation process the financial and operational risk management division is responsible for the independent monitoring and reporting of adherence with established policies an institutions liquidity may be pressured if for example it experiences a sudden and unexpected substantial cash outflow due to exogenous events such as the current covid19 pandemic its credit rating is downgraded or some other event causes counterparties to avoid exposure to the institution factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook adverse ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding liquidity is managed by the corporation at the level of the holding companies that own the banking and nonbanking subsidiaries it is also managed at the level of the banking and nonbanking subsidiaries as further explained below a principal source of liquidity for the bank holding companies the bhcs are dividends received from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries the corporation has adopted policies and limits to monitor more effectively the corporations liquidity position and that of the banking subsidiaries additionally contingency funding plans are used to model various stress events of different magnitudes and affecting different time horizons that assist management in evaluating the size of the liquidity buffers needed if those stress events occur however such models may not predict accurately how the market and customers might react to every event and are dependent on many assumptions deposits including customer deposits brokered deposits and public funds deposits continue to be the most significant source of funds for the corporation funding of the corporations total assets at june and at december the ratio of total ending loans to deposits was at june compared to at december in addition to traditional deposits the corporation maintains borrowing arrangements which amounted to approximately billion in outstanding balances at june and december a detailed description of the corporations borrowings including their terms is included in note to the consolidated financial statements also the consolidated statements of cash flows in the accompanying consolidated financial statements provide information on the corporations cash inflows and outflows the following sections provide further information on the corporations major funding activities and needs as well as the risks involved in these activities banking subsidiaries primary sources of funding for the corporations banking subsidiaries bppr and pb or collectively the banking subsidiaries include retail commercial and public sector deposits brokered deposits unpledged investment securities mortgage loan securitization and to a lesser extent loan sales in addition the corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the fhlb and at the discount window of the federal reserve bank of new york the frb and has a considerable amount of collateral pledged that can be used to raise funds under these facilities refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information of the corporations borrowing facilities available through its banking subsidiaries the principal uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include loan originations investment portfolio purchases loan purchases and repurchases repayment of outstanding obligations including deposits advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational expenses also the banking subsidiaries assume liquidity risk related to collateral posting requirements for certain activities mainly in connection with contractual commitments recourse provisions servicing advances derivatives credit card licensing agreements and support to several mutual funds administered by bppr the banking subsidiaries maintain sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows the corporation has established liquidity guidelines that require the banking subsidiaries to have sufficient liquidity to cover all shortterm borrowings and a portion of deposits the corporations ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits excluding brokered deposits depends on various factors including pricing service convenience and financial stability as reflected by operating results credit ratings by nationally recognized credit rating agencies and importantly fdic deposit insurance although a downgrade in the credit ratings of the corporations banking subsidiaries may impact their ability to raise retail and commercial deposits or the rate that it is required to pay on such deposits management does not believe that the impact should be material deposits at all of the corporations banking subsidiaries are federally insured subject to fdic limits and this is expected to mitigate the potential effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings deposits are a key source of funding as they tend to be less volatile than institutional borrowings and their cost is less sensitive to changes in market rates refer to table for a breakdown of deposits by major types core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and public sector customers core deposits include all noninterest bearing deposits savings deposits and certificates of deposit under excluding brokered deposits with denominations under core deposits have historically provided the corporation with a sizable source of relatively stable and lowcost funds core deposits totaled billion or of total deposits at june compared with billion or of total deposits at december core deposits financed of the corporations earning assets at june compared with at december the distribution by maturity of certificates of deposits with denominations of and over at june is presented in the table that follows table distribution by maturity of certificate of deposits of and over in thousands months or less to months to months over months total the corporation had billion in brokered deposits at june which financed approximately of its total assets december billion and respectively in the event that any of the corporations banking subsidiaries regulatory capital ratios fall below those required by a wellcapitalized institution or are subject to capital restrictions by the regulators that banking subsidiary faces the risk of not being able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and faces limitations on the rate paid on deposits which may hinder the corporations ability to effectively compete in its retail markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts deposits from the public sector represent an important source of funds for the corporation as of june total public sector deposits were billion compared to billion at december generally these deposits require that the bank pledge high credit quality securities as collateral therefore liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower given that the bank receives its collateral in return this now unpledged collateral can either be financed via repurchase agreements or sold for cash however there are some timing differences between the time the deposit outflow occurs and when the bank receives its collateral at june management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources to meet their anticipated cash flow obligations as well as special needs and offbalance sheet commitments in the ordinary course of business and have sufficient liquidity resources to address a stress event although the banking subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances no assurance can be given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if the corporations financial condition or general market conditions were to deteriorate the corporations financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates the banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements to the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of market changes the corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements thereby adversely affecting its liquidity finally if management is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to meet its future growth revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs in this case profitability would be adversely affected bank holding companies the principal sources of funding for the bhcs which are popular inc holding company only and pna include cash on hand investment securities dividends received from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries asset sales credit facilities available from affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings dividends from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory limits and authorization requirements that are further described below and that may limit the ability of those subsidiaries to act as a source of funding to the bhcs the principal use of these funds includes the repayment of debt and interest payments to holders of senior debt and junior subordinated deferrable interest related to trust preferred securities the payment of dividends to common stockholders and capitalizing its banking subsidiaries the bhcs have in the past borrowed in the money markets and in the corporate debt market primarily to finance their nonbanking subsidiaries however the cash needs of the corporations nonbanking subsidiaries other than to repay indebtedness and interest are now minimal these sources of funding are more costly due to the fact that two out of the three principal credit rating agencies rate the corporation below investment grade which affects the corporations cost and ability to raise funds in the capital markets the corporation has an automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the securities and exchange commission which permits the corporation to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities the outstanding balance of notes payable at the bhcs amounted to million at june and december the contractual maturities of the bhcs notes payable at june are presented in table table distribution of bhcs notes payable by contractual maturity year in thousands later years total annual debt service at the bhcs is approximately million and the corporations latest quarterly dividend was per share for a total of million for the quarter ended june the bhcs liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash on hand investments and other sources of liquidity which are expected to be enough to meet all bhcs obligations during the foreseeable future as of june the bhcs had cash and money markets investments totaling million borrowing potential of million from its secured facility with bppr in addition to these liquidity sources the stake in evertec had a market value of million as of june and it represents an additional source of contingent liquidity nonbanking subsidiaries the principal sources of funding for the nonbanking subsidiaries include internally generated cash flows from operations loan sales repurchase agreements capital injections and borrowed funds from their direct parent companies or the holding companies the principal uses of funds for the nonbanking subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt operational expenses and payment of dividends to the bhcs the liquidity needs of the nonbanking subsidiaries are minimal since most of them are funded internally from operating cash flows or from intercompany borrowings or

subsidiaries and million in dividends from evertec dividends from bppr constitute popular incs primary source of liquidity other funding sources and capital the debt securities portfolio provides an additional source of liquidity which may be realized through either securities sales or repurchase agreements the corporations debt securities portfolio consists primarily of liquid us government debt securities us government sponsored agency debt securities us government sponsored agency mortgagebacked securities and us government sponsored agency collateralized mortgage obligations that can be used to raise funds in the repo markets the availability of the repurchase agreement would be subject to having sufficient unpledged collateral available at the time the transactions are to be consummated in addition to overall liquidity and risk appetite of the various counterparties the corporations unpledged debt securities amounted to billion at june and billion at december a substantial portion of these debt securities could be used to raise financing in the us money markets or from secured lending sources additional liquidity may be provided through loan maturities prepayments and sales the loan portfolio can also be used to obtain funding in the capital markets in particular mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans have secondary markets which the

of creditworthiness leverage ratios and other regulatory requirements among other factors derivatives such as those embedded in longterm repurchase transactions or interest rate swaps and offbalance sheet exposures such as recourse performance bonds or credit card arrangements are subject to collateral requirements as their fair value increases the collateral requirements may increase thereby reducing the balance of unpledged securities the importance of the puerto rico market for the corporation is an additional risk factor that could affect its financing activities in the case of a deterioration in economic and fiscal conditions in puerto rico the credit quality of the corporation could be affected and result in higher credit costs refer to the geographic and government risk section of this mda for some highlights on the current status of the puerto rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding in order to prepare for the possibility of such scenario management has adopted contingency plans for raising financing under stress scenarios when important sources of funds that are usually fully available are temporarily unavailable these plans call for using alternate funding mechanisms such as the pledging of certain asset classes and accessing secured credit lines and loan facilities put in place with the fhlb and the frb the credit ratings of populars debt obligations are a relevant factor for liquidity because they impact the corporations ability to borrow in the capital markets its cost and access to funding sources credit ratings are based on the financial strength credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio the level and volatility of earnings capital adequacy the quality of management geographic concentration in puerto rico the liquidity of the balance sheet the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits and the corporations ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources among other factors furthermore various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval a member bank must obtain the approval of the federal reserve board for any dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock in addition a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its report of condition and income unless the member bank has received the approval of the federal reserve board a member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the federal reserve board pursuant to these requirements pb may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the nysdfs the ability of a bank subsidiary to upstream dividends to its bhc could thus be impacted by its financial performance thus potentially limiting the amount of cash moving up to the bhcs from the banking subsidiaries this could in turn affect the bhcs ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock for example the corporations banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations and therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the corporations overall credit ratings obligations subject to rating triggers or collateral requirements the corporations banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings the banking subsidiaries had million in deposits at june that are subject to rating triggers in addition certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that bppr has with third parties include rating covenants in the event of a credit rating downgrade the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits andor increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations also as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements the corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions certain contractual agreements require the corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institutions required credit ratings are not maintained collateral pledged by the corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately million at june the corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed the requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the corporations liquidity resources and impact its operating results credit risk geographic and government risk the corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk the corporations assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements commonwealth of puerto rico a significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the commonwealth of puerto rico the commonwealth or puerto rico which faces severe economic and fiscal challenges covid19 pandemic on december a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 surfaced in wuhan china and has since spread globally to other countries and jurisdictions including the mainland united states and puerto rico in march the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic the pandemic has significantly disrupted and negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains created significant volatility in financial markets and increased unemployment levels worldwide including in the markets in which we do business in puerto rico former governor wanda vázquez issued an executive order in march declaring a health emergency ordering residents to shelter in place implementing a mandatory curfew and requiring the closure of nonessential businesses some of the restrictions including the mandatory curfew remained in place until july when governor pierluisi lifted all remaining restrictions and delegated to the puerto rico secretary of health the authority to issue guidelines and protocols to address the covid19 emergency although many of these restrictive measures have been eased or lifted allowing for the gradual reopening of the economy certain restrictive measures remain in place and additional restrictive measures may be implemented in the future as a result of a resurgence in the spread of the virus or new strains of the virus since the beginning of the pandemic most businesses have had to make significant adjustments to protect customers and employees including transitioning to telework and suspending or modifying certain operations in compliance with health and safety guidelines the puerto rico legislative assembly enacted legislation in april requiring financial institutions to offer moratoriums on consumer financial products to clients impacted by the covid19 pandemic which was effective through august the federal government has also approved several economic stimulus measures that seek to cushion the economic fallout of the pandemic including providing direct subsidies expanding eligibility for and increasing unemployment benefits and guaranteeing through the sba ppp loans to small and medium businesses the covid19 pandemic and the restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the disease have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on economic activity worldwide including in puerto rico the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to adversely affect economic activity will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict including the scope and duration of the pandemic including the appearance of new strains of the virus the restrictions imposed by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the same the pace of global vaccination efforts and the amount of federal and local assistance offered to offset the impact of the pandemic pursuant to the fiscal plan as defined below economic stimulus measures have more than offset the estimated income loss due to reduced economic activity in puerto rico and are estimated to have caused a temporary increase in personal income on a net basis however there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to offset the pandemics economic impact in the medium and longterm for a discussion of the impact of the pandemic on the corporations operations and financial results during the second quarter of refer to the mda significant events section on the

original voting members of the oversight board through the process established in promesa which authorizes the president to select the members from several lists required to be submitted by congressional leaders such appointments process was recently upheld by the us supreme court the terms of the original oversight board members expired in august but promesa allows members to remain in their roles until their successors have been appointed all of the original members continued to serve on the oversight board on holdover status until when president donald trump reappointed three of the original members and appointed four new members to the oversight board in october the oversight board designated the commonwealth and all of its public corporations and instrumentalities as covered entities under promesa the only commonwealth government entities that were not subject to such initial designation were the commonwealths municipalities in may however the oversight board designated all of the commonwealths municipalities as covered entities at the oversight boards request covered entities are required to submit fiscal plans and annual budgets to the oversight board for its review and approval they are also required to seek oversight board approval to issue guarantee or modify their debts and to enter into contracts with an aggregate value of million or more finally covered entities are potentially eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by promesa for additional discussion of risk factors related to the puerto rico fiscal challenges see part i item risk factors in the corporations form 10k for the year ended december fiscal plans commonwealth fiscal plan the oversight board has certified several fiscal plans for the commonwealth since the most recent fiscal plan for the commonwealth certified by the oversight board is dated april the fiscal plan pursuant to the fiscal plan while the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken in response to the same severely reduced economic activity and caused an unprecedented increase in unemployment in puerto rico pandemicrelated federal and local stimulus funding have more than offset the estimated income loss due to reduced economic activity and are estimated to have caused a temporary increase in personal income on a net basis the fiscal plans economic projections incorporate adjustments for these shortterm income effects for purposes of estimating tax receipts for example the fiscal plan estimates that real gnp contracted by in fiscal year but estimates the gnp contraction adjusted for shortterm income effects to have been approximately for fiscal years and the fiscal plan projects that real gnp will grow and respectively but projects that growth adjusted for income effects for such years will be approximately and respectively the fiscal plan projects that if the fiscal measures and structural reforms contemplated by the plan are not successfully implemented the commonwealth will have a precontractual debt service deficit starting in fiscal year it estimates that the fiscal measures could drive approximately billion in savings and extra revenue over fiscal years through and that the structural reforms could drive a cumulative increase in growth by fiscal year equal to approximately billion however even after the fiscal measures and structural reforms and before contractual debt service the fiscal plan projects that there will be an annual deficit starting in fiscal year the fiscal plan provides for the gradual reduction and the ultimate elimination of commonwealth budgetary subsidies to municipalities which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of some municipalities since fiscal year commonwealth appropriations to municipalities have decreased by approximately from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year in response to the covid19 crisis reductions in appropriations to municipalities were paused in fiscal year municipalities have also received extraordinary appropriations and other funds from federallyfunded programs during the current fiscal year which has helped temporarily offset the impact of the reduced commonwealth support however the fiscal plan contemplates additional reductions in appropriations to municipalities starting in fiscal year before eventually phasing out all appropriations in fiscal year further while the commonwealth had enacted legislation in suspending the municipalitys obligations to contribute to the commonwealths health plan and payasyou go retirement system such legislation was challenged by the oversight board and eventually declared null by the title iii court in april as a result municipalities are required to cover their own employees healthcare costs and retirement benefits and had to reimburse the commonwealth for such costs corresponding to the period during which the law in effect finally the fiscal plan notes that municipalities have made little or no progress towards implementing fiscal discipline required to reduce reliance on commonwealth appropriations and that this lack of fiscal management threatens the ability of municipalities to provide necessary services such as health sanitation public safety and emergency services to their residents forcing them to prioritize expenditures other fiscal plans pursuant to promesa the oversight board has also requested and certified fiscal plans for several public corporations and instrumentalities the certified fiscal plan for the puerto rico electric power authority prepa puerto ricos electric power utility contemplated the transformation of puerto ricos electric system through among other things the establishment of a publicprivate partnership with respect to prepas transmission and distribution system the td system and calls for significant structural reforms at prepa the procurement process for the establishment of a publicprivate partnership with respect to the td system was completed in june the selected proponent luma energy llc luma and prepa entered into a 15year agreement whereby since june luma is responsible for operating maintaining and modernizing the td system on april the oversight board certified the latest version of the fiscal plan the crim fiscal plan for the municipal revenue collection center crim the government entity responsible for collecting property taxes and distributing them among the municipalities the crim fiscal plan outlines a series of measures centered around improving the competitiveness of puerto ricos property tax regime and the enhancement of property tax collections including identifying and appraising new properties as well as improvements to existing properties and implementing operational and technological initiatives pending title iii proceedings on may the oversight board on behalf of the commonwealth filed a petition in the us district court to restructure the commonwealths liabilities under title iii of promesa the oversight board has subsequently filed analogous petitions with respect to the puerto rico sales tax financing corporation cofina the employees retirement system of the government of the commonwealth of puerto rico ers the puerto rico highways and transportation authority prepa and the puerto rico public buildings authority pba on february the government completed a restructuring of cofinas debts pursuant to a plan of adjustment confirmed by the us district court on july the oversight board filed the sixth amended title iii joint plan of adjustment for the commonwealth et al the proposed plan in the pending debt restructuring proceedings under title iii of promesa the proposed plan which has substantial support from several creditor constituencies but is still subject to confirmation in the title iii proceeding seeks to restructure approximately billion of debt and other claims against the commonwealth pba and ers and more than billion of unfunded pension liabilities on july the title iii court approved the disclosure statement for the proposed plan the oversight board has proposed that final hearings on confirmation of a plan of adjustment take place in november seismic activity on january puerto rico was struck by a magnitude earthquake which caused islandwide power outages and significant damage to infrastructure and property in the southwest region of the island the earthquake was preceded by foreshocks and followed by aftershocks the commonwealths government has estimated total earthquakerelated damages at approximately billion exposure of the corporation the credit quality of bpprs loan portfolio reflects among other things the general economic conditions in puerto rico and other adverse conditions affecting puerto rico consumers and businesses the effects of the prolonged recession have been reflected in limited loan demand an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in puerto rico while promesa provided a process to address the commonwealths fiscal crisis the complexity and uncertainty of the title iii proceedings for the commonwealth and various of its instrumentalities and the adjustment measures required by the fiscal plans still present significant economic risks in addition the covid19 outbreak has affected many of our individual customers and customers businesses this when added to puerto ricos ongoing fiscal crisis and recession could cause credit losses that adversely affect us and may negatively affect consumer confidence result in reductions in consumer spending and adversely impact our interest and noninterest revenues if global or local economic conditions worsen or the government of puerto rico and the oversight board are unable to adequately manage the commonwealths fiscal and economic challenges including by controlling the covid19 pandemic and consummating an orderly restructuring of the commonwealths debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services these adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict at june and december the corporations direct exposure to the puerto rico governments instrumentalities and municipalities totaled million and million respectively which amounts were fully outstanding on such dates further deterioration of the commonwealths fiscal and economic situation could adversely affect the value of our puerto rico government obligations resulting in losses to us of the amount

rico municipalities in most cases these were general obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith credit and unlimited taxing power or special

million these mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on puerto rico residential properties and the hfa insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions the corporation also had at june million in bonds issued by hfa which are secured by second mortgage loans on puerto rico residential properties and for which hfa also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions december million in the event that the mortgage loans insured by hfa and held by the corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the hfa bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of this loans hfas ability to honor its insurance will depend among other factors on the financial condition of hfa at the time such obligations become due and payable the corporation does not consider the government guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated with this portfolio although the governor is currently authorized by local legislation to impose a temporary moratorium on the financial obligations of the hfa a moratorium on such obligations has not been imposed as of the date hereof in addition at june the corporation had million of commercial real estate notes issued by government entities but that are payable from rent paid by nongovernmental parties december million bpprs commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers lessors suppliers or have other

in pension benefits bppr also has a significant amount of deposits from the commonwealth its instrumentalities and municipalities the amount of such deposits may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and liquidity of such entities as well as on the ability of bppr to maintain these customer relationships the corporation may also have direct exposure with regards to avoidance and other

restructuring of the debts of the usvi and its public corporations and instrumentalities to the extent that the fiscal condition of the usvi continues to deteriorate the us congress or the government

estimate of expected credit losses through the remaining contractual life of the different loan segments impacted by expected prepayments the acl is maintained at a sufficient level to provide for

the acl on a quarterly basis in this evaluation management considers current conditions macroeconomic economic expectations through a reasonable and supportable period historical loss experience portfolio composition by loan type and risk characteristics results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans and regulatory requirements amongst other factors the corporation must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic developments affecting specific customers industries or markets other factors that can affect managements estimates are recalibration of statistical models used to calculate lifetime expected losses changes in underwriting standards financial accounting standards and loan impairment measurements among others changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers in economic conditions and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may also affect
