item risk factors in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed under part i item risk factors in our form10k and under part iiitem1a risk factors of any subsequent quarterly report on form10qthese factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and capital position and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report also refer to the discussion in part i item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report for additional information that may supplement or update the discussion of the risk factors below and in our form10k and any subsequent quarterly reports on form10q the risks described in our form 10k and in our quarterly reports on form 10q are not the only risks facing us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and capital position there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under part i item a risk factors in our form 10k except for the risks included below which supplement the risk factors described in our form 10k risk factors complying with economic and trade sanctions programs and antimoney laundering laws and regulations can increase our operational and compliance costs and risks if we and our subsidiaries affiliates or thirdparty service providers are found to have failed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs and antimoney laundering laws and regulations we could be exposed to fines sanctions and penalties and other regulatory actions as well as governmental investigations as a federally regulated financial institution we must comply with regulations and economic and trade sanctions and embargo programs administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac of the us treasury as well as antimoney laundering laws and regulations including those under the bank secrecy act economic and trade sanctions regulations and programs administered by ofac prohibit usbased entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with for the benefit of or in some cases involving the property and property interests of persons governments or countries designated by the us government under one or more sanctions regimes and also prohibit transactions that provide a benefit that is received in a country designated under one or more sanctions regimes we are also subject to a variety of reporting and other requirements under the bank secrecy act including the requirement to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports that are designed to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering terrorist financing and other criminal activities in addition as a financial institution we are required to among other things identify our customers adopt formal and comprehensive antimoney laundering programs scrutinize or altogether prohibit certain transactions of special concern and be prepared to respond to inquiries from us law enforcement agencies concerning our customers and their transactions failure by the corporation its subsidiaries affiliates or thirdparty service providers to comply with these laws and regulations could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the corporation including the possibility of regulatory enforcement or other legal action including significant civil and criminal penalties we can also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating our businesses to comply with these requirements the markets in which we operate heighten these costs and risks we have established riskbased policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with these applicable laws and regulations with respect to ofac regulations and economic and trade sanction programs these policies and procedures employ software to screen transactions for evidence of sanctionedcountry and persons involvement consistent with a riskbased approach and the difficulties in identifying and where applicable blocking and rejecting transactions of our customers or our customers customers that may involve a sanctioned person government or country there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which we engage and such violations could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we have identified and voluntarily selfdisclosed to ofac transactions that were not timely identified blocked or rejected by our policies controls and procedures for screening transactions that might violate the regulations and economic and trade sanctions programs administered by ofac for example during the second quarter of bppr entered into a settlement agreement with ofac with respect to certain transactions processed on behalf of two employees of the government of venezuela in apparent violation of us sanctions against venezuela popular agreed to pay approximately to settle the apparent violations which had been selfdisclosed to ofac there can be no assurances that any failure to comply with us sanctions and embargoes or with antimoney laundering laws and regulations will not result in material fines sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us furthermore if the policies controls and procedures of one of the corporations thirdparty service providers do not prevent it from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which it engages such violations could adversely affect its ability to provide services to us we are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that if realized may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations these cybersecurity risks have been heightened by the increase on our employees remote work capabilities the use of digital channels by our customers as a result of the covid19 pandemic and growing economic and geopolitical risks information security risks for large financial institutions such as popular have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as internet and mobile banking to conduct instant financial transactions anywhere globally growing geopolitical threats such as the ongoing russian conflict in ukraine and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates hacktivists and other parties in the ordinary course of business we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to transmit and store sensitive data we employ a layered defensive approach that employs people processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls through a variety of preventative and detective tools that monitor block and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity and identify suspected advanced persistent threats notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to protect the security of our systems there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective at all times especially as the threats from cyberattacks is continuous and severe the risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future as we continue to expand our mobile banking and other internetbased product offerings populars use of the cloud for system development and hosting and internal use of internetbased products and applications we continue to detect and identify attacks that are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume as well as attackers that respond rapidly to changes in defensive countermeasures the most significant cyberattack risks that we may face are efraud denialofservice ddos ransomware computer intrusion and the exploitation of software zeroday vulnerabilities that might result in disruption of services and in the exposure or loss of customer or proprietary data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals compromise our systems or the systems of our customers and extract funds from customers credit cards or bank accounts including through brute force password spraying and credential stuffing attacks directed at gaining unauthorized access to individual accounts denialofservice attacks intentionally disrupt the ability of legitimate users including customers and employees to access networks websites and online resources computer intrusion attempts either direct or through email text or voice messages including using brand impersonation regularly referred to as phishing vishing and smishing might result in the compromise of sensitive customer data such as account numbers credit cards and social security numbers and could present significant reputational legal and regulatory costs to popular if successful we have been the target of phishing smishing and vishing attacks in the past targeting both our customers and employees through brand email text and voicemail impersonation that have compromised the email accounts of certain of our customers and employees or have resulted in our customers being deceived into revealing their information to attackers we continually monitor and address those vulnerabilities and continue to enhance our security measures to detect and prevent such incidents while enhancing employee and customer trainings and awareness campaigns there can be no assurances however that there will not be further compromises of sensitive customer information in the future our customerfacing platforms are also routinely attacked by threat actors aiming to gain unauthorized access to our clients accounts popular has recently implemented certain defensive measures in response to brute force attacks on one of our platforms and while our investigation of these brute force attacks remains ongoing we have to date not experienced material losses in connection with these attacks cybersecurity risks have also been recently exacerbated by the discovery of zeroday vulnerabilities in widely distributed third party software such as the vulnerability identified in december in the apache log4j which could affect populars or any of its service providers systems the increased use of remote access and thirdparty video conferencing solutions during the covid19 pandemic to enable workfromhome arrangements for employees and facilitating the use of digital channels by our customers has increased our exposure to cyber attacks in addition a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by populars customers or employees recent events including the russian conflict in ukraine have also illustrated increased geopolitical factors and the risks related to supplychain compromises and destabilizing activities linked to nationstate sponsored activity as an increasing trend to monitor actively risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats including the rise in the use of cyberattacks as geopolitical weapons as well as the expanding use of digital channels for banking such as mobile banking and other technologybased products and services used by us and our customers although we are regularly targeted by unauthorized threatactor activity we have not to date experienced any material losses as a result of any cyberattacks a successful compromise or circumvention of the security of our systems could have serious negative consequences for us including significant disruption of our operations and those of our clients customers and counterparties misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients customers counterparties or employees or damage to computers or systems used by us or by our clients customers and counterparties and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to us or to our customers loss of confidence in our security measures customer dissatisfaction significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on us for example if personal nonpublic confidential or proprietary information in our possession were to be mishandled misused or stolen we could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss the extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed while such an investigation is ongoing popular may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack and that damage may continue to spread these factors may inhibit our ability to provide rapid full and reliable information about the cyber attack to our clients customers counterparties and regulators as well as the public furthermore it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the potential harm caused by the cyber attack and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated any or all of these factors could further increase the impact of the incident and thereby the costs and consequences of a cyber attack for a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards see regulation and supervision in part i item business included in the form 10k for the year ended december such mishandling or misuse could include for example if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either by fault of our systems employees or counterparties or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties we also rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information security technology and business process services as a result a successful compromise or circumvention of the security of the systems of these thirdparty service providers could have serious negative consequences for us including misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients customers counterparties or employees or other negative implications identified above with respect to a cyberattack on our systems which could have a material adverse effect on us the most important of these thirdparty service providers for us is evertec and certain risks particular to evertec are discussed under risks relating to our relationship with evertec during we determined that as a result of the widely reported breach of accellion incs file transfer appliance tool which was being used at the time of such breach by a usbased thirdparty advisory services vendor of popular personal information of certain popular customers was compromised as a result popular notified as required or otherwise deemed appropriate customers identified as affected by the incident although we are not aware of fraudulent activity in connection with this incident populars networks and systems were not impacted and our thirdparty service provider agreed to cover external remediation costs associated with the incident a compromise of the personal information of our customers maintained by third party vendors could result in significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss to us the success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these and other third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties suppliers or vendors socalled fourth party risk we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourthparty risk in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents system enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones including risks associated with supply chain compromises and the software development lifecycle of the systems used by us and our service providers due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in addition addressing certain information security vulnerabilities such as hardwarebased vulnerabilities may affect the performance of our information technology systems the ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors moreover our ability to timely mitigate vulnerabilities and manage such risks given the rise in number of required patches and thirdparty software zeroday vulnerabilities may impact our daytoday operations the availability of our systems and delay the deployment of technology enhancements and innovation if populars operational systems or those of external parties on which populars businesses depend are unable to meet the requirements of our businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings popular could be materially and adversely affected we are dependent on evertec for certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology and security services which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us in connection with the sale of a ownership interest in evertec in the third quarter of we entered into a longterm amended and restated master services agreement the original msa with evertec pursuant to which we agreed to receive from evertec on an exclusive basis certain core banking and financial transaction processing and information technology and security services as previously disclosed in our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on july on july the evertec closing we closed the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement dated february by and among evertec evertec group llc bppr and popular pursuant to which we purchased from evertec certain information technology and related assets used by evertec to service certain of bpprs key channels the acquired assets and assumed certain liabilities relating thereto the evertec transaction on the evertec closing the parties to the evertec transaction also amended and restated certain commercial agreements including the original msa the second ar msa pursuant to which evertec will continue to provide various necessary financial transaction processing security and technology services to popular bppr and their respective subsidiaries which services were previously provided under the original msa the term of the second ar msa will expire on september a threeyear extension of the term of the original msa we also amended and restated the agreement pursuant to which bppr sponsors evertec as an independent sales organization with respect to certain credit card associations which contains certain exclusivity and nonsolicitation restrictions with respect to merchant services the iso agreement as well as the agreement pursuant to which bppr has committed to support the ath brand and network the ath agreement although the evertec transaction narrowed the scope of services which we are dependent on evertec to obtain and released us from exclusivity restrictions that limited our ability to engage other thirdparty providers of financial technology services we continue to be dependent on evertec for the provision of essential services to our business including our core banking business and there can be no assurances that the quality of the services will be appropriate or that evertec will be able to continue to provide us with the necessary financial transaction processing security and technology services as a result our relationship with evertec exposes us to operational cybersecurity and business risks that could have a material adverse effect on us as a result of our agreements with evertec we are particularly exposed to the operational risks of evertec including those relating to a breakdown or failure of evertecs systems or internal controls environment including as a result of security breaches or attacks employee error or malfeasance system breakdowns vulnerabilities obsolescence or otherwise over the term of the original msa we experienced various interruptions and delays in key services provided by evertec as well as cyber breaches as a result of system breakdowns misconfigurations and instances of application obsolescence which has led in the past to exposure of bppr customer information there can be no assurances that there will not be further compromises of sensitive customer information in the future because of the aforementioned causes the continuance or increase in service delays or interruptions vulnerabilities in evertecs information systems or cyberattacks to or breaches to the confidentiality of the information that resides in such systems could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services expose us to regulatory legal and compliance risk and damage our reputation which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations evertecs inability to timely address evolving cybersecurity threats may further exacerbate these risks for further information regarding our cybersecurity risks refer to the we are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that if realized could adversely affect how we conduct our business risk factor our ability to recover from evertec for breach of the second ar msa including the failure to meet the service levels or comply with other obligations regarding information security provided for therein may not fully compensate us for the damages we may suffer as a result of such breach popular faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry considering our continued dependence on evertec if evertec is unable to meet constant technological changes and react quickly to meet new industry standards we may be unable to enhance our current services and introduce new products and services in a timely and costeffective manner placing us at a competitive disadvantage and significantly affecting our business financial condition and results of operations we operate in a highly competitive environment in which we must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of technological advances for example technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products we compete on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered innovation price ease of use reputation and transaction execution to compete effectively we need to constantly enhance and modify our products and services and introduce new products and services to attract and retain clients or to match products and services offered by our competitors including technology companies and other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services although the evertec transaction eliminated certain provisions of the original msa that required us to use evertec exclusively to develop and implement new or enhanced products and services and is expected to improve populars ability to manage and control the development of the customer channels supported by the acquired assets popular expects that it will continue to depend on evertecs technology services to operate and control current products and services and to implement future products and services making our success dependent on evertecs ability to timely complete and introduce these enhancements and new products and services in a costeffective manner our ability to enhance our customer channels is also dependent on evertec timely delivering core application programming interfaces the core apis that meet bpprs requirements which evertec has committed to develop under the second ar msa the core apis are necessary for bppr to connect future enhancements to the acquired assets to existing evertec core applications some of our competitors rely on financial services technology and outsourcing companies that are much larger than evertec serve a greater number of clients than evertec and may have better technological capabilities and product offerings than evertec furthermore financial services technology companies typically make capital investments to develop and modify their product and service offerings to facilitate their customers compliance with the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements and in most cases such costs are borne by the technology provider because of our contractual relationship with evertec and because popular is the sole customer of certain of evertecs services and products we have in the past borne the full cost of such developments and modifications and may be required to do so in the future subject to the terms of the second ar msa moreover the terms speed scalability and functionality of certain of evertecs technology services are not competitive when compared to offerings from its competitors evertecs failure to sufficiently invest in and upscale its technology and services infrastructure to meet the rapidly changing technology demands of our industry may result in us being unable to meet customer expectations and attract or retain customers any such impact could in turn reduce populars revenues place us in a competitive disadvantage and significantly affect our business financial condition and results of operations while the closing of the evertec transaction narrowed the scope of services which we are dependent on evertec to obtain and released us from exclusivity restrictions that limited our ability to engage other thirdparty providers of financial technology services it also resulted in extensions of certain existing commercial agreements with evertec and as a result have prolonged the duration of our exposure to the risks presented by evertecs technological capabilities and its failures to enhance its products and services and otherwise meet evolving demands the transition to new financial services technology providers and the replacement of services currently provided to us by evertec will be lengthy and complex switching from one vendor of core bank processing and related technology and security services to a new vendor is a complex process that carries business and financial risks the implementation cycle for such a transition can be lengthy and require significant financial and management resources from us such a transition can also expose us and our clients to increased costs including conversion costs business disruption as well as operational and cybersecurity risks upon the transition of all or a portion of existing services provided by evertec to a new financial services technology provider either i at the end of the term of the second ar msa and related agreements or ii earlier upon the termination of any service for convenience under the second ar msa these transition risks could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although evertec has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to us in connection with the termination of the second ar msa we are ultimately dependent on their ability to provide those services in a responsive and competent manner furthermore we may require transition assistance from evertec beyond the term of the second ar msa delaying and lengthening any transition process away from evertec while increasing related costs under the second ar msa we are able to terminate services for convenience with day prior notice we expect to exercise during the term of the second ar msa the right to terminate certain services for convenience and to transition such services to other service providers prior to the expiration of the second ar msa subject to complying with the revenue minimums contemplated in the second ar msa and certain other conditions in practice in order to switch to a new provider for a particular service we will have to commence procuring and working on a transition process for such service significantly in advance of its termination and in any case much earlier than the automatic renewal notice date or the expiration date of the second ar msa and such process may extend beyond the current term of the second ar msa furthermore if we were unsuccessful or decided not to complete the transition after expending significant funds and management resources it could also result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to additional risks relating to the evertec transaction there are numerous additional risks and uncertainties associated with the evertec transaction including unforeseen events including the covid19 pandemic may materially diminish the expected benefits of the evertec transaction we will be required to devote significant attention and resources to post closing implementation efforts which will involve a significant degree of technological complexity and reliance on evertec and other third parties including with respect to the setup of developer tools required to manage the acquired assets we may be unable to retain the employees and thirdparty contractors hired or engaged by us in connection with the evertec transaction and who are necessary to operate and integrate the acquired assets we may be subject to incremental operational and security risks arising from the transfer of the acquired assets to bppr including those risks arising from among other things the activities required to execute network segmentation the possibility of misconfiguration of access or security services during the transition period and during the implementation of new processes or security controls the possibility of mismanagement of security services during the transition phase and the need to develop a robust internal control framework the anticipated benefits of the evertec transaction could be limited if evertec fails to deliver to bppr in a timely manner and in a manner that meets bpprs requirements the core apis that evertec has committed to develop in order for bppr to connect future enhancements to the acquired assets to existing evertec core applications we may be exposed to heightened business risks as a result of the extension until of bpprs exclusivity with evertec in connection with its merchant acquiring business as well as the extension until of bpprs commitment with respect to the ath network in light of the pace of technology changes and competition in the payments industry and evertecs strategy and investments after the closing of the evertec transaction may be refocused away from popular towards other strategic initiatives any of the foregoing risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our earnings cash flows financial condition andor stock price
