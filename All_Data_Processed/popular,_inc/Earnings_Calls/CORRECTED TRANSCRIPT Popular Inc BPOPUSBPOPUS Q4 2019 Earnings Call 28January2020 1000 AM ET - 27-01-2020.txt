executive officer popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2020 good morning and thank you for joining the call todays results reflect another solid quarter and an outstanding year in which we achieved record core earnings before i discuss the highlights for im very pleased to report that in january we announced a series of planned capital actions that we intend to execute this year these actions include an increase in the companys quarterly common stock dividend from to per share beginning in the second quarter of and a common stock repurchase program of up to million we also announced the redemption of our series b preferred stock of which million is currently outstanding additionally on december we acquired a million credit card portfolio in puerto rico in a separate transaction we also acquired the rights to issue credit cards under the jetblue cobranded loyalty program in puerto rico and we plan to launch this new product in the second half of these actions evidence the strength of our capital position which allows us to return capital to our shareholders while we continue to invest in our franchise please turn to slide we reported core earnings for the full year our annual net income of million reflects an increase of from our adjusted net income of million results benefit from the strong deposit and loan growth in both puerto rico and the us credit quality metrics continue to be positive in in puerto rico most indicators were better than or close to prehurricane levels in the us credit quality was solid throughout the year and reduced our exposure to the taxi medallion market to million our capital levels are strong with yearend tier capital and tier common ratio at our tangible book value ended at a increase yearoveryear in puerto rico we grew loans by increased our deposits by and our net interest margin was in our us operation we grew loans and our deposits each by and our net interest margin was please turn to slide our reported core net income of million which included an million tax benefit was slightly higher than the previous quarter and million or higher than the adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fourth quarter results were driven by lower taxes and higher noninterest income partially offset by lower net interest income higher provision and higher expenses net interest income was lower compared to the previous quarter the fourth quarter was the first quarter to reflect the cumulative impact of the three recent interest rate cuts as such the lower yields in our loan and investment portfolios were only partially offset by increases in investment and money market balances credit quality results continue to show favorable trends the credit metrics of our bppr operations reflect a lower nonperforming loans lower npl inflows and stable net charge offs the increase in net chargeoffs in the us operations was related to the taxi medallion portfolio which has now been largely resolved please turn to slide for an update on the environment in puerto rico economic activity stabilized in after a posthurricane rebound in this occurred despite the macro and political uncertainty that persisted throughout the year and have continued into early with respect to migration trends the most recently released passenger data from the san juan airport reflects that the net number of people who left the island through september was approximately excluding which was substantially impacted by the inflow of people coming back to puerto rico following the hurricanes the data for reflects a favorable variance compared to the same periods in and popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2020 which averaged outflows of people we will need to see whether the recent seismic activity in the south will have an impact on this trend additionally the us census bureau recently estimated that as of july the population of puerto rico remained flat versus this compares favorable to the ph average annual decline in the population since employment trends remained stable throughout the year in december total employment which includes self employed individuals was down versus december the unemployment rate was in december which is consistent with levels seen early in ph salaried employment was flat yearoveryear with both private and public employment essentially unchanged compared to the same period last year the auto industry continue to perform well in new units were sold down compared to but up and versus and cement sales were down in when compared to though there was considerable surge in activity in early following the hurricanes sales were and higher than in and the dollar value of our customers debit and credit card transactions in the fourth quarter grew by compared to the third quarter and by versus the same period in our consumer loan origination trends in puerto rico have also remained solid especially in the auto and personal loan segments our mortgage originations while still at historically low levels were higher than the previous quarter driven primarily by higher home purchase activity on the commercial loan side balances increased sequentially we continue to expect that incremental lending opportunities will be tied to the performance of the local economy and ongoing recovery efforts populars customers in puerto rico grew by this quarter and have increased by since december as we have commented before the sustainability and pace of further progress in the puerto rico economy will be heavily dependent on the magnitude and timing of federal recovery funds flowing into the island the disbursement of the funds has been slower than many had hoped this delay is related to concerns regarding the appropriate oversight of the disbursements of federal funds recently hud authorized the use of billion of cdbgdr funds subject to strict oversight requirement in addition to the billion previously released while this is definitely positive recent controversy relating to the distribution of emergency supplies may increase concern over local oversight it is difficult to predict whether this ultimately will impact the amount and timing of recovery funds received however we continue to believe that these funds will be significant and have a positive impact on the economy i will now offer a brief update on matters related to the seismic events that have impacted the southwestern part of the island including a magnitude earthquake on january i want to emphasize that this event does not compare to the widespread destruction and damage caused by hurricane maria the damage is mainly concentrated in municipalities which with the exception of ponce are relatively small fortunately none of our employees suffered physical harm and our facilities are in sound condition unlike maria telecommunications were unaffected and power was restored within days we resumed operations on the day following the earthquake and have provided uninterrupted service since all but three of our branches in puerto rico are operating normally we are in constant communication with our employees and working closely with our customers to help them with their specific needs popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2020 while the impact on our operations is limited many of the residents in the south suffered significant damages to their homes public schools remain closed and the ensuing aftershocks have made it extremely difficult for people in the region to regain a sense of normalcy as we have done in the past we swiftly responded through our foundation which has close ties with nonprofit organization and communities in the south to bring immediate assistance to those affected areas a little more than two years ago puerto rico faced and managed through the impact of hurricane maria although the scale of these events is not comparable to maria we remain attentive to the impact it could have in certain sectors of the economy principally in the hospitality industry puerto ricans are once again demonstrating overwhelming solidarity and support and are facing this situation with the resolve to move forward we will continue working with them confident that puerto rico will once again demonstrate its spirit and ability to rebuild i will now turn the call over to carlos who will discuss the financial results in greater detail carlos j vázquez executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you ignacio good morning before we turn to fourth quarter results let me expand on populars full year performance our net interest income increased by yearoveryear to billion due to solid loan growth along with robust ph though lower net interest margin in our provision expense decreased by approximately to million on the back of improved credit trends excluding the fdic related benefit in noninterest income increased by approximately yearoveryear driven by improvement across most segments operating expenses increased in the year to billion higher personnel costs and professional fees were the primary drivers our capital position was robust and ended the year with tangible book value per share increasing by nearly per share to and common equity tier ratio improved by basis points yearoveryear to this improvement was achieved even after the repurchase of million of common stock and an increase in our common stock dividend as ignacio mentioned overall an outstanding year please turn to slide for fourth quarter results as usual additional information is provided in the appendix to the slide deck todays earnings press release details variances from the third quarter net interest income for the quarter was million down million from the third quarter the primary driver of this decline was a decrease in rates that occurred during the third and fourth quarters of which along with our asset mix led to a basis points contraction in nim this impact was somewhat offset by higher commercial loans in both puerto rico and in the us higher auto and personal loans at bppr and lower interest expense this result is consistent with our commentary last quarter that lower interest rates negatively impact our results by million to million per quarter for every basis point drop in rates other factors like asset mix and the shape of the yield curve also impact this estimate we expect our margin to improve from fourth quarter levels as a result of ph present expectations of stable rates a gradual reduction in our asset sensitivity and the eventual normalization of the levels of puerto rico government deposits these government deposit levels exceed our expectations that margin improvement could be less ph but our net income will benefit as of the end of the fourth quarter puerto rico public deposits were roughly billion which is down from the end of  but consistent with the balance as communicated in our last webcast popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2020 in our loan portfolio grew by million or despite a runoff of million in our legacy mortgage and westernbank portfolios in we anticipate slight growth in loan balances for popular in puerto rico we expect to see growth in most segments including commercial auto and personal loans despite continued runoff in our legacy mortgage and commercial portfolios in the us we anticipate commercial lending to be the primary driver of higher loan balances our provision in the fourth quarter increased by million sequentially lidio will expand on this during his credit commentary noninterest income increased by million in the period the improvement was due to a ph million increase in insurance fees driven primarily by higher contingent commissions which usually happened in  we benefited from a million improvement in mortgage banking results maybe due to msr valuation adjustment and finally a million variable variance in the adjustment to indemnity reserves on previously sold loans total operating expenses were million million higher than the prior quarter personnel cost increased by million in the quarter these increases were driven by annual incentives and head count higher commissions and incremental investments in employee benefits and training professional fees increased by million primarily due to higher expenditures in regulatory accounting and technology fees offset in part by lower legal fees business promotion costs were million higher in the fourth quarter reflecting the traditional seasonality of this expense line these increases were partially offset by lower other operating expenses by million mainly due to lower operating losses and the nonrecurrence of a million loss related to an undeveloped corporate site which was placed for sale during the third quarter profitsharing expenses were million in  and totaled million for the year if we exclude the profitsharing expense which by definition is not budgeted our average quarterly expense for the year was million consistent with our original guidance of million for we expect average quarterly expenses to be around million the increase from is mostly driven by higher expenses in the following categories personnel as we continue to invest in training and compensation with the related benefits also increasing a tight labor market in puerto rico are in the areas where we operate in the mainland contribute to this increase technology as weve continued to modernize our digital capabilities ph pure obsolescence and address regulatory cyber and compliance needs some of the increased results from the completion of multiyear technology investments that now start to be amortized and finally business promotion especially expenses related to rewards programs for our clients many linked to our revamped credit card offerings in puerto rico and growth in our digital channels part of this higher technology and rewards expenses are related to our expectation of higher levels of activity by our clients obviously we will strive to come in below this level of expenses if possible management objectives for reflect this goal our effective tax rates for the quarter was which includes a previously disclosed benefit of million related to revisions of the amounts of exempt income for the year to excluding these adjustments our effective tax rate would have been for we expect the effective tax rate to be within a range of to please turn to slide our capital levels remain strong relative to mainland peers as well with respect to well capitalized regulatory requirements as ignacio mentioned at the start of todays call our announced capital popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2020 plan includes three actions first an increase in populars quarterly common dividend by or to per share we expect to implement this increase for our next quarterly dividend in  secondly we will be implementing a common stock repurchase program of up to million while our recent buyback programs have been executed via asrs the detailed implementation plan for this buyback is still under consideration finally on friday we announced the redemption of the remaining outstanding balance of populars series b preferred stock as these securities represent high cost liabilities our common equity tier ratio was up from and tangible book value increased in the quarter by per share to the increase was driven by our quarterly net income partially offset by lower unrealized gains on investments and the impact of our common and preferred dividends our return on tangible equity was in the fourth quarter and in we will continue to pursue our target of maintaining and improving our doubledigit return of tangible equity please turn to slide we have continued our evaluation and implementation efforts for cecl based on our analysis we estimate that the allowance for loan and lease losses would increase by a range of million to million or to of the existing reserves this estimated increase slightly lower than last quarters is driven by the puerto rico mortgage credit card and auto loan portfolios based on this estimate the day one impact of the adoption of cecl would result in a decrease in tangible book value of approximately per share or since populars allowance already exceeds of loans the incremental allowance resulting from cecl will be excluded from total capital in accordance with present regulatory guidance we plan to phase in the day one effects of cecl on regulatory capital over a threeyear period as such we estimate the day one impact to result in a reduction of cet and total capital of approximately basis points after the adoption of cecl popular will continue to be well capitalized as part of the adoption of cecl the corporation has made the election to break the existing pools of purchased credit impaired or pci loans previously accounted for under sop under cecl these loans will be accounted for as individual loans instead of pools of loans up to now pci loans have been excluded from being reported as nonperforming due to the estimation of cash flows at the pool level upon transition to the individual loan measurement these loans will no longer be excluded from nonperforming status this change in accounting treatment would have resulted as of in an increase of million in reported npls this increase is composed of million in loans currently reported over days past due that are not npls and million in loans that are not delinquent in their payment terms but would be reported as nonperforming due to other credit quality considerations again these adjustments in reported npls would be as of december and could change by the time we report our results under cecl let me stress that this reporting change does not in any way alter or increase the credit risk containing populars loan portfolio however the accounting treatment of the loans will result in higher reported npl levels the corporation would pursue renegotiations resolutions and loan dispositions that may reduce this postcecl reported npls further we are still refining our simulations of the effects of the new cecl models under provision for so we are not in a position to provide additional insights on provision at this time with that i will turn the call over to lidio popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2020 lidio v soriano chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc thank you carlos and good morning the credit quality metrics for the corporation continue to show favorable trends in puerto rico our credit metrics reflected lower nonperforming loans lower npl inflows and stable net chargeoffs in the us we reached agreements with the majority of our taxi medallion borrowers resulting in an increase in net chargeoff excluding this impact credit quality metrics in the us remain favorable we continue to be attentive to the performance of our portfolios and related credit metrics in terms of our exposure to earthquake areas approximately of our mortgage and of our consumer loan portfolios pertain to areas declared as major disaster so far customer inquiries and requests for modifications have been limited in terms of our outstanding direct exposure to the puerto rico government municipalities and other instrumentalities at year end the balance was million a decrease of million when compared to last year please turn to slide number to review credit metrics at the end of the year nonperforming assets decreased by million to million this quarter driven by a nonperforming loans decrease of million offset in part by an oreo increase of million the decline in nonperforming loans was mainly driven by improvements in both puerto rico and the us in puerto rico npls decreased by million with a million reduction in commercial and a million reduction in mortgage the decrease in commercial was mostly the result of two commercial loan relationship while the decrease in mortgage was mostly due to the continued improvement in the portfolio these reductions were offset in part by higher consumer npls of million mostly related to auto loans following the reliable acquisition we have experienced an increase in yearly delinquency npls and net charge off in our auto loan portfolio mostly driven by the ph seasoning of the acquired portfolio and higher originations in lower fico segments while we are attentive to these trends we are not overly concerned as some deterioration was expected following the acquisition of a current portfolio and changes in the origination mix we remain pleased with the result of the acquisition in the us npls decreased by million mostly due to an npl construction loan sold during the quarter at the end of the year the ratio of npls to total loans heldinportfolio was compared to in the third quarter of the increase in oreo was mainly in the puerto rico mortgage portfolio please turn to slide number to discuss npl inflows the npl story is positive so ill be brief compared to the previous quarter inflows of npls excluding consumer loans decreased by million driven by improvements in the puerto rico commercial portfolio as the prior quarter included the impact of certain troubled debt restructured commercial real estate loans the improvement was offset in part by slight increase of million in the mortgage portfolio in the us inflows of npls were relatively flat quarteroverquarter turning to slide number net chargeoff amounted to million or annualized of average loans heldin portfolio compared to million or 97basispoint in the previous quarter the increase of million from the prior quarter was primarily related to net chargeoff toward taxi medallion portfolio of million reflecting agreements which with the majority of our taxi medallion borrowers at the end of the year net of reserves the current value of this portfolio was million or approximately of its unpaid principal balance of the remaining exposure is on the settlement agreements excluding the taxi popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2020 medallion impact the corporation net chargeoff will have improved by million or basis points net charge off in puerto rico were flat quarteroverquarter the corporations allowance for loan losses decreased by million from the prior quarter to million driven by a decrease of million in puerto rico coupled with a decrease of million in the us in puerto rico the decrease was mainly related to a decrease in the commercial qualitative reserves offset in part by an increase in reserves to the auto loan portfolio in the us the decrease in the allowance was driven by the previously mentioned chargeoff to the taxi medallion portfolio the provision for loan losses increased to million from million in the prior quarter with an increase of million in puerto rico an increase of million in the us to summarize credit quality metrics continue to show favorable trends for the fourth quarter in puerto rico results were better or stable on a quartertoquarter basis while in the us we reached settlement agreements with our taxi medallion borrowers impacting chargeoff excluding this results for the us were strong with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer popular inc thank you lidio and carlos for your update was an outstanding year for popular we achieved record financial results and accomplished important milestones the integration of our auto business the asset purchases in puerto rico and our recently announced planned capital actions reflect that strength we begin on a solid footing and excited about our prospects for the year our puerto rico franchise is unrivaled its consistently grown our retail and commercial customer base and now serves million customers however we do not take our leadership position for granted and we remain focused on enhancing our customers experience across all our channels our unmatched branch network is enhanced by our innovative digital solutions approximately of our clients are active online and of these clients use mobile devices to interact with us in december of our deposit transactions in puerto rico were processed through smart atms and mobile devices a figure that has been growing consistently the breadth and depth of our retail and commercial product offerings in puerto rico allow us to meet the evolving banking needs of our customers our operation in the mainland united states while more focused provides diversification to our footprint we have a strong commercial lending unit that is complemented by two specialized national lending businesses condo association banking and healthcare our investments at evertec and bhd león contribute to earnings and represent unrecognized value we are encouraged by our results and remain focused on enhancing shareholder value we are now ready to answer your questions popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions first question comes from alex twerdahl piper sandler please go ahead alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co first off just wanted to drill in a little bit more to cecl and i appreciate carlos your commentary on not being in a position to provide guidance on future provisioning at this time but just with the reserve now approaching and losses conceivably being incorporated already in that reserve is there really a scenario where that reserve does not start to come down in some sort of fashion as approaches or progresses lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc i think as we mentioned and mentioned by carlos we are not providing any guidance on it but i can two things that you are expected to affect the levels of allowance one is whether the portfolio grows or not so thats a factor and then the other is chargeoff we expect to have chargeoff and there might be slight growth in our portfolio so everything else being equal that should lead to a slight growth in the allowance alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co im sorry can you say that again you said that the allowance should grow lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc everything else being equal growth in the portfolio and chargeoffs should lead to additional growth in the allowance yes alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then switching gears to talk about loan growth a little bit saw some nice commercial loan growth this quarter was any of that tied to a specific posthurricane maria recovery money flowing to the island popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2020 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc this is ignacio its hard to tie in directly i mean some of the construction clients probably have some but i would say it was not directly tied to the recovery efforts again some of the lines for our clients to do work were increased and they used some of those lines but i would not attribute it primarily to that i would attribute it primarily just to general economic activity alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just a final question for me as we think about expenses for the million average does that include profit sharing or is that something that if you have a pretty good year would wind up increasing expenses again carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc no it does not include a profit sharing because obviously we have to be a whole set of targets to for the profit sharing to start coming in so it does not include any profitsharing efforts alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks for taking my questions carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you operator next question comes from gerard cassidy rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning everyone ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc good morning lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc good morning how are you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good carlos can you share with us if i recall in the past when youve returned the capital to shareholders through the stock repurchase programs you seem to been able to kind of do it in the beginning right after the approval in an accelerated fashion with this million that you were approved for this time around is it going popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2020 to be spread out more evenly over a 12month period or should we expect more of it to be upfront how are you guys thinking about that carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc its a good question were in the middle of consultations with all our esteemed investment banking coverage teams so we its not finally decided yet exactly how were going to do it gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then another question you guys seem to have some good success in engaging your customers in the digital transformation youve given us additional statistics can you give us an idea are half of your customers now in digital or twothirds or how much more do you have to go and then what kind of benefit from a cost standpoint do you possibly see in the horizon where maybe you need fewer branches or smaller branches et cetera ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc yeah i mean if you look at our total number of customers we cite them as million and so are active online which means that they transact at least once a month so more of them are online obviously we continue to work on digital we have found that in puerto rico our customers although theyre active online also appreciate the proximity in the branches we will continue to experiment on our branch size and how we can incorporate digital into the branches how we can use our smart atms and also we just opened up a branch in the mall of san juan which is sort of a digitally based branch where we dont take we dont process any deposits for any digital transactions lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc no tellers ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc no tellers so well continue to working on that what the branch looks like but again if youve ever been to our branches the number of transactions in our branches were still high the number of digital transactions have grown exponentially but the number of regular paper transactions have only decreased slightly so theres not a correlation between the exponential growth and the digital so well have to wait but were looking at this closely were experimenting if you come to san juan you ought to see that branch in the mall of san juan its really cool lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc thats one of the probably one of the interesting differences between our business in puerto rico and the business most of our peers in the mainland gerard as you know in the mainland mostly what banks have seen is a transfer of transactions out of the branch into the digital channel as ignacio mentioned our branch channel continues to be very very robust and its really not going down very much popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2020 but all the growth is happening on the digital channels so we are doing more transactions as our clients take digital but they do not stop going to the branches when they are digital channel clients and that might be slightly different than the mainland ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc yeah and interesting enough even when you ask customers one of the most important elements they look at when they pick a bank its still the branch network now one thing you got to keep in mind is that theres been tremendous consolidation in puerto rico in the last years and the number of branches in puerto rico as a whole has reduced dramatically and in puerto rico the number of branches for people is still well below the us gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good you guys obviously talked about the success of the wells fargo auto portfolio acquisition and the integration into your organization you mentioned this quarter youve purchased a credit card portfolio of million in receivables two questions one is are there potential for more portfolio like acquisitions that you see in maybe and then second is there any interest in building out the density of your new york or florida franchises with actual whole bank acquisitions ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc i think to the first point we i think we like to characterize ourselves opportunistic buyers so i dont think theres a lot of reliable auto transactions left in puerto rico but we keep finding and digging and other institutions are willing to sell we are opportunistic buyers so well keep looking in terms of the us probably i think were pretty comfortable with our footprint in the new york area indiscernible should be looking forward probably to grow in the south florida but again were opportunistic but were not going to do anything that doesnt make economic sense just for doing a transaction gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you very much operator operator instructions our next question comes from glen manna keefe bruyette woods please go ahead glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning guys ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc good morning popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2020 lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc good morning glen glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so last fridays announcement for the redemption of the series b was there anything else in your capital plan that had redemption of any other or straight preferred or the trust preferreds out there carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc no ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc no carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc no we are all the components of our capital plan are now perfect yeah glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah okay just a followup on alexs question with an all that looks like its around the range postcecl day one and maybe chargeoffs going down the basis points and loan growth i guess the way the street is kind of thinking about it assuming the portfolio mix doesnt change it would kind of indicate that the provision the streets provision for next year of around million to million is a reasonable methodology under those parameters would you kind of agree with that or not lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc yeah i mean weve heard glen weve heard a lot of people are approaching this different way probably the most common approach weve heard is the one you just described so that sounds reasonable unfortunately on the cecl the part that this approach cannot incorporate any way is any change in the input variables to the models so my answer is that yes it sounds reasonable but despite the fact that its reasonable it could end up not being accurate because again it is impossible for anybody to sort of be able to gauge the input variables into the models of each bank reporting so yeah it sounds like the right ballpark but doesnt mean its going to give you the right answer glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay fair enough and then just a couple of more on it looks like bpprs deposit beta on average fed funds moving was around last quarter and bpna was we probably have a little remaining deposit repricing would you expect the betas to stay in that range in each geography as we kind of get that like some period of deposit repricing after the rate cuts popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2020 lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc i mean our deposit beta the components of our deposit book are the ones you know well glen we have a public sector deposit book which is about of deposits in puerto rico that has the beta of close to one we have the rest of our book in puerto rico that has very low beta and the us book that is about half and half high beta or low beta if there is no change in mix which is always the catch here then the changes i think might be similar for this whole change in rates but it looks like rates are going to be flattish so i would expect our deposit cost to reflect the flattish rates more than anything else glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and the last one on the the cost of borrowing looks like it went up by basis points quarteroverquarter i know that its a threemonth libor which is down a bit but what are the dynamics there on the borrowing side lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc yeah its a small component glen indiscernible i can get back to you with an answer to that because i dont have it on the top of my head there isnt a lot of change underlying and we are speculating that it may just be that some parts of the line that were low cost fell off or matured andor something like that so youre left with a little bit of the more expensive stuff or we may have extended some pieces of that line again it is a small line that did not change much in magnitude but its a valid question ill owe you an answer though glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you have a great day guys lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc thanks ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc thanks operator this concludes our questionandanswer session id like to turn the conference back over to mr ignacio alvarez for any closing remarks please go ahead ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer popular
