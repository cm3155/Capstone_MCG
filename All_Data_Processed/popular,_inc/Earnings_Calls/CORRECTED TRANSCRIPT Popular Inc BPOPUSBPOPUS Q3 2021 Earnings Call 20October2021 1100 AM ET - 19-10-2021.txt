will remain attentive to how the evolving health situation may impact the economy i will now turn the call over to carlos for more detail on our financial results carlos j vázquez executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you ignacio good morning please turn to slide as usual additional information is provided in the appendix to the slide deck todays earnings press release detailed variances from the second quarter net interest income for the third quarter was million an increase of million from  noninterest income increased by million to million in  around million of the increase came from extraordinary items including a million gain associated with the sale and leaseback of two corporate buildings plus million higher net earnings from investments held under the equity method along with other smaller positive variances the provision for the second quarter was a benefit of million this was million higher than the benefit recorded in the second quarter lidio will expand on creditrelated matters total operating expenses were million in the quarter an increase of million from  this increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation cost by million mostly driven by annual merit increases higher professional fees by million a lower oreo gain by million plus smaller increases in other categories like fdic deposit cost and business promotion higher credit and debit card transactions also drove a million increase in related expenses for the fourth quarter we expect expenses to be between million and million this is consistent with our guidance for average quarterly expenses in to be between million and million obviously if popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 possible we will try to improve on this number our effective tax rate for the quarter was the same as last quarter in  we expect the effective tax rate to be between and please turn to slide nii on a taxable equivalent basis was million million lower than in the second quarter the primary driver for this decrease was lower investment portfolio interest income by million due to lower yields which was partially offset by million higher interest income from loans and lower deposit costs by million a lower mix of exempt income also contributed to this outcome deposits grew by billion in the quarter most of the growth was at bppr with a million increase in puerto rico government deposits and a million increase in our retail and commercial deposits net interest margin decreased by basis points to in  on a taxable equivalent basis nim was a decrease of basis points the lower margin was due to higher balances of lowyielding money market and investment securities total loan yields increased by basis points in  a result of higher ppp related income of million compared to million in the second quarter ppp loans yielded approximately compared to last quarter due to higher accelerated recognition of fee income upon forgiveness yeartodate we have recognized million in income from this program the remaining unamortized portion of fees for the ppp portfolio is approximately million of which we expect to recognize half in  and the remainder in the first half of as of the end of the third quarter puerto rico public deposits were roughly billion an increase of million from last quarter we continue to expect public deposit balances to come down over time driven by the restructuring of public sector debt and the return to current debt service our ending loan balances decreased by million in the quarter this decline was due to a ph million decrease in ppp loans and a million runoff in our residential mortgage portfolio excluding the impact of ppp loan balances grew by million driven by higher commercial auto loan and lease balances in puerto rico these increases were offset in part by lower commercial balances in the us driven by higher pre payments we do not expect overall loan growth to materialize until the middle of next year when demand resulting from expected economic growth should outpace the forgiveness of ppp loans please turn to slide our common equity tier1 ratio in  was an increase of basis points from  primarily due to net income on september the corporation completed the previously announced asr and in total we purchased approximately million shares at an average purchase price of additionally last month we announced the redemption of the million outstanding balance of our trust preferred securities to be executed in  which will result in reduced annual interest expense of million tangible book value increased by per share to this increase was primarily driven by our quarterly net income and partially offset by dividends and lower accumulated unrealized gains on investments our return on tangible equity was in the third quarter in summary during we have repurchased million in common stock increased our quarterly dividend by per share to per share redeemed million in high trust prefs and on october we acquired a national healthcare equipment leasing business for million in cash popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 we have also returned to our normal capital planning schedule which should result in an announcement of populars capital actions no later than january webcast with that ill turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano executive vice president and chief risk officer popular inc thank you carlos and good morning during the third quarter the corporation continued to exhibit strong credit quality metrics and low credit costs driven by the improving economic environment please turn to slide number to discuss credit metrics nonperforming assets decreased by million to million this quarter mainly driven by an npl decrease of million coupled with a decrease of million in non performing loans held for sale offset in part by an increase of million ph through other real estate owned in puerto rico npls decreased by million mainly due to lower commercial npls of million this was due to payments received and charges taken on collateral dependent loans coupled with lower mortgage npls of million resulting from lower inflows and continued improvement in the credit profile of the portfolio in the us npls decreased by million mostly related to a commercial loan payoff the million decrease in npls held for sale was mainly due to loan sales the ratio of npls to total loans held in portfolio was compared to in the prior quarter please turn to slide to discuss npl inflows compared to the second quarter npl inflows excluding consumer loan decreased by million driven by a decrease of million in puerto rico as the prior quarter included the inflow of a million commercial relationship coupled with a decrease of million in mortgage npl inflows in the us npl inflows decreased by million mainly due to lower commercial inflows turning to slide number net chargeoffs amounted to million or an annualized basis points of average loans held in portfolio compared to a net recovery of million or negative 2basis point in the previous quarter the quarteroverquarter comparison was impacted by the recovery in the prior quarter of a million commercial relationship in puerto rico excluding this the net chargeoff ratio would have been flat quarteroverquarter 12basis point versus basis points net chargeoffs continue to be significantly below prepandemic levels our allowance for credit losses decreased by million or to million driven mainly by improvements in the economic scenarios and credit quality as we will discuss in the following slide the ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans held in portfolio decreased to from in the prior quarter excluding ppp loans and guarantee mortgage loans this ratio is the ratio of allowance for credit losses to npls heldinportfolio was flat from the prior quarter please turn to slide number to discuss details on the drivers of the variance in allowance for credit losses as we previously mentioned the allowance for credit losses decreased by million when compared to the previous quarter variances were driven by changes to qualitative reserves and economic outlook as well as portfolio credit quality and mix while a strong recovery is evident we also consider more adverse outcomes given uncertainties around the impact of new virus strains and the puerto rico governments ability to utilize the available federal assistance popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 as a result we continue to assign the highest probability to the baseline scenario followed by the more pessimistic s3 scenario our macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables with the unemployment rate and gdp being the largest drivers the current baseline scenario expectations for gdp growth and the unemployment rate expectation are flat quarteroverquarter however moodys analytics revisions to certain incomerelated variables in puerto rico contributed to a million decrease in the allowance for credit losses during the quarter we released million from our qualitative reserve prompted by the economic environment and improvements in the outlook for the us ph cre portfolio total portfolio changes particularly in the puerto rico commercial and auto loan portfolio caused the acl to decrease by million portfolio changes includes fluctuations in credit quality volume and mix to summarize our loan portfolio exhibited improved credit quality metrics during the third quarter with net charge off activity significantly below prepandemic levels we will continue to monitor the exposure of the portfolios to pandemicrelated risks and changes in the economic outlook with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you lidio and carlos for your updates our results in to date have been strong driven by solid earnings improved credit quality record deposit levels continued customer growth and the successful execution of our capital actions we are optimistic about the economic outlook in addition to the unprecedented level of federal stimulus related to covid puerto rico still has a significant amount of hurricane recovery funds that have yet to be disbursed which we expect will now start flowing at a faster pace the combined impact to these factors and continued consumer spending should generate considerable economic activity in many sectors for the coming years and we are wellpositioned to benefit from such activity a successful resolution of the debt situation in puerto rico would also be a positive factor and last but certainly not least were looking forward to having the entire team together in our offices again given progress in the vaccination process a general improvement in health conditions in our markets and sound safety protocols in our facilities we have begun to bring back to the office our colleagues that were still working remotely the managers and supervisors returned earlier this month and the remainder of our workforce will return in early november we are entering the homestretch of despite all those challenges this has been a great year thus far with solid results and significant accomplishments our team is energized and committed to ending the year on a strong footing we are now ready to answer your questions popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions the first question comes from brock vandervliet of ubs brock your line is open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc oh thanks thanks very much i did manage to get in the queue if you could just start in terms of core loan growth expectations i understand overall loan growth is going to take a while to overcome the ppp paydown headwinds which you already outlined but how should we think about core loan growth over the next couple of quarters ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well this is ignacio i think we got to look at it a little bit sectorbysector over the next quarters i mean besides ppp we have a large mortgage loan book in the us which is paying down about carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc puerto rico yes ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc puerto rico so but i think we expect to see continued loan growth in auto and the commercial sector looks very strong also so those are sectors that we expect to see growth in the commercial we expect to see growth both in puerto rico and in the us in the us this quarter we had a lot of paydowns from the construction portfolio especially but i think youll see sectors like auto and commercial be coming up sooner overall we continue to say as i think carlos mentioned in his prepared remarks that overall when you look at the overall loan balance probably wont see a significant net growth until the second half of next year carlos you want to add something carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah yeah no brock i mean were pretty pleased that exppp both last quarter and this quarter our loans grew so our commentary on net growth is just the fact that in the fourth quarter its roughly half of our remaining ppp portfolio thats forgiven and we have similar runoff in our ph resi portfolio about billion of loan so we started minus million already and in the first half of next year if the other half of our ppp portfolio is forgiven which we expect and then mortgage runoff doesnt change then we start at minus million for the first half of next year so that is what leads the math but in general were pretty happy that exppp both last quarter and this quarter we had net loan growth popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and just separately on capital i noticed you bought the leasing business not a terribly large acquisition but certainly material given that purchase price youre continuing to build capital reserves look ample given the credit contours how should we think about capital allocation carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc i mean we keep trying to touch all the buttons or pull all the levers whichever way you want to address or think about it this year i think we have successfully done so we saw all the different ways in which we can manage capital that have been put to use and that will hopefully continue to be the way we operate in the future were in the middle of our capital plans for now again we are hopeful that well have an announcement by the webcast in in january but in general given our levels of capital we will probably have to continue to pull all the levers to achieve what we want to do which is over time to move our capital levels in the direction of our us peers plus some cushion brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks ill jump back in the queue carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you brock operator our next question comes from alex twerdahl of piper sandler alex your line is open alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc hello carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co can you hear me yeah popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah okay alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co yes sorry about that wanted to just start off a little bit more on this k2 acquisition initially it seems like kind of small potatoes in terms of the net assets being acquired but just looking at the purchase price certainly leads me to the suspicion that maybe this is actually a pretty good loangenerating engine and i was hoping that you could expand a little bit more on sort of what kind of origination capabilities this platform has and how its going to sort of fit into the overall model ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well i dont have the numbers exactly in the projection of originations but i can tell you that its when we look in the states weve said before were looking for niche businesses that can complement our existing businesses and this is a healthcare equipment leasing company which we think really fits well and strategically complements our national healthcare lending business so we think that we like the people behind k2 we think they have a good business but we think that the synergies that we can create with healthcare business are important and we hope to try to make into a national platform the same way weve done with ph pab in our healthcare vertical alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co can you talk a little bit more on sort of what type of loans these are and what kind of yields that we expect to replace the cash with ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah the loans are basically mostly finance leases of medical equipment like machines that you put in healthcare centers so just generally healthcare xray machines or other types of whats that carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc mri ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc mris lets say im dating myself when i say mri that kind of thing i dont have indiscernible carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah i dont have the number on the yield either alex but i mean if when all the acquisition noise comes out and everything normalizes call it in we expect it to contribute about highsingledigit millions to net income every year and hopefully grow as ignacio said one part of the beauty of this is that not only does it add an popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 important product for healthcare clients it also makes our existing healthcare offering more competitive so part of the benefit of this acquisition will not be in the subsidiary itself it will actually be part of popular bank alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just in terms of the sort of when you do a deal like this and the regulatory process this one is relatively small but i imagine it does play a role in sort of the sort of overall capital allocation from a regulatory standpoint do you have to go through the same process as you do with the buyback and the dividend carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah the regulatory system is quite complex lets not call it indiscernible but its quite complex so depending how you do an acquisition it depends how you have to go through different regulatory structures this case since were doing it through a subsidiary of popular bank in fact we only have to go to the new york dfs so it was a relatively simple straightforward process i dont think it would be material enough for example the fed when were looking at our capital plan obviously they look at everything we do but i dont think its going to move the needle one way or the other in the capital plan alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just another question on the bankruptcy you sort of alluded to the end being kind of within sight its a little bit hard i think sometimes for a lot of investors and for me to kind of boil through some of the headlines but it seems like theyre getting pretty close to a deal between the board and the bondholders and it seems like the government may have gotten what they wanted with the pension scheme can you just help us understand exactly where we are in that process ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah well were actually in a critical stage as youre uptodate so there was negotiations going back and forth and both the executive branch and the legislative branch had basically said that they werent going to sign off on any deal that had cuts to the existing pension and there was also controversy regarding the amounts that will be budgeted to support the public university the upr they went back and forth in a couple of rounds and there appears to be an agreement in principle regarding that the indiscernible would present a plan of adjustment with zero cuts to the pension and with at least million for the upr yesterday the house of representatives voted on legislation to support that plan of adjustment one of the technical issues is that the plan of adjustment contemplated exchange of new bonds for existing bonds and theres a debate whether that has to go through the legislature or not so yesterday the house approved it they are still a bit short in the senate apparently some of the senators are not convinced that the language regarding no pension cuts is ironclad so i think the senate is scheduled to take this up on thursday again but youre right were very close the house did pass the enabling legislation and now were waiting on the senate the governor has said he will sign the legislation so really it requires the senate to approve it the senate is a very difficult situation in puerto rico because no party has an absolute majority the party has the president of the senate has a plurality but they dont have it so it requires more horse trading than usual popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 and so were really down to the ninth hour whether this gets approved by the senate it could happen as early as thursday if that doesnt happen then we have to go back and renegotiate something im hopeful itll happen on thursday but well have to wait and see alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co so if that does happen on thursday then the presumption is that the bankruptcy youll be able to exit bankruptcy at some point by the end of this year and then just remind us how much of public deposits i think in the past you said somewhere around billion to billion that sits on populars balance sheet would flow out directly related to that bankruptcy is that correct ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah thats our best estimate of course the government has not told us exactly we hold most of the public funds but there are other financial institutions that have public funds including local institution including city so but thats our best estimate yes and the process would be if this enabling legislation is passed the plan of adjustment will be considered by the court and its up to the court to approve or disapprove the plan of adjustment theoretically they could disapprove it we i dont think that given all the work thats gone through this i think thats not a likely result so hopefully we will have something by the end of the year in which case im not clear how soon the money will go out but it will go out relatively soon thereafter because its a cash down payment so alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and in terms of the financial impact to you guys if im remembering correctly its not i think the language is not material to nii but certainly would help the nim tce and roa is that correct carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc that is correct in the existing level of interest rate environment it is not material to nii and it would yeah it will obviously be very significant to our margin our margin has basically been driven by this sole factor for the last four or five quarters so our margin will return to be more linked to our core business than it has been for the last year plus alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co thank you for taking my questions carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 operator operator instructions our next question comes from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning ignacio and carlos ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc maybe this question we can start off with lidio if hes still there on credit obviously net chargeoffs for you folks were very low in the quarter and granted they were up slightly from the positive number that you had in the prior quarter but in the industry its experiencing incredibly low net chargeoffs in at this part of the cycle can you give us an what you think may happen in terms of how long can these low levels remain and do we start to see some sort of normalization in net chargeoffs by the end of next year into which still will be lower than a bad period but i would think that they eventually have to start creeping up lidio v soriano a executive vice president and chief risk officer popular inc ill give you my perspective i mean prior to the pandemic if you look over sort of three fiveyear periods the chargeoffs for popular were between corridor between 75basis point to 125basis point since the pandemic we have been significantly as you mentioned lower than that including a net benefit in the prior quarter when you look at npl formation when you look at early delinquency so just at least for the shortterm that will continue to be the case and i think a lot of it is going to be dependent upon economic performance and the pace of the ph federal system that carlos and ignacio alluded to in the prepared remarks but we expect to come to puerto rico so if that were to happen and we continue to see the level of economic activity that might last a little bit but i agree with you also that at some point in time things will normalize in the future gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good ignacio and carlos obviously you announced this acquisition recently and youre putting your cash to work and youve done other deals similar like the wells fargo automobile portfolio in their business a couple of years back i guess are there any other opportunities for you folks to put your excess capital to work in acquisitions whether its a nondepository or even a depository somewhere in the mainland ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 yeah we have traditionally been opportunistic buyers of assets and we continue to be so and so people bring opportunities to us and we review them this k2 seemed like a very nice fit to bolton it complements our healthcare vertical which is doing very well and we think has great potential for the future given the demographics of the country right so we will continue to look for those kinds of unique opportunity just like reliable we like the auto sector and it was there and it came across i have said before that especially bank acquisition is not our focus in the near future but we are opportunistic that when things present themselves we look at especially acquisitions of things that complement our existing businesses so i think our overall strategy hasnt changed k2 came around we looked at it carefully we thought it fit perfectly with our existing strategy so we executed gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just as a followup i know you need to keep a certain amount of cash on the balance sheet when the government finally draws down those excess deposits from your organization but carlos when you look out when do you think you may want to start to lengthen the duration of maybe some of those cash assets into longerterm securities carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc well given that rates are finally seem to be going up in time investment returns seem to starting to go up we are looking at that more closely now again as you know gerard i have it pains me significantly to extend duration to to years to get a yield of ph or something like that now were in the ph so its becoming more interesting so this is the job of our alco committee we look at this every week we did extend we did increase our investment portfolio by about billion this quarter so we do it selectively when we think theres good opportunities to extend again as rates move up our willingness to extend will move up accordingly so are we rushing through the door no are we taking a good look at the door right now yes we are gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just and i apologize i should know this but do you have a swaps book or and if you do is it growing are you looking to add to it some of your peers are doing that now in this period of their outlook for rates carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc no we dont have a swaps book gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay very good okay thank you carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 thank you operator we have a followup question from brock vandervliet of ubs brock your line is open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thank you its just going back to some of the credit questions i think everyone kind of focuses on chargeoffs and the reserve level but as we look at npls and theyve been down consistently and they were down substantially in puerto rico million this quarter why couldnt that drop far more meaningfully or are there sort of structural npls that we shouldnt expect to see go away it just seems like with the economic trajectory the structurally high level of problem assets that weve seen for years because puerto rico is in a recession should drop pretty hard ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc paul do you want to take that paul j cardillo a investor relations officer popular inc sure i can try when you look at npls in puerto rico and the mix of npls over time is mostly mortgagerelated npls that takes a little bit longer to resolve than maybe some other type of npls so that leads you to what you maybe call structural npls i mean thats going to take a longer time for it to work throughout and more so over the last since the pandemic because there have been lack of foreclosures and npls mortgage npls have actually not decreased as fast as other type of npls in the cycle in this part of the cycle so i think that is what is driving the many higher levels of npls that you see in puerto rico brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and just on expenses a number of the major banks have called out and its not unique to banks and just greater expense pressure difficulty in hiring that general theme is that something we should also be aware of within your business ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes i mean were not immune to the situation the hiring situation has become much more difficult there are salary pressures in puerto rico we still have an advantage against some of our main peers but we are seeing salary inflation in puerto rico as you get competition from all kinds of sectors so thats something that we can anticipate we will continue we made some salary increases at july as youve seen were going to be reviewing our minimum wage like everyone else is so these are this is a we have somewhat of a beneficial position in puerto rico but were subject to the same trends were subject to the same trends brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc understood okay thank you for the followups popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 operator we have no further questions in the queue so ill turn the call back to ignacio alvarez for closing remarks ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc again thank you everybody for joining i apologize for the inconvenience at the beginning of the call and we look forward to updating all
