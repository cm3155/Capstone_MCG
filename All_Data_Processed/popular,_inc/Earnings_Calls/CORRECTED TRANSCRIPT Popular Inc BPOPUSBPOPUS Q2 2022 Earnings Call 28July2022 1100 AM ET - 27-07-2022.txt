healthy during the period at both banco popular and popular bank our margin in puerto rico improved in the second quarter but continues to be impacted by our asset mix we are positioned to benefit

on the current macro environment in puerto rico the local economy continued to perform well during the second quarter as business activity and customer spending remained strong the puerto rico economic activity index which includes total employment cement sales electricity generation and gasoline sales has been steadily improving and has exceeded prepandemic levels for the last seven months we may encouraged by the strong employment levels in the second quarter total amount of unemployment in puerto rico reached its highest level in a decade the june unemployment rate of is the lowest

future i will now turn the call over to carlos for more details on our financial results carlos j vázquez executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you ignacio good morning please turn to slide as usual additional information is provided in the appendix of the slide deck todays earnings press release details variances from the first quarter net interest income for the second quarter was million an increase of million from  the variance was driven by higher yield on investment securities as well as higher income from loan growth at both banks this was somewhat offset by lower bppr related income and slightly higher interest expense on deposits noninterest income increased by million to million other service fees increased due to higher credit and debt interchange and fees resulting from growth in purchasing activity during  this was partially offset by lower income from investments held under the equity method by million we expect that the average level of quarterly noninterest income will remain at around million to million for the rest of the provision for credit losses for the second quarter was an expense of million compared to a benefit of million in the first quarter total operating expenses were million in the quarter an increase of million from  the increase was driven primarily by three factors higher professional fees by million due to higher processing and service charges credit and debit card processing expenses were up by million due to increased customer activity and personnel costs were million higher driven mostly by profit sharing plan accruals these expense increases were partially offset by a million decrease in other operating expenses primarily due to lower legal reserves and lower oreo expenses by million due to gains on the sale of oreo properties for the remaining two quarters of this year we now expect expenses to average million per quarter this brings the total average quarterly expenses for to million up from the previous guidance of million the increase is driven by the following first given our results yeartodate we anticipate a full year net income will exceed the threshold required to trigger employee profit sharing as such we are not including the anticipated expense for the year into our outlook second during the quarter we undertook a broadbased market review of employee compensation to ensure that we remain competitive the outcome of this process led to higher employee salaries across the corporation which will increase our personal expense run rate starting in the second half of this year popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 third the evolution of market regulatory expectations as well as increased customer activity will require us to continue to increase expenditures in certain areas such as compliance fraud and cybersecurity and finally given the pace of change in the financial services sector we will incur additional expenses as we invest in our digital offerings and launch other early stage initiatives to enhance our customer experience our effective tax rate for the quarter was compared to in the first quarter this increases primarily due to higher mix of taxable income for the full year we expect the effective tax rate to be between and this range includes the impact of marktomarket accounting on evertec holdings resulting from the expected reduction in our boarding interest in evertec the gains resulting from marktomarket are taxed our preferential rate please turn to slide net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was million million higher than the first quarter net interest margin increased by basis points to in  on a taxable equivalent basis nim was and increased to bps the improved net interest margin is driven by the higher interest rate environment and by improved asset mix specifically a lower proportion of money market investments and the increase in higher yielding loans higher yields on money market and investment portfolio by basis points and an increase in loan yield by basis points to ppp income in  was million down from million in the prior quarter due to lower recognition of fees upon loan forgiveness and lower balances the yield on portfolio was compared to in  the outstanding quarter end balance of ppp loans was million the remaining unamortized portion of fees for this portfolio is million most of which we expect to recognize during the third quarter excluding puerto rico public deposits deposit balances grew by million in the quarter as of the end of the second quarter public deposits were roughly billion an increase of billion from  at this time we continue to expect that public deposits will return to a rate of billion to billion by yearend while we remain assetsensitive disposition has been reduced significantly by our deployment of cash balances initially to the bond portfolio and more recently to fund loan growth given the rapid shift to higher shortterm rates moving forward we expect the cost of public sector deposits to start moving in tandem with market rates albeit with a lag as a result of these factors these basis point change in fed funds rate now corresponds to an increase of approximately million in nii per quarter we expect our interest rate sensitivity to become relatively neutral to higher rate scenarios in the coming quarters our ending loan balances increased by million or compared to  and are up by billion or year todate the quarterly increase occurred despite a decrease of million in ppp loans all segments except for mortgage in puerto rico were higher with commercial loan growth being particularly strong we are encouraged by the demand for credit at bppr and at pb we will continue to take advantage of opportunities to extend credit to improve the use and yield of our existing liquidity please turn to slide our return on tangible equity was in the quarter capital levels remain strong our common equity tier ratio in  was roughly unchanged from  on july the corporation completed a previously pls million asr in total we repurchased approximately million shares at an average purchase price of per share tangible book value at quarter end was per share an decrease driven mostly by higher accumulated unrealized losses on debt securities available for sale of million a result of rising interest rates this was partially offset by net income in the quarter the decrease in fair value of the investment portfolio should be temporary our investment popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 portfolio is nearly entirely comprised of treasury and agency mortgagebacked securities which carry minimal credit risk the bond portfolio has a duration of approximately four years as the positions grow down the yield curve their fair value will converge to par and they mark down to zero during the quarter new purchases of debt securities in the investment portfolio were categorized as heldtomaturity the lower marktomarket valuation of our investment portfolio does not have an impact on our regulatory capital ratios on july we completed a previously announced agreement with evertec to acquire key customer facing channels and to extend important commercial agreements as consideration for the transaction bppr delivered to evertec approximately million shares of evertec common stock valued at the closing of million this resulted in after tax gain of approximately million in terms of capital the transaction resulted in a negative impact to tangible book value of approximately million due to the net effect of the after tax gain of the evertec shares used as consideration for the transaction minus approximately million in goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in connection with the transaction and finally the effect of purchase accounting related adjustments as a result of the transfer of the shares used as consideration populars ownership in evertec was reduced from approximately to approximately at closing popular has agreed to further reduce its voting interest in evertec to no more than whether through selling shares of evertec common stock or a conversion of such shares into nonvoting stock by the end of the third quarter we expect to sell down the stake in evertec to no more than depending on market conditions subject to receipt of regulatory approvals we intend to plan to return to shareholders via common stock repurchases any aftertax gains resulting from such sale we also intend to complete the remaining million worth of buybacks under our capital plan by year end our normal capital planning scheduled to result in an announcement of populars capital actions no later than our january webcast well continue to explore opportunities to manage our capital structure during the remainder of and in future periods with that ill turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc thank you carlos and good morning overall popular continue to experience strong credit quality trends and low credit costs with low levels of net charge offs and decreasing nonperforming loans we continue to closely monitor changes in borrower performance and the macroeconomic environment given potential economic headwinds rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty however we believe that the improvement over the last few years in the risk profile of the corporations loan portfolios positions popular to operate successfully under more difficult economic conditions turning to slide number nonperforming assets decreased by million to million this quarter mainly driven by npl decrease of million the decreasing npls was mainly in puerto rico this was driven by lower mortgage npls of million primarily due to the combined effects of collection efforts increased foreclosure activity and the ongoing low levels of early delinquency compared with prepandemic trends coupled with lower commercial npls of million primarily due to the return to accrual status of million commercial relationships popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 in the us npls remain flat quarteroverquarter compared to the first quarter inflows to npl excluding consumer loans decreased by million in puerto rico total inflows decreased by million driven by lower commercial inflows of million and lower mortgage inflows of million in the us inflows remained flat quarteroverquarter the million order increase in the quarter was driven by the resumption of foreclosure activity in the puerto rico mortgage portfolio at the end of the quarter the ratio of npls to total loans heldinportfolio was compared to in the previous quarter turning to slide number net charge offs amounted to million or annualized basis points of average loans heldinportfolio compared to million or basis points in the prior quarter in puerto rico net chargeoffs were million flat quarteroverquarter in the us net chargeoffs reflected a negative variance of million as the prior quarter was of million compared to an expense of this quarter the corporation allowance for credit losses increased by million to million the increase was mainly in puerto rico driven by portfolio growth and changes to macroeconomic scenarios in the us ratio was flat quarteroverquarter the ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans heldinportfolio decreased by basis point to the ratio of allowance for credit losses to npls heldinportfolio was compared to in the prior quarter the provision for credit losses was an expense of million compared to a benefit of million in the previous quarter in puerto rico the provision for credit losses was an expense of million compared to a benefit of million while in the us the provision was an expense of million compared to a benefit of million please turn to slide number as discussed in prior webcasts we leverage moodys analytics for us and puerto rico economic forecasts moodys baseline forecasts expects growth to continue in and with some slowing occurring as the economy reaches full employment monetary policy becomes tighter covid19 fiscal stimulus ends and the russia war in ukraine affects energy and food prices however moodys analytics puts the odds of the economy that the company will suffer a downturn beginning in the next months at one in three with near even ups of a recession in the next months as a result we continue to assign the highest probability to the baseline scenario followed closely by the more pessimistic s3 scenario to summarize our loan portfolio continue to see strong credit quality trends in the second quarter with low net charge offs and decreasing nonperforming loans we continue to closely monitor changes in borrower performance under the macroeconomic environment however we believe that improvements over time and the risk profile of the corporation loans portfolios positions popular to operate successfully under more difficult economic environments with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks thank you ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you lidio and carlos for your updates our results for the first half of were strong driven by solid earnings robust loan growth improved credit quality and continued customer growth our capital liquidity position provides us the flexibility to invest for growth we continue returning capital to our shareholders despite the possible negative impacts of inflation higher interest rates and the war in ukraine we are still seeing growth in the us and puerto rico with a historically strong employment market and healthy consumer deposit and spending levels popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 in the case of puerto rico in addition to the unprecedented level of federal stimulus related to covid there is still a significant amount of hurricane recovery funds that are yet to be disbursed we expect that the combined impact of these factors will generate considerable economic activity in many sector for the coming years and we are wellpositioned to benefit from such activity in june we released our corporate sustainability report which is available on our website we have continued to further our esg efforts with a focus on promoting sustainable finance supporting our communities and fostering a strong culture of diversity equity and inclusion we are mindful of the responsibility we have to puerto rico as the leading banking institution and to all the communities that we serve i am thankful to our entire team who have continued to perform at a high level and deliver results

priority for us to invest in their continued growth and success we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver results to our shareholders at the same time as we invest in our people business and communities we are now ready to answer your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions the first question comes from brett rabatin with hovde group please go ahead brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning everyone ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning brett carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning brett brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc congratulations on doubledigit loan growth i didnt think id be saying that but the puerto rican environment but obviously strong growth and the economy continues to move along i wanted to make sure i understood what the outlook was in the back half of the year for loan growth i know that yearoveryear auto sales were down in june but they continue to be pretty robust and the commercial activity was notable this quarter maybe carlos any thoughts on or ignacio any thoughts on back half loan growth from here ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc the commercial loan growth we said it before is kind of lumpy so its hard for us to predict that but i can definitely say that we continue to see strong interest from our clients in the commercial sector regarding demand popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 for loans so we dont see any decrease in that as you saw the consumer balances increase across both lines also so were not seeing any negative impact there theres a lot of i like to point out that although theyre down for the previous year the local dealer association is still predicting new auto sales of vehicles for the year which is a very high number for puerto rico and we had and june was our highest month of originations in history for our auto and lease financing so we continue to see strong demand for auto in puerto rico obviously the supply chain issue is an issue here as it is in many places in the states but we still see a very healthy market brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats helpful color and then wanted to make sure i understood the decline in the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet it seem would seem to me like the margin and appreciate the million guidance for basis points but it would seem to me like the margin would continue to move upward im not sure if i fully understand how its becoming and the balance sheet is becoming neutral in terms of interest rate sensitivity and i was hoping maybe you could give us some color on deposit basis from here and whats making the balance sheet more neutral carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc well a couple of things are affecting it one were putting a lot of the immediately repricing assets to work right were extending some of our cash into the investment portfolio and more importantly were now also extending the cash into the loan portfolio which is what we prefer to do so with that well naturally reduce our asset sensitivity the other factor that affects this is as i mentioned as you know government deposits in puerto rico which is a big chunk of our deposit book is marketlinked but its not necessarily market linked instantaneously it is marketlinked with their lag so we have not seen that market linkage evident yet this early in our course of the process but it will become more evident in the next three months or so in the next four months to the point where they will become fully marketlinked meaning that we will have a live used up the lag in repricing at some point in time and that will reprice or move to repricing a big chunk of our deposit book on a marketlinked basis we will continue to be able to earn a nice margin on those deposits so they will still be accretive but that margin will not continue to increase as it may increase for deposits that are not linked to market so i think thats probably the other two the two biggest drivers brett brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats helpful carlos and then just lastly if i heard it right million of expense quarterly guidance in the back half of the year was curious how much of that might be the stockbased incentive compensation versus other pieces carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc sure let me walk for you through that as we have quarterly expenses of million our quarterly expenses tend to be seasonal so they usually tend to be lower in the second first two quarters of the year and higher in the second two quarters of the year so and thats what happened this quarter were running lower than our guidance of million which means by definition that the last two quarters of the year were going to be higher popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 anyway for us to hit that million so that is somewhat whats happening is just the normal seasonality in our expenses the change here is with the first thing you mentioned that we now believe given our performance yeartodate that the profit sharing payment will be triggered so we have added that to our outlook that is normally not part of our outlook because we dont assume profit sharing will be triggered we have to actually perform for that to happen and that will add something that looks like million to the outlook and the other piece of that that addresses the increase is where ignacio mentioned and i mentioned of the review of compensation of popular that weve done a very comprehensive review of compensation that ended up increasing compensation expenses for something that looks like in the ballpark of million a quarter or something like that that will be fully effective starting on this quarter and the third quarter of the year and moving forward and the combination of those two things are what explains the delta between this million and the new average part of the expenses of million so the average quarterly expenses are going up by million but the nominal expenses in the last two quarters will be up by a higher number but its just math obviously they weve gone up anyway even if those two these last two events i mentioned has not happened brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay great thats good color i appreciate it carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you operator thank you brett the next question comes from timur braziler with wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe just following up on the expense line of questioning the backend includes the evertec transaction and i guess what does that in and of itself due to the expenses carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 yes it does i think hold on for a second im getting my numbers here yeah it does include the evertec transaction and the effect of that is ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc reduction carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc and that reduction of standing expenses already including our outlook timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc no reduction to million okay and then you had made a comment that a component of the increased spend was to fund compliance fraud cybersecurity type initiatives is there any anything specific that kind of drove that narrative or is that just the cost of doing business and economic activity continues to ramp higher you need to ramp those initiatives of to kind of keep pace carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc your explanations were as good as mine were going to be yes it is the cost of doing business i mean the regulatory environment as you know is not getting any more complacent or any more flexible number one and number two we simply have more clients doing more transactions with us which means that its going to be more events its going to be more alerts its going to be more fraud alerts that need to be investigated its going to be more chances of more clients that cybercriminals can try to use their credentials to get into our systems so the growth of the business is the other part thats driving it so your explanation was on point timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just lastly on expenses what does that assume as far as oreo outlook carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc no it assumes oreo is at breakeven timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc oreo is breakeven okay great and then just on the remaining evertec transactions the sell down to that gain thats going to be returned to shareholders is that a event is that happened in the fourth quarter or does that need to go through the same type of capital plan and that should be included kind of incremental in the plan carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc no i mean it depends i mean well make the decision whether we want to go or not go depending on whats happening with the market first of all and that is the first part of what has to happen which is for us to actually popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 sell the shares once we have sold the shares then we need regulatory approval to actually do the additional redeploy those gains as a buyback and the regulatory approval takes the time that it takes i think there is and whether all that can happen in this quarter i dont know its probably unlikely so more than not it looks like something thats probably more of a fourth quarter event timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just lastly just following up on the government deposit is it lag that you referenced is that a lag on hikes or just a lag on timing when those hikes are passed along to the customer and maybe if you could just talk through kind of how long that lag is and any kind of color you can provide on the beta that youre expecting there carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah i mean its just the way the formula works and how we reflect market rates on the rate that applies to the customers so again there again your comment was correct and it applies over time and the lag is something that looks like three months or something in that ballpark indiscernible it also gradually will average into a through a period of about three months timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and do you have the exit deposit costs at the end of june do you have that deposit rate ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc the what the deposit cost timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc the cost of deposits at the end of june ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc we have it but we dont disclose it timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i tried ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc you mean public deposits are timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc no just total deposit costs at the end of june popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah total deposit costs we have it give me a second carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc we have for the quarter ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah we have for the quarter give me a second i think it was basis points give me a second i think its basis points timur total deposit cost for the quarter give me a second actually i have it for bppr and pb separately i dont have the popular bank bppr is it was basis points and the popular bank was basis points and so the number for popular bank is timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay okay thank you ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you operator thanks for your questions the next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi ignacio hi carlos ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc hello gerard carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc hello gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys share with us is obviously a number of crosscurrents going on in the economy today as we saw with the real gdp trend this morning and one of the concerns or one of the topics of conversation is end of cycle loan growth and the industry like you folks as well so good loan growth this quarter can you somehow give us some color or reassurances that a year from now were not going to be looking back and seeing maybe some popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 regrets that the loan growth was too strong in early part of when the evidence again crosscurrents and the economy is starting to show maybe a slowdown ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well yeah i think we feel very confident that we as opposed perhaps other people we have never really relaxed our credit standards so really the growth they were coming from where being continuing to be i think very prudent and very disciplined its just the economy especially here in puerto rico is strong and were starting to see economic activity which we havent seen for a long time and a lot of pentup demand but we really never relax our underwriting standards to try and create that loan growth sort of artificially so we feel were very well positioned as lidio has mentioned various times the industries were in we think our industries that will withstand some deceleration of growth as well our fico scores in the consumer book are strong so again were looking out for these is tailwinds that everyone knows and possibly out there but im not very concerned i mean we have not done anything that would lead us to believe we were unduly relaxed and now we have to attack and i think weve been very consistent and the longer we see it just a reflection of the pentup demand and economic growth especially in puerto rico carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc the other thing to consider with your question gerard is is the concept of end of cycle there is a number of very well respected local economies here in puerto rico that believe that the idiosyncratic things are effecting puerto rico economy which this time tend to be in our favor actually versus the last years that were against us meaning that of the effect of all the federal saw an expansion but also the fact that we have the extra lever of hurricane assistance that the rest of the country doesnt have that differential could mean that puerto rico may perform slightly better than the national average moving forward so some of the local economists believe that theres a reasonable chance that even if the us goes into recession as long as that recession is short and shallow that it may just be that puerto rico never gets into recession because of the positive effects of that investment so well have to see of course it depends on if there is a recession in the us and how long and how deep it is but there is a perception that we may perform slightly better in the island and that is we havent been able to say that for about years years now so hopefully we work on the chance that we actually have a possibility of performing slightly better than the us economy for once gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup to that are you seeing any new entrants into the market for lending mainly in banks that may be coming in that werent there months ago ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc not really i think we have seen some of the bigger banks that jpmorgans of the world and the goldman sachs being interested in some of these big transactions that they are hopeful will happen sort of like perhaps the privatization of the boards which is ongoing and things like that i havent seen any new activity of us players some of the local players like when banesco got a lot of money from that statute that benefited minority institutions which theyll be a little bit more aggressive in the small and medium size but theyre very small popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 institution but not really i mean theyve always been adherent in certain deals but nothing unusual other than i do think youre seeing more of the people that do project finance being interested in puerto rico carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc keep in mind that for large commercial transactions gerard we have always competed with mainland banks and mainland pension funds and mainland hedge funds for fund to fund them so its actually its not a lot of delta from how weve done business all the time any transaction that is significant large or is or the underlying client is a usbased client we have to compete with us banks for them anyway gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you and then just finally with the acquisition back a few years ago with the wells auto portfolio youre obviously a bigger auto lender on the island can you tell us what percentage of the auto loans are for used cars versus new cars and if you break that out ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc one more we have a couple of more carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc ph you mentioned someone said that its about half and half half used and unused lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc in the nation but in the portfolio carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc i dont think we have the portfolio number right now gerard but we can get that ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc but it is an important market in puerto rico carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yes we can get gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc that moving on gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and are you in puerto rico seeing the used car price inflation similar to what weve seen in the states which may if the new car market comes back in two years used car prices could be lower two years from now than today you guys seen that elevation in okay ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes im not sure gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc what weve seen but definitely clarify used car prices have gone up in puerto rico so obviously were maintaining our discipline regarding again i said our underwriting standards we are not were very happy with the originations were getting with our existing underwriting standards so we havent found a necessity to lower that keep in mind that one of the things that is a bit of an offset in puerto rico that were very we have very high taxes on cars especially new cars so that helps a little bit the used car because when you go buy a new car you have to pay a very high we call indiscernible tax and therefore used car market still has a little bit of a cushion in that sense in puerto rico but were watching it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator thank you for your question the next question comes from alex twerdahl with piper sandler please go ahead alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co hi good morning guys ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning alex carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 good morning alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co well first of all can you just maybe help us get a sense for the ebbs and flows in the government deposits now that were out of bankruptcy sort of the expectation there the seasonality there that gets you back to that to range by the end of the year ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah i mean i think carlos talked about it more but we put out estimates usually based on our conversations with the treasury department and what their estimates are and its been theyve been all over the place on the positive side the economy in puerto ricos done better so they have generated a lot more tax revenues that they were anticipating on the expense side well there are some funds that we estimate around maybe billion that are covid related funds that are classified in public funds that have been sold to be dispersed and we would have anticipated maybe that they would have anticipated so the ebbs and flows traditionally and we live in a very unique world now with pandemic and all these funds is the taxes come in in april and then they pay the bonds in july july 1st is their principal payment those are the big ebbs and flows but and with the pandemic weve had big inflows of money for covid relief and other situations so its very hard for the government to predict and we sort of rely on them to predict the flows but over time those covid funds have to be spent or were going to lose them for example so that theyll have to go out and i think the government will have a better idea again we havent been out of bankruptcy for that long so theyre trying to stabilize their finances but i dont know carlos you want to add anything to that carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc we have been we have been very consistent on our forecasts of government policies by being wrong every quarter nine quarters were like that so again its not a lack of trying it is as ignacio said it is everything we communicate is our best guess given all the information we have from our clients remember the balance is not a single client to this theres hundreds of clients in there as well so its our best guess given the information but sometimes the clients themselves dont have as good information as they think the tax revenues being much higher this year is a good example of that so our best guess given all the all that we know today is that again well be back to the range that we expected by year end i have no idea whether the agreement that was announced today for some climate legislation will have money attached to it and whether some of that money will come to us and well change the forecast so theres all kinds of things like that affect us so its our best informed estimate given everything we know as of today but again weve missed it a few times alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co got it and then i mean i guess sort of a corollary or a following question to that is how do you think about your normalized level of liquidity obviously you got this chunk of deposits that could be anything in any given quarter but how much of that can actually be invested in a way that either into loan growth or into longer duration securities that you feel comfortable carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 well the its easier to focus on the government deposits because they are the biggest chunk in the deposit book but i think the answer to your question is a more holistic answer and whats going to happen with the deposit flows moving forward we fully expect that commercial deposits youve seen already in most banks in the mainland youve seen deposits go down already so were a little bit of an outlier that we had deposits going down in this quarter i think in the commercial front you will probably see a lot of pressure on deposits moving forward i mean the deposit outflows as our commercial clients had that have active treasury activities will look for a better yields on their liquidity so the commercial sector might actually see some outflows moving forward we havent seen it yet but that might be coming i think thats going to be much slower in the retail side the retail side tends to respond less quickly while some high net worth clients may move some deposits to higher yielding at alternatives i think the majority of clients will move slowly even to changing the retail clients move slowly so the big two pieces are going to be what ends up happening with commercial which again we shouldnt ignore it youve seen deposits commercial deposits coming down in many banks in the mainland already and then the government if we happen to be correct this time in our bonds prediction then theyll probably be down between billion billion billion by yearend alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay are you able to breakout the idea portion of your deposits that you consider to be not super sensitive to rates the retail or the stuff thats not going to have that dac and treasury management carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc well the most of it the rate is the government deposits and again with a lag but thats going to move in tandem to market so again keep in mind as i mentioned earlier we do earn a margin on that the difference so three months from now is that margin will not continue to increase it will stay in the it has increased for the last couple of months but it will not continue to increase once we reach that point where the deposits are pegged to market changes in the market so again theyll still be accretive well make we have a margin on it but the margin will get capped when the linkages is fully in place alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co got it i mean when i think about the rate sensitivity and sort of the change in the guide this quarter i mean theres another way to think about it just relative to last quarter that you just pulled forward im calculating around five rate hikes by deploying a billion into health maturity securities carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah i mean we think if there is increasing rate right so the question of whether you do about it if youre a bank you try to capture that that those higher rates into a balance sheet and weve done quite a bit of that by extending the bond portfolio and more importantly now also growing the loan portfolio so weve taken the action that we think makes sense to capture that increased margin moving forward but you cant do it twice right once you did it youve done it so that because theyve said theyll be moving forward and so i think the description is accurate alex that is part of what has happened already yes popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then if i remember correctly part of the evertec transaction was actually to recognize some revenue shares as well and i couldnt remember if that was something that was going to take impact this year or if as a event maybe you can just remind us kind of on the fee side how evertec is going to impact the complexion of the fee income in your guide for the next two quarters as well as how thats going to change next year with that revenue share component carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah it impacts the results immediately but the flip side of that is is by reducing our equity stake we also give up equity investments through the equity income income that also comes in to that line so you dont see the change in the line alex but yeah theres is a plus and minus they happen to be about the same size here obviously part of the logic behind the transaction is that we dont think theyll stay the same size and we think that the revenue linked the fees linked to the to the merchant business will actually outpace in growth the other side of the equation alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just a final question for me just back to the margin and the new loan yields that youre getting today loan yields in puerto rico seem to be a decent margin above us yields or these have been when rates were zero are you seeing loan betas or how is higher rates actually impacted new origination yields on commercial product carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc well weve seen overall loan yields go up by eight basis points in the quarter so we are trying to reflect the change in rates into our origination now the going yields its also depends on mix of number other things obviously but we are trying to reflect and new market conditions are in loan yield the new origination will change the loan yield slowly though because again we have a big base portfolio so theyve really made changes the loan will yield only on the margin ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc but alex if your question is more directed have these increases saw a decreased demand for commercial loans we havent seen that yet alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay but you are getting if you were if a commercial loan was had a five handle year ago is it coming on today with still a five handle or is it coming on today with the seven handle ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc neither popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc its definitely a higher handle but im not sure if its if the debate is or not the clients are sensitive to this as well alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co yeah carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc so if theyve five or seven handle they may choose to make the loan a bit shorter so the handle become six right alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks for taking my questions carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you operator thank you alex operator instructions the next question is from kelly motta with kbw please go ahead kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi thank you so much for the questions and good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning kelly carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning kelly kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc it must have been asked and answered but i did want to now that you have evertec closed thats a question about what youre doing on the technology investment side one of the strategic rationales for the deal was the flexibility it opens up can you talk about some of the things you look to do now that you have that deal closed and i think you cited increased tax spend as one of the areas of increase for expenses so if that was within what you had been planning to do or if theres new projects on board that werent previously in the guidance before popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc im not sure in terms of which projects are were in the guidance or not definitely by taking these client facing platforms take them over and bring them back in we now see we have greater ability to work on things that we had before we in general were looking to do is improve the origination process the digital origination process both on the consumer and on the commercial front thats something we work on were also going to be spending some money on our cash management systems which we think we need to upgrade this remain competitive so some of the big projects were working on there so i dont think that the evertec transaction as such has increased our spending what it has it has allowed us to have greater flexibility to look at things that we wanted to do anyway and do them so i dont know carlos you want to add any color there carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah i mean we may have most of the stuff around and it having closer transactions gives us the possibility of maybe choosing to do some of the things we hadnt planned a bit quicker but again weve only closed the transaction for a month now so you have to be able to have more time to put more numbers around that so but it is a possibility that things that we thought might take might we may start in a years or years we may now have the possibility or the option to start a bit faster or well make change around things when we want to do things so we may move big projects perhaps and have spent on x and do it later and then move for appraise to have a spend of or so but that is still early days in the process kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks so much and then i do appreciate all the color on the puts and takes of expenses in the second half of the year and kind of the noise around the hire from for profit sharing as you get out from from that how should we be thinking about what a normalized run rate looks like now that you took a step up on employee expenses and everything like that as we move past the second half of the year ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc its an excellent question and we dont have the answer to that question yet so we gave you what we can i think get our arms around with some degree of confidence which is the next two quarters we will provide you and the market with new average quarterly expense guidance for in our webcast in january of next year were not trying to be evasive or cute about this what ends up driving our expense guidance is all the projects and efforts that we decide to embark on next year that is a result of our budgeting and planning process and that process really goes on into sometime in late november so we will actually not know the number until we decide which projects were going to do or pursue and which ones were not and things of that sort that will decide later this year so i dont have the number yet we will give you guidance in january for a full kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood thank you so much for the color popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you operator thank you kelly we now have a followup question from timur with wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thanks for the followup maybe just adding on to kellys question and asking it a little different are you expecting kind of this million range for both third quarter and fourth quarter or is that kind of ramping up towards the fourth quarter and how are you thinking about kind of the fourth quarter exit rate carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah i mean it could move around a little bit within the two quarters our best guess is that the quarters will look very similar at million timur but it could be that its million or million or million and million or something like that it depends on when some things get going and get paid and that sort of stuff so we have a reasonable degree of confidence on the average for both quarters if you actually wanted to pin it down to one quarter the other i have a lesser degree of confidence on that timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and is there an expectation that an earnings credit rate is a component of the higher expense based and then maybe if you can just provide any color on what component of the public funds will see higher rates through ecr versus just higher deposit costs carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah i mean some of it is valid question so not all of the cost shows up through dangerous expense line some of the cost is in the fee section we have never broken it up that way it also will depend how they use how many services they use from us right thats part of the equation that goes in if they contract new services and then the mix between what goes into expense line and what goes into fee portion of the changes i dont have the number well well try to figure out if its something we can do something that makes sense on that but i dont have a number on top of my head timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks again for the follow up carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you operator thank you for your question i would now like to pass the conference back over to ignacio alvarez for any further remarks popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thanks again for joining us and for your
