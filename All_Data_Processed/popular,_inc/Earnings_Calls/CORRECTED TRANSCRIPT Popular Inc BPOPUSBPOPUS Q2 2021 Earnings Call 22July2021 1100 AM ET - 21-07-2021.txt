risk management please turn to slide our current net income of million was million lower than the first quarter and million higher than the same quarter of the quarteroverquarter variance was driven by a lower benefit in the provision for credit losses compared to last quarter higher revenues and lower expenses the increase in net interest income was driven by higher income from our investment portfolio and lower deposit costs our non interest income increased due to higher volume of credit and debit card transaction credit quality trends were positive in the quarter with lower npls and net

earnings call 22jul2021 cement sales have remained strong yeartodate sales of cement were higher than the level of sales that were seen during the last during the same time period in and when the island was rebuilding following the hurricanes the improvement in the tourism and hospitality sector has been extraordinary with much of the world travel still somewhat limited puerto rico continues to be a popular destination for mainland residents that have become more comfortable with traveling additionally earlier this month the cdc improved its assessment of the risk of contracting covid in

prepandemic levels total nonfarm employment has increased by since december and by since june we are extremely pleased with the results for the second quarter we continue to be very optimistic about the economic recovery but will remain attentive to how the evolving health situation may impact the economic outlook i now turn the call over to carlos for more details on our financial results carlos j vázquez executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you ignacio good morning please turn to slide as usual additional information is provided in the appendix to the slide deck todays earnings press release details variances from the first quarter net interest income for the second quarter was million an increase of million from  driven by increased balances in the investment portfolio and lower deposit cost noninterest income increased by million to million in  contributing to these results were higher credit card interchange fees of million plus million higher net earnings from investments held under the equity method along with various other smaller positive variances this is almost entirely offset by million lower mortgage banking income primarily due to a negative quarterover quarter variance in msr valuations of million versus a positive variance of million in  the provision for the second quarter was a benefit of million this was million lower than the million benefit recorded in the first quarter lidio will expand on creditrelated matters total operating expenses were million in the quarter down million from  the decrease was primarily due to lower employee compensation cost by million mostly driven by seasonality of compensation plans and lower other operating expenses by million primarily due to a reserve release on our mortgage servicing popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 business these were partially offset by higher customer reward program expense of million resulting from increased credit card transactions as well as slightly higher advertising costs for the full year we now expect our average quarterly expenses to be million to million million per quarter higher than our prior estimate a number of factors contributed to this increase we expect compensation expense to be higher due to continued business outperformance as well as increased competition for talent some projects and activities that were delayed in the first half of the year should materialize in the second half and finally we also expect higher processing and technology costs our effective tax rate for the quarter was compared to in the first quarter this increase was primarily due to a higher proportion of taxable income in puerto rico for we now expect our effective tax rate to be between and which is an increase from our prior range of to please turn to slide nii on a taxable equivalent basis was million million higher than in the first quarter the primary drivers of the increase were higher interest income from the investment portfolio by million due to a billion increase in average balances lower deposit cost by million and an additional million of income due to one more day in the quarter deposits grew by billion in the quarter this increase was spread across all business lines the majority of the growth was in puerto rico government deposits but similar to  our retail and commercial deposits increased by billion nim decreased by basis points to in  on a taxable equivalent basis nim was a decrease of basis points the lower margin is due to asset mix meaning higher balances of lowyielding money market and investment securities the total loan yield decreased by basis points in  as a result of lower ppp related income of million compared to million in the first quarter ppp loans yielded approximately this quarter compared to last quarter the reduction in yield was due to slower accelerated recognition of fee income upon forgiveness the remaining unamortized portion of fees for the ppp portfolio is approximately million we believe most of the remaining million first round ppp loans will be forgiven during the third and fourth quarters of this year and a majority of the million second round ppp loans by the middle of next year we expect margin will continue to drop in  due to continued high levels of deposits but should recover towards the yearend the ultimate result will depend on our asset mix and the rate of forgiveness of ppp loans as of the end of the second quarter puerto rico public deposits were roughly billion an increase of just over billion from last quarter these balances reflect the most recent cares act federal stimulus including assistance to state and local governments we continue to expect public deposit balances to come down over time driven by outlays of funds advanced from the cares and jobs act the restructuring of public sector debt and their return to current debt service our ending loan balances decreased by million in the quarter this decline was due to a million decline in ppp loans partially offset by an increase of million in the auto and leased portfolio first round ppp loans dropped by million while second round disbursements were approximately million excluding the impact of ppp loan balances grew by million we continue to see strong demand and net portfolio growth in auto loans and leases while other loan portfolios are either flat or have decreased since the first quarter we expect loan balances will continue to be impacted by ppp forgiveness as well as limited demand resulting from popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 unprecedented levels of clients liquidity as such we do not expect overall long growth to materialize until next year when the demand resulting from expected economic growth should outpace forgiveness of ppp loans please turn to slide our capital levels remain strong relative to mainland peers and well capitalized regulatory requirements our common equity tier ratio in  was down basis points from  primarily due to capital actions in april the corporation entered into a million accelerated share repurchase transaction as a result recognizing shareholders equity approximately million interestfree stock and million as a reduction of capital surplus the final accounting treatment for the program will depend on the average price of the stock during the term of the asr scheduled to close in  our eps in  increased by because of this transaction we will continue to explore opportunities to manage our capital during the remainder of and in future periods however we do not expect further dividend increases or common stock repurchases this year we have returned to our normal capital planning schedule this year hopefully resulting in an announcement of populars capital actions no later than our january webcast our stockholders equity decreased in the quarter primarily due to the impact of the million asr however our tangible book value per share increased by to this increase was driven by our quarterly net income higher cumulative unrealized gains on investments and a lower share count our return on tangible equity was in the second quarter with that i turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano executive vice president and chief risk officer popular inc thank you carlos and good morning during the second quarter the corporation continued to exhibit strong credit quality metrics and low credit costs driven by the improving economic environment please turn to slide number to discuss credit metrics nonperforming assets decreased by million to million this quarter mainly driven by an npl decrease of million offset in part by an increase of million in npls held for sale in puerto rico npls decreased by million mainly due to lower mortgage npls of million resulting from lower inflows and continued improvements in early in multi trends coupled with lower consumer npls mainly in the regulatory these decreases were offset in part by higher commercial npls of million mainly due to the inflow from a single million noncovid related clients this increase was offset in part by the resolution of a million npl relationship that resulted in a significant recovery in the us npls decreased by million mostly related to a construction loan transferred to held for sale the ratio of npls to total loans held in portfolio was flat versus the prior quarter please turn to slide number to discuss npl inflows compared to the first quarter npl inflows excluding consumer loans increased by million driven by an increase of million in puerto rico mainly due to the previously mentioned commercial relationship this increase was offset in part by lower mortgage npl inflows of million in the us npl inflows decreased by million as the prior quarter included a million construction loan that reached days to its renewal process was current at the end of the quarter turning to slide number net chargeoffs amounted to a net recovery of million for annualized negative basis points of average loans held in portfolio compared to net chargeoffs of million or basis points in the previous quarter popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 the results for the quarter was aided by the recovery of million related to the resolution of the above mentioned nonperforming relationship excluding this the net charge off ratio would have been audio gap healthy portfolio decreased to from in the prior quarter excluding payment protection program loans and guaranteed mortgage loans this ratio is the ratio of allowance for credit losses to npl held in portfolio was flat to the prior quarter please turn to slide number to discuss details on the drivers of the variance in our allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses decreased by million when compared to the previous quarter variances were driven by changes to qualitative research and economic outlook as well as portfolio credit quality and mix while a strong recovery is evident we also consider more adverse adverse outcomes even uncertainties around the impact of the new virus strains and the puerto rico governments ability to utilize available cellular treatments as a result we continue to assign a high probability to the baseline scenario followed by the more pessimistic best three scenarios our macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables with the unemployment rate and gdp being the largest drivers the current baseline scenarios shows a slight improvement in both gdp growth and unemployment rates when compared to the previous estimates however revisions to historical macroeconomic indicators conducted by the puerto rico planning board contributed to increases in the allowance for credit losses in puerto rico these revisions caused acl to increase by million during the quarter we released million from our qualitative research prompted by the economic environment and improvements in borrower performance total popular changes caused acl to decrease by million portfolio changes include fluctuations in credit quality volume and mix to summarize our loan portfolio exhibited improved credit quality metrics during the second quarter aided by the government stimulus and an improving economic environment we will continue to monitor the exposure of the portfolios to pandemicrelated risk and changes in the economic outlook with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks thank you ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you lidio and carlos for your update our results for the first half of were strong driven by solid earnings improved credit quality record deposit levels continued consumer growth and our capital actions we are optimistic about the economic outlook in addition to the unprecedented level of federal stimulus related to covid puerto rico still has a significant amount of hurricane recovery funds that have yet to be disbursed which we expect will now start flowing at a faster pace the combined impact of these factors and improved consumer confidence should generate considerable economic activity in many sectors for the coming years and we are wellpositioned to benefit from such activity we are looking forward to having the entire team together in our office again even progress in the vaccination process a general improvement in health conditions and sound safety protocols in our facilities we will begin to bring back to the office our colleagues that are still working remotely managers and supervisors will be returning in midaugust and the remainder of our workforce will return after labor day we will however be offering eligible employees a hybrid work arrangement popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 in june we released our second annual corporate sustainability report it highlights our commitment progress and achievements in our initiatives to operate as a responsible ethical and sustainable company we are mindful of the responsibility we have as puerto ricos leading banking institution and in fact to all the communities we serve we had a full commitment to continue expand our levels of transparency around our esg practices and we will continue working to ensure we have a positive impact on all our stakeholders you can find the report on our website we are now ready to answer your questions question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from brock vandervliet of ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hi there good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc morning brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc could you talk more about loan growth and what you see i think carlos youre very clear youre not expecting growth until next year i guess im trying to put together what appears to be multiple economic data points pointing toward a resurgence of economic growth and the lack of it in the loan book maybe if you talk about utilization or origination pipelines anything that could kind of help us triangulate thanks carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc sure well the first comment on loan growth is that i think our bankers are doing a pretty good job originating loans if you take out the effect of ppp in this quarter we actually grew loans by a million so thats a nice start the reason we keep pointing to net loan growth in is that even though our bankers are doing a pretty good job we still have number one clients with very high levels of liquidity and the average commercial and retail client of popular their average balance has grown by more than since february of last year so our average client has a significant amount of liquidity in their accounts and the other is just a normal flow of our business if you think assume for a moment brock that the ppp1 whatever is left of it which is million goes away by year end thats probably in the right ballpark we have our old western bank portfolio that amortizes about million a quarter so thats another million and the popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 normal amortization schedule of our mortgage books is this is so large despite the fact that our origination is doing very well its still a negative number its probably in excess of million a quarter so when you take those three pieces along theres a lot of other moving pieces obviously you have a portfolio that on their natural flow alone will come back come down about million so if our bank has bang up job they make that up but the net growth they have to make that up and then do some more so the reason we are still thinking about is a combination of clients with a significant amount of liquidity and the fact that we still have to overcome the natural runoff of of our book now this is one in which we hope were wrong i hope the growth shows up earlier than that but i think that our best guess right now is that when these balances start going the other way will probably be early brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay appreciate that color and anything under the hood in terms of loan efforts to open new lines of credit on the ci side that havent been drawn yet as a result of some of the economic pickup were seeing ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc i think we the activity so its ignacio the activity were seeing is pretty normal i think many of our clients as carlos said many of our existing clients have existing lines the one area i would say you probably see more activity is you are seeing more i think investor interest in puerto rico again so i think were seeing more new activity like acquisition loans or finding business or buying properties more than lines of credit because most of our commercial clients like i said have plenty of liquidity and they have available lines so they dont really need new lines but we are seeing more and more activity on the acquisition front brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right thank you operator the next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning ignacio and carlos how are you guys carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning george ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning george gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 carlos coming back to the liquidity comment you were making about your customers can we tie that to the deposit growth as well ex the government deposit growth what do you think is driving that liquidity is it primarily the stimulus programs meaning ppp and then from a consumer side the stimulus checks or is there something else going on in addition to that that is driving that liquidity and therefore youre still seeing these nice deposit levels or higher deposit level ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc this is ignacio i think there is no doubt that the stimulus payment had a big effect i mean a lot of money came directly into peoples accounts and they didnt spend at all i also think that for a while people didnt have the ability to really spend their money they couldnt travel they couldnt do other things they werent commuting so they saved on gas so there was a number of things that people i think were building up liquidity so i would expect that going forward that liquidity build is not going to continue because this was a special period but theres still a lot of money in the bank to actually to my surprise you hear a lot of stories about people buying cars and refrigerators and by the way we know theyre doing that but they still have money in the bank carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah and gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc go ahead carlos sorry carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah you can actually see the client activities continue to go up when you look at our the usage of our debit and credit cards so they are continuing to spend that money but it will probably take them a few months before the other interesting thing to think about is remember that when a client spends money when a retail client spends the money they have in their account with us theres a better than not chance that that becomes the deposit in the commercial accounts of clients of us so there is a circular effect that some while their money is moving you may not see a net reduction in our deposit balance simply because its moving back and forth now the flip side of that is also true if the client spends the money in walmart it goes to the states right so its a combination of things but there is a little bit of flow here that goes from one type of account to another too gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and when your line officers or when you guys go out and talk to your clients is there any determination yet that because of what we have come through and now they have these higher levels of liquidity could this be permanent where lets say like your auto dealers youre obviously very big in the auto business are they going to just run with lower inventory levels permanently and just use higher margins any sense of that yet that this could be a permanent shift and not something temporary popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc no i well i could tell you i had been getting out more and seeing clients i havent heard that i mean i think inventory levels are relatively low in large part because they cant get more inventory but i dont think thats going to happen i think once the market levels off again there are going to be very competitive pressures for people to reduce their margins i dont i think itll level set i also expect i mean many of our clients went through a difficult period where liquidity was king right when youre in a tough situation so i think they will hold more liquidity probably if you think about the experience indiscernible but also i think theyre waiting to see to this recovery take hold and then many of them will decide whether they need to invest and expand and thats why i think carlos was saying we expect to see more loan growth later on because people are not going to want to miss business so right now theyre stretching their capacity to generate the demand thats there at some point theyre going to have to increase their capacity not just stretch it so thats what we are waiting for gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a follow up question maybe this is for lidio the large credit that went on nonaccrual this quarter if you could maybe give us some color what caused that to go on and what type of credit it is and then second i think you also mentioned that a large construction loan that was days past due in the first quarter went back to performing status maybe some color on how you did that and then the third part of the question in your outlook for the allowance i noticed that in the first quarter baseline the unemployment rate assumption in puerto rico for was and now in the second quarter the baseline unemployment rate is which i found odd considering all the positive economic trends we are hearing about in puerto rico so if you dont mind if you could address those questions thank you lidio v soriano a executive vice president and chief risk officer popular inc lets see if i can remember all three but beginning with the first one gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc ill help you lidio v soriano a executive vice president and chief risk officer popular inc okay thank you so much gerard as i mentioned in the prepared remarks the nonperforming relationship was noncovid related it is a pharmaceutical company whose one of its main product went off patent and they have also issues related to trying to get new products get fda approved so thats really the issue behind that one company the second question was relating ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 the construction loan gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc the construction loan lidio v soriano a executive vice president and chief risk officer popular inc as we mentioned in the last webcast this was a relationship that while in the renewal process went past the days maturity and therefore given our policy we entered into nonaccrual but it was refinanced within or restructured within at the end of the quarter so thats why i went back to being current so it was also to some extent lets call it administrative or technical delinquencies and then as it relates to the unemployment rate as you know as you are aware we use moodys services to estimate unemployment i think when you look at the baseline even though it is true that it went up in it actually went down in so overall when you look overall unemployment rate for puerto rico for the whole the recent indiscernible period it actually went down thats why we mentioned are looking at an economic forecast from quartertoquarter was a slight improvement from one to the other gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you thank you lidio next quarterly ill ask a four part question for you i think you handled that one pretty well thank you guys lidio v soriano a executive vice president and chief risk officer popular inc thanks operator operator instructions the next question is from alex twerdahl with piper sandler please go ahead alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning alex lidio v soriano a executive vice president and chief risk officer popular inc good morning alex alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 i just wanted to go back to some of the different components of loan growth expectations its my understanding theres some rather large construction projects potentially being sponsored somewhat by the cdbg money that potentially could come online in the next couple of quarters and you see disbursements that could i dont know potentially meaningfully impact construction loan balances across the banks and obviously i would expect you guys to get more than your fair share of that can you talk about some of those projects and the expectations for the timings for some of those disbursements and whether thats something that we can expect this year ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah this is ignacio so yes that the fema process is quite complicated so theres a large number of public projects theyre going to be done and they run across a gambit of some thatll be done by the state such as roads the highway authority some that will be through prepa which is now luma will handle the funds some will be aqueduct and sewer authority and some will be the municipality i always tell people that is the year where youre not going to see a lot of disbursements because although fema has finally approved and signed off on the budgets for many of these projects and have assigned an amount they still have to go through the design process they have to go through a permanent process and that and they have to sign a construction contract all that requires bidding through fema so in terms of the federal fund i think is more a prefatory sort of stage i dont think well see big dollars therell be dollars going out because obviously therell be dollars going out to architects and people that are working on that and some of the smaller scale municipal projects youll see outlaid but i think the big projects youre not going to see big outlays until just because thats the way the process works its a lengthy process it requires bidding in every stage you have to bid for the architectural work you have to bid for the construction work you have to permit unfortunately in puerto rico we probably do not set the gold standard for the permitting process so that complicates everything so i dont think in private sector you will see more home i think residential construction the residential construction market is very hot that takes time again youve got to find the land youve got to get the permits but i think it definitely we have seen not only in the public side but i think you are going to see in the private side in the residential construction is very the market is very very very tight right now theres very very little housing supply available so youll see developers that takes time again part of being an island theres not a lot of zoneable land available so it takes time to get the land together get the permits but dont think only about the fema yeah thats going to be used but therell also be private construction i think coming along but i dont see much of that happening until in terms of the big disbursements alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co when you talk about the big disbursements can you give us some sort of sense for what sort of magnitude of some of those projects might be and like how big a component bpop will be willing to finance ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 i dont have it on a projectbyproject basis but billion has been assigned to the power authority for improvements in the power right billion has been assigned to the aqueduct and sewer authority for approving that so those are big projects highway i dont have the number on highway but highway had another couple of hundred million dollars so most of what we have been doing because lot of that is being financed by federal funds our biggest participation to date has not been like project financing but it has been financing the contractors who do the work so in many of these projects they have to put out the work and advance funds before they get reimbursed so much of what we anticipate will happen is that our construction clients will have to increase their lines and draw more down to do these projects obviously on the private side its a little bit different we will finance the construction there but on the public side i dont think that really is the case i think well be financing more the people involved the contractors the architects the suppliers of materials that type of thing i think thats whats going to be our sweet spot instead of traditional project financing alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay understood and then what about weve heard a lot about the residential market being pretty hot right now a lot of the mortgage loans that you guys are doing are conforming and youre selling them but as the jumbo market coming back in a more meaningful way is that something that could help to offset more of that residential run off as we look out to next couple of years ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah i mean i think there is a couple of things there i mean i think carlos and lidio can add to this but i think there is a limit on how much we want to do nonconforming i dont think we have a problem right now feeling up our appetite for nonconforming and one of the things we are managing is because of this incredible demand we are seeing in puerto rico we are seeing a big jumbo market developed where it really wasnt there before we are playing very heavily in it as we probably heard dorado indiscernible these are housing we are making mortgages million million million that we never did in our history so our biggest issue there is not so much getting that its adjusting our risk tolerance for how much that we can have its definitely helping but we in this kind of low rate interest environment we dont want to make too big a bet on holding mortgages in our balance sheet apart from the risk of the residential market really being hot now i mean weve seen things weve never seen in our lifetime in puerto rico houses selling for million million we never seen we never saw that in our lifetime alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co well a couple of other questions for me just when i look at the deposit flows with billion of public deposits i know you guys expect that to eventually come down over time do you have any better sense for i mean i know we have about a billion slug that once the geos reach resolution could flow out but other chunks in terms of the timing of those deposits is there any way we can kind of pin different chunks here or there as something that could flow out later this year popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well i think the biggest chunks the covid money comes in and goes out pretty fast so i dont have so i think the biggest needle mover is going to be the plan of adjustment the plan of adjustment not only has money to pay the geos they said about billion but there is other disbursements i think they are talking about disbursement up to billion as part of that plan of adjustment so thats going to be the biggest mover and its going to probably change the perspective in a couple of ways one a big chunk of money will go out progress has been made on that front its taken forever but its probably one of the most complex bankruptcy proceedings in the history of united states and its finally making progress recently an agreement was reached with the unsecured creditors committee which is a big deal because they were very active and very aggressive they seem to have almost if not already reached a deal with most of the monoline insurance which also was a big issue so as they moved forward really the one big issue left is how you handle the pensions and as you know theres a provision in there that the amount of any pension thats above a month of it will be reduced that has been very controversial with the government and they claim so they claim they will not get they cant accept that so thats really the last big piece of the puzzle thats left so most people are expecting that we should have a resolution of that by the end of the year or early next year because the judge is moving the calendar so i think were finally looking at a very possible solution at least involving the central government debt im not prepa will get done so were pretty optimistic about that and so thats going to be a big outflow of funds and then secondly i think once the government of puerto rico knows what it can count on then you can expect that it will start maybe using its funds or investing its funds a little bit differently so well have to see what happens but literally right now they dont know what they can count so theyre just parking the money with us but as they enter a more normal environment where they know where they can count on i think you can expect for them to make perhaps change how they handle their money somewhat alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co got it and then just sticking on the topic of deposits in terms of the rates you guys are paying i imagine theres not a whole lot of room to reduce the rates but maybe there is some opportunity to increase fees related to deposits i mean you can talk about whether or not that is the case and sort of how youre thinking about that ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah i know youve got to be careful there because deposit franchise is a longterm asset and you dont want to get a reputation as nickelanddiming your deposit clients just because youre in a loan deposit market theyre already getting hurt with the low interest were paying so i think i dont think there in terms of deposit fees no but obviously as the economy picks up and you saw this quarter we do expect our other sources of fee income to improve we saw a nice rise in fees related to debit and credit cards i think insurance over time will continue to go up as people recognize the value and the need of insurance and we continue to build out our business there popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 so we are definitely looking for fees but its not we cannot put in risk of that into our deposit franchise so were especially with other fintechs and everyone else competing so i dont think itll be coming from deposit fees it will be more from other services where we get a fee by providing value to our clients thats really what we strive for carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc on the cost to deposit alex youre correct its hard puerto rico is hard to sort of get it to bring it down our total cost of deposit now is basis points which is close to i think last but we did we do still have some room to bring the deposit down cost down in popular bank there we have done a pretty good job were down to a total cost of deposit of basis points from probably a few quarters back so there still is a little bit more room in the us but also keep in mind that its a smaller portion of our deposit book so the overall effect of even getting some savings there in total will be muted alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co great and then just a final question for me which i think i asked last year as well but just so that everyone on the call understands the accounting behind the asr my understanding is that weve seen the full impact of the million come out of equity already but weve only seen about of the shares come out of the share count and so we should see an adjustment at the end of the third quarter where we could see this share count reduced a bit further but there shouldnt be much of an impact to equity is that correct carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc your understanding is correct you described it well alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co fantastic thank you for taking my questions carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thanks operator the next question is a follow up from brock vandervliet of ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks carlos if you could just review the guide on expenses and kind of walk us up from what looked like around million this quarter to the million back to the million million guidance whats changing there carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 yeah i tried to sort of list what the components are going to be but the main drivers are going to be three things first we do expect our compensation expenses to go up part of that is normal course of business for example we do our merit increases in the year in july so naturally the second half of the year will have higher personnel expenses the compensation is also affected by the overall performance of the company so if we continue to outperform as we have for the first couple of quarters that would increase compensation expenses as well and lastly the competition for talent is real and we are not excluded from that in puerto rico so were seeing that also affect what we have to offer for new employees what we have to offer our existing employees so that they stay happy and want to stay with the bank so all those components will continue to contribute to higher compensation expense in the second quarter we managed to have gotten a little bit of a break on that front because were also a little bit behind in our hiring of the people that we need you may have seen that number of employees went down slightly so maybe weve got a little bit of a break in the second quarter that expenses that should have been in this line did not show up simply because we havent been able to hire all the people we need and want to hire hopefully we can correct that and that again will reflect on higher compensation expenses second is timing there is some projects and expenses that we had sort of scheduled in to be onefourth of the expense every quarter and some of those projects or expenses just simply havent started or have been delayed some business activities that are related to those projects continue so we expect those activities to still happen but theyre just happening later in the year so we think that will end up in higher expenses and lastly a little bit of normal course of business as our clients feel better and do more transactions our processing costs will go up and like every other bank in the world theres nothing that will keep your technology costs from going up between compliance and cyber and regulatory stuff technology cost seems to be something that will continue to go up and unfortunately we are no exception to that trend so the combination of all those things will increase our raw expense base as you know we normally describe our expense on an average quarterly number you are correct that we were slightly below the range we have described in the first two quarters of the year and that will by in fact by necessity means that we will be above that range in the second two quarters of the year and thats our best guess on expenses right now we hope to be set by the way we hope for the better but this is our best guess of what expenses will be brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then just separately on credit given where net chargeoffs are the economic backdrop what would you need to see to get conviction that perhaps looking ahead were looking at a much lower net chargeoff pattern than youve seen historically and youd have the flexibility to further reduce reserves just trying to better understand how youre thinking about the reserving carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc well for one thing reserve is slightly more scientific than it used to be in the past so theres a lot of it that is modeldriven so we have certain latitude but maybe not as much as you think in terms of how we can feel comfortable or not with in lowering reserve having said that i mean the allowance for credit losses is driven by the performance past performance credit quality economic outlook and taking into account environmental factors if the trends that we have seen popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 continues in which losses continue to be low credit quality will continue to improve and if the economic outlook continue to improve we should reasonably expect the allowance will continue to trend lower as we progress through the rest of into brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thanks for taking my questions
