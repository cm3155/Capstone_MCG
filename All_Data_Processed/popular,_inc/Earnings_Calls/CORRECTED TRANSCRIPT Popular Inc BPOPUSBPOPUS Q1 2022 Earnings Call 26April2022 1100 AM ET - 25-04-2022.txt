and prudent risk management please turn to slide our quarterly net income of million was million higher than the fourth quarter and million lower than the same quarter of which included significant reserve releases the sequential variance is driven by lower expenses and a lower tax rate partially offset by a lower benefit in the provision for credit losses lower net interest income and lower fee income during the quarter loan growth was solid and broad based both geographically and across all loan segments commercial loans grew during the period above bppr and pb despite the continued runoff of ppp loans our margins in puerto rico continue to be impacted by our asset mix however we are wellpositioned to benefit from higher market rates credit quality trends continue to be favorable during the period with a low level of net chargeoffs and decreasing nonperforming loans with increasing expectations to digitize and improve our customer experience we are constantly assessing and investing in our capabilities in february we entered into an agreement with evertec to acquire key customerfacing channels and to extend important commercial agreements we expect this transaction will allow us to enhance our client experience and provide us with greater flexibility to meet our customers needs during the quarter we continued to return capital to our shareholders in march we entered into a million accelerated share repurchase program and on april we paid a dividend of per common share an increase of per share please turn to slide our customer base in puerto rico grew by more than in the first quarter to reach million unique customers adoption of digital channels among our retail customers continues to be strong active users of our mi banco platform exceeded million and have grown by since march and by since march we captured twothirds of deposits during the quarter through digital channels this trend remains significantly higher than during prepandemic levels commercial loan growth is solid during the first quarter excluding ppp loans commercial loan balances at bppr increased by million or auto loan and lease balances at bppr increased by versus the fourth quarter and consumer demand remains robust the dollar value of credit and debit card sales for our customers has continued to trend higher increasing by compared to the same quarter a year ago the housing market continues to be strong however mortgage originations have been impacted by rising rates the dollar value of mortgage originations at bppr decreased by yearoveryear in the first quarter but was more than higher than the same period in and please turn to slide for an update on the current macroeconomic environment in puerto rico the puerto rico economy performed well during the first quarter with business trends and customer activity remaining solid auto sales increased by in the first quarter compared to the same period in this was the highest level of new auto sales seen during the first quarter in more than a decade the puerto rico economic activity index which includes total employment cement sales electricity generation and gasoline sales has been steadily improving and has exceeded prepandemic levels for more than the past five months popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 we are particularly encouraged by the positive employment trends in march total employment in puerto rico reached its highest level in recent history additionally the march unemployment rate of is the lowest since records began nearly years ago it is especially encouraging that the decrease in unemployment levels was accompanied by an increase in the participation rate airport traffic also continue to improve passenger volume during the first quarter increased compared to the same period a year ago and also exceeded the very strong traffic seen in the first quarter of the tourism and hospitality sector continue to be a source of strength to the local economy puerto rico is a popular destination for mainland residents and the recent increase in covid cases does not appear to be having the same impact on consumer demand for travel as prior surges have had we believe that the recently completed debt restructuring should be an important catalyst for puerto ricos fiscal and economic recovery in short we are very pleased with the results for the quarter we continue to be optimistic about the prospects for the future yet remain attentive to how the evolving geopolitical inflation and health situations may impact the economy and our clients i now turn the call over to carlos for more detail on our financial results carlos j vázquez executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you ignacio good morning please turn to slide as usual additional information is provided in the appendix to the slide deck todays earnings press release detail variances from the fourth quarter net interest income for the first quarter was million a decrease of million from  the variance spike was driven by lower ppp related income and lower income from pcb loan repayments and bppr along with the impact of two fewer days in the quarter this was somewhat offset by higher income from loan growth at bppr and pb as well as a higher balance of investment securities noninterest income decreased by million to million the decrease in other service fees was mainly related to seasonality in credit and debit card fees which were lower by million due to higher purchasing activity in  and million contingent insurance commissions that typically happen in the last quarter of the year income from mortgage banking activities was million lower mainly driven by lower gain on securitization activities resulting from lower volume of transactions and unrealized premiums these negative variances were partially offset by million in higher income from investments held under the equity method we continue to expect that the average quarterly level of noninterest income will be around million to million the provision for the first quarter was a benefit of million this was million lower than the benefit recorded in the fourth quarter total operating expenses were million in the quarter a decrease of million from  this was driven by three factors first an million decrease in business promotion expenses primarily impacted by lower expenses associated with seasonal advertising charitable donations and credit card rewards second an million decrease in other operating expenses driven by lower sundry losses by million mainly related to the termination of a white label credit card contract and the million impairment losses on undeveloped properties taken in  popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 finally a million decrease in amortization of intangibles due to the writedown of a trademark in  these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in employment compensation cost mostly driven by higher incentives and commissions as well as seasonality in payroll taxes that increased by million a million increase in credit and debit card processing expenses due in part to lower volume incentives and a million increase in professional fees for we continue to expect our average quarterly expenses to be around million we will of course strive to come in below this expected level of expenses our effective tax rate for the quarter was in we expect the effective tax rate to be between and please turn to slide net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was million million higher than in the fourth quarter net interest margin decreased by basis points to in  on a taxable equivalent basis nim was an increase of basis points the increase in fte margin was driven primarily by higher yields on our investment portfolio by basis points due to asset composition and improved market rates during the quarter average balance of us treasury securities increased by billion while the average balance of money market investments decreased by billion the fte loan deal decreased by basis points in  to driven by lower ppp amortization ppp income in  was million down from million in the prior quarter due to lower recognition of fees upon forgiveness and lower balances the yield of the portfolio was compared to in  the outstanding quarterly balance of ppp loans was million the remaining unamortized portion of fees for this portfolio is million most of which we expect to recognize during the second quarter excluding public deposits deposit balances grew by billion in the quarter as of the end of the first quarter public deposits were roughly billion a decrease of billion from  while the aggregate deposit outflow associated with the completion of the puerto ricos debt restructuring was approximately billion we saw billion additional public deposit inflows during the first quarter we now expect public deposit balances to fluctuate between billion and billion slightly higher than our prior estimates the outflow of public deposits and the deployment of a portion of our cash position into loans and investments have reduced our asset sensitivity but we will continue to benefit from rising rates as of march each 25basispoint change in fed funds would correspond to million to million in nii per quarter our ending loan balances increased by million this increase occurred despite a decrease of million in ppp loans excluding the impact of ppp loan balances grew by million in  reflecting higher commercial loan balances at bppr and popular bank higher construction balances and to a lesser extent higher auto and personal loans these balance increases were offset in part by continued runoff of the mortgage loan portfolio in puerto rico we are encouraged by the demand for credit at bppr and pb as net growth has occurred earlier than expected we will continue to take advantage of the evolution of the economy and the opportunity to extend credit so we can continue to improve the use and yield of our existing liquidity please turn to slide capital levels remain strong our common equity tier ratio in  was compared to in  tangible book value per share in the quarter was or a decrease driven by four factors billion higher accumulated unrealized losses on debt securities available for sale as a result of rising interest rates the impact of the million accelerated share repurchase program the corporation entered into in february and declared quarterly common stock dividends this was partially offset by the quarterly net income popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 of million the lower marktomarket valuation of our investment portfolio will not have an impact on our regulatory capital ratios while this is a large variance in tangible book value the decrease in fair value of the investment portfolio should be temporary our investment portfolio is nearly entirely comprised of treasury and agency mortgagebacked securities which carry minimal credit risk the bond portfolio has a duration of approximately four years and as the positions grow down the yield curve their fair value will converge to par and they mark down to zero despite extension of some cash into the investment portfolio over the last few quarters we continue to have large cash balances continued extension of available liquidity into the investment portfolio would lead to higher earnings and improved tax effective markets in this interest rate environment our return on tangible equity was in the quarter as a result of the asr we recognized in shareholders equity approximately million in treasury stock and million as a reduction in capital surplus the final accounting treatment of the program will depend on the average price of the shares during the term of the asr scheduled to close in  our eps in  increased by as a result of this transaction our capital planning schedule should result in an announcement of populars capital actions no later than our january webcast the announced intention to redeploy the net gains expected from the sale of our evertec stake is subject to the closing of the transaction and regulatory approvals as of now the closing is still expected for midyear we will continue to explore opportunities to manage our capital structure through the remainder of and in future periods with that i turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc thank you carlos and good morning overall popular continue to exhibit strong credit quality trends and low credit costs with low levels of net chargeoffs and decreasing npls we continue to closely monitor changes in borrower performance and the pace of economic recovery given the rising interest rate environment and geopolitical uncertainty however we remain optimistic given recent credit performance economic outlook and improvements in the risk profile of the corporations loan portfolio turning to slide number nonperforming assets decreased by million to million this quarter mainly driven by an npl decrease of million offset in part by an oreo increase of million the decreasing npls was mainly in puerto rico this was driven by lower mortgage npls of million primarily due to the combined effects of collection efforts increased foreclosure activity and the ongoing low levels of early delinquency compared with prepandemic trends in the us npls remained flat quarteroverquarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year npl inflows excluding consumer loans remained flat in puerto rico total inflows increased by million driven by higher commercial by million and higher mortgage by million in the us inflows decreased by million driven by a million reduction in the mortgage portfolio as the prior quarter included the impacts of loans that did not resume payment after the end of the covidrelated moratorium the order increase in the quarter was driven by the resumption of foreclosure activity in the puerto rico mortgage portfolio at the end of the quarter the ratio of npls to total loans held in portfolio was compared to in the previous quarter turning to slide number net chargeoffs amounted to million or our annualized 5basispoint of average loans held in portfolio compared to a net recovery of million in the previous quarter the variance in net chargeoff was mainly driven by the resolution in puerto rico of certain commercial nonperforming loans in the popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 prior quarter the corporation allowance for credit losses decreased by million or to million driven mainly by reductions in qualitative reserve due to substantial improvements in employment levels in puerto rico the ratio allowance for credit losses to loans held in portfolio decreased slightly to compared to in the previous quarter the ratio of allowance for credit losses to npls held in portfolio was compared to in the prior quarter the provision for credit losses was a benefit of million compared to a benefit of million in the previous quarter in puerto rico the provision for credit losses was a benefit of million while in the us the provision was a benefit of million please turn to slide number the indiscernible allowance for credit losses was driven by changes to qualitative reserves and economic outlook as well as portfolio credit quality and mix during the quarter we released million from our qualitative reserves driven by improvements in employment levels in puerto rico in accordance with its usual practice the bureau of labor statistics completed its annual benchmark revision to the establishment survey employment series which yielded significant improvements in better employment as a result we released qualitative reserves associated with uncertainties due to the employment situation in puerto rico after covid changes in economic scenario driven by fiscal assumptions caused the acl to increase by million however the macroeconomic scenarios for puerto rico and the us continue to show a positive outlook for the economy portfolio changes driven mainly by credit quality portfolio growth and volume mix caused the acl to increase by million to summarize our loan portfolio exhibited strong credit quality metrics with low net chargeoffs and decrease in nonperforming loans we are optimistic given recent credit performance economic outlook improvements in the risk profile of the corporations loan portfolios with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks thank you ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you lidio and carlos for your updates popular started off with a strong quarter building on the positive momentum seen in our results were driven by strong earnings improved credit quality and continued customer growth our planned capital actions reflect this strength in addition to the unprecedented level of federal stimulus related to covid puerto rico still has a significant amount of hurricane recovery funds that have yet to be disbursed and which now have begun to flow at a faster pace we expect that the combined impact of these factors along with the continued progress on the resolution of puerto ricos fiscal issues should generate considerable economic activity in many sectors for the coming years and we are wellpositioned to benefit from such activity we are optimistic about the economic outlook yet cognizant of the possible challenges to the environment resulting from the war in ukraine inflation and the ongoing health situation i am thankful to our entire team who have continued to perform at a high level and deliver results under a myriad of changing conditions we continue investing in our people and in january increased the minimum wage pay to our employees across all our geographies our employees are populars greatest source of strength we are ready now to answer your questions popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you ignacio operator instructions our first question comes from brock vandervliet of ubs brock your line is open please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for the question good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc i may have just missed that but constantly hunting for economic and employment data in particular about the island could you review the actual number that youre citing in terms of the employment improvement ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah the unemployment rate was and the participation rate i didnt say it specifically but its 44and changepercent an increase about 2andchangepercent from our prior reading brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it and in terms of the government deposits i guess just two questions one you had framed out the impact of that runoff as i believe to basis points of nim benefit for every billion is that still reasonable and should we see that in  and i guess secondly what would drive that range in terms of ph to basis points down to the low or sticking it at basis points carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah the range still applies brock that we mentioned earlier whats going the drive the change in that the balances within that range is normal operational activity of the government which means that for the second quarter since for example they get all the tax receipts in the second quarter we should end up in the higher end of that range normally during the rest of the year the government spends money and they have less inflows so the balance should come down during the rest of the year they will have now for the first time in five years six years debt payment at the beginning of july that is new as well popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 so our best guess right now is that it should go should be higher end of our range in the second quarter and then come down after that the thing that may that affects that balance in ways that is very hard for us to predict is the arrival of some federal funds so sometimes we get surprised in the upside when a particular program is triggered and a big slug of federal funds arrive but normal flow of business should be around the highest at this point in the year and should gravitate down from here brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks ill go back to the queue operator thank you brock our next question comes from timur braziler of wells fargo please go ahead timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc starting on the loan growth two quarters in a row of positive net growth i heard your comment that this is coming sooner than what you had been expecting which was for kind of net growth in the back end of the year im guessing how does the loan growth outlook change if at all given these last few quarters should we expect accelerating growth as some of the stimulus money begins to find its way into the economy as some of this existing growth in the fourth and the first quarter here kind of preemptive in anticipation for increased economic activity and rolls off i guess how do you think about loan growth going from the year with these two good quarters in your pocket now ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah i think that the definitely loan growth has a lot to do with confidence in the economy and i think theres a lot of confidence in the economy right now especially in the larger players so a lot of the loan growth we saw in the larger commercial loans both in the us and in puerto rico so its hard to predict because those loans are lumpy but we definitely have not seen any deceleration of the interest from our clients theres a lot of activity going on theres a lot of people looking at different possibilities acquisitions investment so its a bit lumpy because these loans are large but we certainly dont see any deceleration of the loan demand at this point timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just looking at the swing in aoci could you just maybe talk through some of the internal discussions about potentially having moved some of the portfolio into a heldtomaturity status during the quarter and then the duration you said is four years its a pretty straight line should we assume about a quarter of the popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 portfolio runs off annually and kind of extrapolate that on a quarterly basis or is there some difference in the pace of cash flow on that book carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc there was no substantive discussions of us moving the portfolio to heldtomaturity during the quarter we have historically held the portfolio in available for sale so no significant expected change there the portfolio maturities are pretty wellbalanced as we move forward so and when we add to the portfolio as well timur we tend to layer in all our future maturities a little bit as opposed to add a big chunk in any given maturity so we have a quite balanced portfolio your guess of a quarter of it every year juan p will comment on juan juan pablo pérez hanley a treasurer popular inc yes this is juan pablo the treasurer in terms of maturity structure id say around to mature within the next three years and then another kind of between years three and five so again as carlos mentioned the portfolio has laddered out all the way out to six or seven years but again the bulk of the exposures are kind of like in the belly of the curve timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc understood thank you ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you operator thank you timur our next question comes from brett rabatin of hovde group please go ahead brett brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning everyone ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning brett carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 wanted to ask about fee income and mortgage specifically it seemed like the msr mark didnt that rates given where rates have moved would have been more significant can you maybe talk about mortgage the msr and i think if i heard you correctly million to million kind of guidance for quarterly fee income it seemed like youve got some movement there and other with the equity piece so it would seem like there could be some pressure to lower into that but i want to make sure i understood how youre thinking about the guidance for fee income as well carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah the guidance for fee income is unchanged as you know theres a lot of moving parts that add up to that number of million to million and any given quarter things go come up and down one of the reasons we keep the guidance at the aggregate level is that a lot of those things that happen tend to cancel out from quarter to quarter so you end up with similar levels even though specific lines may be a lot more volatile we still feel comfortable that this is the correct range moving forward in this environment now when the transaction with evertec closes we will make some adjustments to that range yes but we that hasnt happened yet so we havent made any adjustments yet there will be some adjustments to the rate moving forward brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats helpful and any thoughts on the msr and mortgage overall carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah on mortgage i mean we are seeing trends are not dissimilar from everybody else is seeing in the country when rates go up the refi rate goes down so we still have a very healthy housing market in puerto rico but one of the challenges is finding a house to buy theres very little offer of units in the island and that makes the new market somewhat challenging so lower there will be we expect to have as we did in the first quarter lower volumes than last quarter as a result well be securitizing less loans and the fees from that will be lower the msr you know my view on the msr brett the msr does what the msr does and theres the the effect of rates indiscernible the effect of extension on it so different things will affect at any point in time so i take that more as a fact than as a something that we try to forecast or hedge brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay fair enough and then the other thing i really wanted to talk about was ive been looking at all the data economically and its been very strong and you point out some of the numbers on the call so far this quarter so far this year and i mean this looks really to me like this is going to be the first year where puerto rico in many many years has had its going to have lowsingle digit positive gnp growth and it doesnt seem to be anything underlying that even despite higher energy prices potentially impacting retail spending et cetera employment continues to be stronger yet it doesnt sound like you guys are taking a very bullish view on the economy more of a waitandsee or cautious approach can you give me any color around that and how youre viewing the year and if its just that everybody is sort of nervous about the yield curve implications et cetera global stuff or maybe you can provide a little color on that ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 i dont like i mean maybe we didnt express it clearly but i think were very optimistic about where the economy is i mean the puerto rico economy today is as good as anyone has seen it for a long time and again to me the most important one the most important is employment and really its we have more people employed today with a lower population than we had a decade ago so i think the biggest headwind to the economy that were concerned about is external to puerto rico its not internal its what happens in the ukraine and what that does to inflation and supply chain but really i think the puerto rico economy as you said is positioned to grow more solid than it has in a long time and right now the consumer remains healthy our customers have a lot of liquidity really the biggest problem we have is as like many people is hiring across the board and puerto rico is staffing people for the growth but i think were very optimistic about the puerto rico economy i think there are some legitimate concerns about external factors ukraine inflation logistics all that kind of stuff but in terms of puerto rico were very optimistic carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc brett our average retail client balance is up from where it was prepandemic so the consumer seems to be still a very strong position do keep in mind that puerto rico will benefit from an extended application of the federal child tax credit and that should add some additional liquidity to the market starting this month so there is still positives that keep giving us a tailwinds and we are positive on that brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay any i think you mentioned on healthcare any thoughts on supreme court decision to disallow the several hundred thousand people with the medicare benefits this year ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well its very disappointing keep in mind though that we didnt have that benefit until very recently when the appellate court in fact i dont know they never implemented so its not a benefit that we lost its that we hadnt lost its a benefit that obviously would have been very important to us its disappointing were hopeful that the administration will be able in the next two years that they have left or at least before the midterms before the congress changes get some of those benefits through legislation but again remember that is not something we hadnt lost that is something that the courts the congress had never given us and the courts the lower courts ruled that it was unconstitutional to discriminate against puerto rico and the supreme court reversed that we have had a lot of additional benefits though the child tax credit which is something puerto rico only participated in marginally that has been a very large benefit to puerto rico so i think thats very important and i think that has helped households in puerto rico deal a little bit with the inflationary pressures its a lot of money visàvis the average annual salary in puerto rico the child tax credit again there is a lot of money out there i mean stimulus is not our problem our problem is more to get it out as estimates of the hurricane recovery fund is more than billion yet to be spent there is different legislation for covid relief some estimates have about billion left to be spent we have the infrastructure bill that had about billion in the next five years another billion after that so theres a lot of money out there yet to be spent how much will be spent i dont know this is more the supplemental medicare is more a human rights issue than i think an economic impact issue popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay i appreciate all the color operator thank you brett our next question comes from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets please go ahead gerard your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning ignacio and good morning carlos ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc carlos you mentioned in your prepared remarks that at the end of march you indicated that a 25basispoint increase in fed fund rates would lead to about a million to million increase in net interest income as part of that comment if the fed raises fed funds rates basis points lets say next month and possibly a second time can you share with us what that would do is it an automatic double to that number or is it not that linear and then second as you look out through the remainder of the year and if the forward curve is accurate i assume the million to million for every basis points is not linear and because the deposit betas and other things that benefit might diminish a bit carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah i think its in the short term you can assume that its reasonably linear it will not necessarily be as you move later on the year in part because there may be other changes in the balance sheet as well that may adjust it but in the shortterm if next month is basis points instead of basis points it should be something in the ballpark of twice the range we gave yes but if you try to think about how that may affect the rate change in september or in october that number may be somewhat different but well update this commentary in every webcast that youll get an updated version gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then you were talking earlier about the investment securities portfolio and the duration i know in the average balance sheet you give the yield for both money markets in trading and investment securities popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 together i think it was basis points what is the yield in the investment securities portfolio today and what are you now seeing as you invest money into that portfolio whats the new rate that youre receiving carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah ill have juan pablo answer that one juan pablo pérez hanley a treasurer popular inc yeah right now the portfolio the bond portfolio excluding the cash is around basis points you know at the margin you got to think that right now depending on where youre purchasing stuffs anywhere above between basis points and basis points is where marginal funds are being deployed at this point in time gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then finally i juan pablo pérez hanley a treasurer popular inc just to indiscernible the other thing and that is tax exempt for us so the actual aftertax yield is quite higher than that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it you guys talked about the growth in commercial lending in the quarter and can you give us a little further color is it ci lending commercial and industrial lending is it commercial real estate mortgages that youre seeing the growth in and is it primarily in on the island or is it here in the mainland ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc i think we saw that in both markets i dont know lidio can put some more color on it but we saw strong lending in hospitality sector in the multifamily sector in the us so really really across the board we had construction lending was up also so it was really across the board in both geographies i dont know lidio lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc its pretty balanced too gerard commercial growth in puerto rico was about basis points and in the states was basis points so its actually pretty balanced last quarter it was much more heavily weighted to the popular bank than puerto rico but this quarter was a lot more balanced gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just finally in the commercial mortgage portion with the 10year backing up the way it did in the month of march was there any change in what your guys on the front line are seeing meaning commercial real estate mortgage folks are not looking to do as much activity right now or is that no it hasnt really affected them popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc we havent seen any significant change so far gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great thank you ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thanks operator thank you gerard operator instructions our next question comes from alex twerdahl of piper sandler alex your line is open please go ahead alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co thank you good morning all ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc good morning alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co a couple of questions here so with the new range on the government deposits the billion to billion does that change and with obviously this bankruptcy kind of now in the rearview mirror does that change your willingness to actually activate some of those deposits i know that youre kind of sitting on a big chunk of them for a long time kind of unsure what was going to flow out but now that we have a little bit more clarity could you take some of that billion of cash on the balance sheet and maybe at least invest a little bit more in the securities portfolio carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc well we have been adding to securities portfolio every one of the last three or four quarters i think alex so weve been doing some of that you are correct that some of the uncertainty about forwardlooking balances has now gone away so we will continue to look at our cash position and investment opportunities the investment popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 opportunities are obviously a lot more attractive now than they were a few quarters ago so our willingness to extend this is probably getting better because we find them more attractive now so this is where our alco committee does on a weekly basis so we will definitely continue to extend and with less uncertainty on our balance sheet and better investment opportunities well consider extending more than we have in the last few quarters on average alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co have you done any so far during the second quarter that you can share with us carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc i dont recall on the second quarter alex but you should assume that we will do some in the second quarter as well alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then when we talk about loan growth and we talk about the hurricane money that still is has kind of been slow to come to the island you can kind of really parse out from some of the programs big chunks of money theyve been allocated to things like affordable housing and just some of the r3 program and the investment portfolio for growth and if you look at the numbers that are publicly available and you just you see the projections have been pretty strong going forward but a lot of that money is really yet to be spent in the past youve talked about kind of planning and permitting it was maybe last year and now this year youre starting to see a little bit of commercial growth are you seeing any of that related to some of these hud programs and if not do you think that there is do you have a line of sight onto sort of when some of those programs might come online ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc its hard to get a line of sight because of a lot of internal negotiations and processing going on between indiscernible in the federal government we are starting to see it youre right theyre starting to come out slower than we hope i mean they just announced the first recovery project for the aqueduct and sewer authority a billion project it was finally built there is a lot of proposals i think the last time i read luma and the power authority have projects in front of fema to be approved so its going to the project i think the housing with the cdbg funds is moving a little bit faster they have disbursed the money but again its we cant hide the fact it is slower than we would have hoped the one thing that i do think the political realities are that as the biden administration enters their halfway mark i think theres going to be real pressure on the administration to get more money out because obviously they were very critical of the way the trump administration handled the funding for puerto rico and really the first two years it really hasnt dramatically increased that much so i think just the timing theyre processing it further along a lot of work has been done i think therell be political pressure on the federal government to show some results especially they were highly critical of the trump administration popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 they should make some progress now thats the positive side a little bit on the negative side is all the all these logistical challenges and inflationary challenges complicate the process of buying the stuff for projects some of these specialized equipment i read somewhere it could take two to three years for deliveries so the logistical challenges are real that said i mean the money is starting to flow not as fast as we want but again the economy is doing very well sort of without that big inflow so keeping a little bit of that reserve is not necessarily a bad thing carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc as an example the government announced today that they are trying to negotiate with federal authorities for them to allow the equipment that is involved in some of the projects that will be built in to rebuild the electrical sector to be purchased ahead of the final granting of the contracts because the way it is now you actually have to wait for the contract to be granted to order the equipment as ignacio said that equipment may have a lead time normally of to months maybe and nowadays maybe two years so trying to get ahead of some of that so thats the kind of logistical discussions that are going on hopefully they will be resolved positively so we can get more of those projects going quicker alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co and theoretically if someone wanted to purchase a big piece of equipment with the two years ahead of when a contract might be executed is that something that they would need a bank loan to help facilitate that purchase ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well it depends who youre talking about again the equipment that will be the lets say like the power stations thats going to be bought by luma or the power authority with federal funds however a lot of the work will be done by private contractors and those private contractors will have to buy trucks and equipment they use to install the stuff now the infrastructure itself is going to be funded by federal funds but again much of the work will be done by private contractors who will have to buy equipment and that kind of thing alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co thats helpful just a couple of sort of followup questions the basis points equal million to million per quarter kind of whats the difference between that million and the million is it really liquidity from the government that defines those two kind of ends carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah largely the difference between two ends was billion sic million in balances versus what we thought was million which is now looks like more like million to million as we mentioned so that is the biggest delta theres some other things that will swing it but that is the biggest delta yes alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 okay so if its million then youre probably looking at around million per rate per quarter and that just correct me if im wrong thats just the short end right that makes no assumptions on the long end of the curve carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc that is correct and as i mentioned earlier it is fairly lineal in the very short term but as we get out of quarter two that number will probably change okay alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you and then on the expense guide which is unchanged from last quarter is that reflective of the renegotiation of the evertec contract carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc now the expense guide it does not include that yet because that transaction has not closed once that transaction closes alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc we will update our guidance to reflect any changes that are necessary alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co and that takes the cpi escalator from indiscernible for this year right so that could have some decent savings in the back half of this year is that am i thinking about that correctly carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc assuming that everything close as we are assuming right now that will provide some savings in the back end of the year yes alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then how should we think about the million of buyback authorization that you left out of the asr can you give us some thoughts on how we should be thinking about how that will be utilized over the remainder of the year carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 we are still going through that analysis and making decisions on it we are considering this together with our expressed intent to redeploy some of the gains from evertec so the size and timing will depend on a number of things so we are still working through that we havent made any decisions alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just to clarify the capital ratio that really matters for you guys in your mind is the common equity tier and when we see the leverage ratio or even the tangible common equity ratio kind of decline as a result of the size of the balance sheet or if things like the aoci hit does that have any is that something you guys pay attention to at all when youre thinking about capital actions carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc i mean remember the aoci has no effect on our regulatory ratios so that didnt change the regulatory ratios we continue to have very healthy regulatory ratios and at this point in time we have no reason to think that we would change the way we look at capital return alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay great thanks for taking my questions carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you operator thank you alex we have a question from kelly motta of kbw please go ahead kelly kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi thank you so much for the question just carrying on the topic of the buyback remaining when you announced evertec you said you would be repurchasing kind of the post day one gains on the remaining sales of evertec shares is that incremental on top of the million you already committed or is that are they kind of one and the same carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc no that would be incremental yes kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you for the clarification and then i guess with credit i mean things have you had another negative provisioned things have continued to strengthen and get better and indiscernible qualitative reserve as we kind of look out net chargeoffs have been really almost negligible have you guys considered at all what a normalized chargeoff ratio looks like now on a goforward basis given all the relief money that is yet to be disbursed and kind of thoughts around that thanks popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc kelly thats i would say a difficult question to answer but i will say that prior to the pandemic and all the money that is coming into puerto rico the normal range of chargeoff for the corporation was between basis points to basis points i mean it seems like the new normal or in the short to medium term would be a little bit lower than that range so thats what we view of the part of the new normal kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right thank you thats helpful and then maybe just the last one for me i really appreciate all the color around asset sensitivity just wondering on kind of what youre baking in for your expectations for deposit betas do you expect it to follow a similar cadence as the last time around or given the fact that you guys all have so much liquidity do you think youll be a perform a bit better and that goes into that nii outlook for each basis points thanks carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah remember that we have two pieces to our deposit beta the deposit beta in the us bank and deposit beta in the puerto rico bank the deposit beta in the us bank is much looks a lot more like any other billion bank in the eastern shore of the united states so its closer to changing market rates in the case of puerto rico historically deposit betas have been lower in both directions than they have been in the mainland youre correct that theres a lot of liquidity so just thinking that they will look like last time is not unrealistic now what we do not know kelly is especially how clients are going to react to a very fast increasing rate especially commercial clients are the most sensitive and the most attentive to that so if commercial clients start looking at opportunities to invest reinvest the cash in a different way then that could affect the beta negatively but as a starting point its not unreasonable to think that they will look like last time kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks thats really helpful and just a small followup for me do you have a sense of or just like approximate breakout of to your deposit base of retail versus commercial carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah give me a second and we will well give you that question sic answer hold on okay indiscernible puerto rico retail is billion about of the billion almost billion that we have excluding public deposits okay so that kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 and the sorry the us we have the us too the us is no no sorry i dont have the us on my hand on the right handedly kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats fine carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc we can check on the us and get back to you on that kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you so much appreciate all the time today thank you carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thanks kelly operator thank you kelly we have a followup question from brock vandervliet of ubs please go ahead brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc oh thanks just a followup to that credit string of questions is there any just trying to dimension where the reserve could go is there any reason to expect given this tailwind that its not returning to to as a percentage of loans over time carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc im not sure what you mean returning to to again its also a difficult question to answer as you know under cecl another important factor is the economic forecast so when you look at the trend it seems that everything else being equal that were seeing lower releases of reserves on a monthtomonth basis so we are sort of like getting close to a plateau but then you have the factor related to the economic forecast if that changes then there could be significant impact to the reserves brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay nothing new there on nonaccruals a lot of that i think is resi mortgage is there some guidance where we should expect just an everpresent large component of resi mortgage just because of the way the market is on the island im just trying to dimension the potential increases ahead in nonperformers carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 i mean that have always been the case of our business in puerto rico npls have mostly and largely been residential mortgage loans and that is in part due to the fact that the foreclosure process in puerto rico takes very very long so i would expect going forward that that will continue to be the case brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay but the commercial could trend lower okay all right thank you ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you operator thank you brock we currently have no further questions so i will hand back to popular ceo ignacio for any closing remarks ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thanks again for joining us and for your questions we look forward to update you on
