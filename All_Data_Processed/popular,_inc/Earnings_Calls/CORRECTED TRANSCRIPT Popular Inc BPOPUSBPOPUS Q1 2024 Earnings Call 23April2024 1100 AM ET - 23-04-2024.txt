totaled million which includes the impact of an additional accrual for the fdic special assessment and a tax expense related to prior intercompany distribution excluding these items net income would have been million compared to adjusted net income of million in the previous quarter the results in the first quarter were driven by higher net interest income and a lower provision for credit losses offset in part by lower noninterest income and a slightly higher operating expenses our ending loan balances increased by million during the quarter with large commercial payoffs impacting both banks our average loan balances however increased by million driven by a substantial amount of loan activity toward the end of the fourth quarter bppr generated loan growth of million driven by growth in mortgage and auto offset in part by decreases in personal and commercial loans popular bank saw a million decrease in loan balances driven by commercial loan payoffs that offset growth in construction loans deposit balances increased by approximately million driven primarily by a higher level of retail demand deposits in bppr which increased by million offset somewhat by lower puerto rico public deposits our net interest margin increased by basis points to mainly driven by higher average loan balances and the repricing of loans and securities in a higher interest rate environment this was partially offset by higher deposit costs noninterest income remained solid at million excluding the additional fdic assessment and the expenses associated with the prior period tax expense operating expenses increased by million credit quality trends remained generally favorable with slightly lower npls and delinquencies we have continued to see credit normalization in the puerto rico unsecured consumer segments which began in the second half of last year and we continue to be attentive to the evolving credit landscape tangible book value per share increased by as our quarterly net income was offset in part by dividends and an increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio please turn to slide last year we crossed a significant milestone in puerto rico and now serve more than million unique customers we believe that there continues to be opportunity to deliver more value and services to our clients and deepen those relationships for the past two years we have been engaged in a companywide transformation and we are confident that these efforts will help us capitalize upon that opportunity consumer spending remained healthy combined credit and debit card sales increased by compared to the first quarter of our auto loan and lease balances increased by million compared to the fourth quarter as demand for new cars continued to be strong in puerto rico mortgage loan balances at bppr increased by million in the first quarter driven primarily by home purchase activity and our strategy to retain fha loans in portfolio the puerto rico economy performed well during the quarter business activity is solid as reflected in the positive trends in total employment and other economic data the tourism and hospitality sector continues to be a source of strength for the local economy passenger traffic at the san juan international airport increased by in the popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 first quarter compared to the first quarter of additionally in march the hotel occupancy rate increased to from in march of the average daily rate and revpar increased by and respectively compared to the same month a year ago there are a significant amount of committed federal funds that have yet to be disbursed the pace of disbursement of these funds has accelerated and we anticipate that they will support economic activity for several years we are encouraged by the performance of the puerto rico economy we remain optimistic about the future of our primary market and are wellpositioned to support our clients during in the coming years in short we are pleased with the results for the quarter particularly in puerto rico where continued loan growth and the strength of our deposit base helped contribute to our increase in net interest income and support our optimistic outlook for the balance of the year on that note ill now turn the call over to jorge for more details on our financial results jorge j garc√≠a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc thank you ignacio and thank you all for joining the call today as ignacio stated in his remarks we reported net income of million in the first quarter excluding the effect of the fdic assessment and the tax expenses related to prior period intercompany distributions adjusted net income was million million lower than the prior quarters adjusted results although the quarter had some noise because of these two items we are pleased with the core results particularly the nii growth and the expansion of the nim net interest income increased by million in the quarter our net interest margin increased by basis points on a gaap basis and basis points on a tax equivalent basis driven by higher average loan balances and the repricing of loans and securities we should continue to see nim expansion throughout the rest of consistent with our previous guidance we expect our nii to increase by approximately to from levels loan growth this quarter was lower than recent trends driven by the early repayment of two large loans totaling around million and decreased loan demand in the us mainland the underlying economic activity in puerto rico remains strong and as such we continue to expect loan growth of to in noninterest income was million a decrease of million from  driven by lower contingent commissions in our insurance business which are usually recognized in the second and fourth quarter of each year we continue to expect noninterest income to be approximately million to million per quarter in we were also pleased to see stable credit metrics and the early benefits of changes we implemented to address the credit losses that arose late last year in our consumer loan portfolio the provision for credit losses was million compared to million in the fourth quarter total operating expenses were million including the additional expense of million related to the fdic special assessment and million in expenses related to the late payment of taxes from prior period intercompany distributions excluding these two items operating expenses were million an increase of million from q4s adjusted operating expenses other significant expense variances in the quarter were higher personnel costs by million mainly due to annual incentive awards and payroll taxes which are traditionally higher during the first quarter of the year and popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 higher credit card processing expenses by million mainly due to lower volume driven rebates in the first quarter these expenses were offset in part by a decrease in professional fees by million mainly related to regulatory consulting fees and other advisory expenses business promotion expenses were also lower as these are typically higher in the fourth quarter notwithstanding the impact of the incremental fdic expense and expenses related to the tax liabilities from their prior period distributions we continue to expect annual expenses in the range of billion to billion for our effective tax rate for the quarter was due mainly to having recorded million in income tax expense related to prior period intercompany dividends from our us subsidiary to the puerto rico bank holding company these dividends are subject to a federal tax withholding and ordinary income tax in puerto rico that we failed to pay for several years therefore these results reflect the cumulative effect of correcting this oversight excluding the impact of the fdic special assessment and their prior period tax matter the effective tax rate would have been this adjusted effective tax rate in  also reflects approximately million in income tax expenses arising from a million distribution from the us sub completing during this quarter we do not anticipate the tax treatment of us sourced dividends to the bank holding companies to impact liquidity or future capital action on a gaap basis we now expect the effective tax rate for the year to be in a range of to this includes the impact of the million in income tax expense related to the prior period distribution please turn to slide net interest margin increased by basis points on a taxable equivalent basis nim was an increase of basis points the increase was driven by higher loan yields and average balances across most lending categories as well as higher yields in our investment portfolio this was partially offset by higher interest expense on deposits due to increased average balance of public deposits at bppr and high cost online deposits at popular bank excluding puerto rico deposits consolidated customer deposit balances increased by roughly million primarily in retail accounts at the end of the first quarter puerto rico public deposits were billion down slightly compared to  and at the upper end of our guidance range for the rest of we expect public deposits to be in the range of billion to billion as usual normal seasonality should result in public deposit balances trending higher and peaking in  mostly related to tax receipts our interest rate sensitivity remains relatively neutral a higher for a longer rate environment should not have a significant impact on our nii forecast for except to the extent that such an environment increases pressure on deposit pricing particularly in our us operations due to changes in client or competitor behavior please turn to slide deposit betas in the current tightening cycle are above the prior cycle we have seen a total cumulative deposit beta of to date driven by public deposits in puerto rico and online deposits in the us the rate of increase in deposit costs for the corporation continued to slow down in the quarter in bppr total deposit costs increased by basis points compared to an increase of basis points in  led by higher average balances of public deposits the cost of public deposits decreased by basis point at popular bank deposit costs increased by basis points compared to an increase of basis points in  driven by the deposits gathered primarily through our online channel please turn to slide we continue to target a sustainable return on tangible common equity by the end of 2025regulatory capital levels remain strong our cet1 ratio of increased by basis points from  tangible book value per share at the quarter end was an increase of per share from  our long term outlook on capital return has not changed over time we expect our regulatory capital ratios to gravitate popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 towards the levels of our mainland peers plus a buffer driven by our geographic concentration in puerto rico we continue working towards announcing new capital actions in the second half of the size and nature of any future capital actions will depend on the outlook of the interest rate environment including the impact on our tce ratio with that i turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc thank you jorge and good morning credit quality metrics were stable from the fourth quarter as trends remained consistent with recent performance the corporations mortgage and commercial portfolios continue to reflect credit metrics significantly below prepandemic levels but credit quality metrics continue to normalize for puerto ricos unsecured personal loans credit cards and auto and lease finance loans we continue to closely monitor changes in the macroeconomic environment and on borrower performance given higher rates higher interest rates and inflationary pressure i have made changes to underwriting criteria to decrease exposure to higher risk segments we believe that the improvements over recent years in risk management practices and the risk profile of the corporation loans portfolios positions popular to continue to operate successfully under the current environment turning to slide number nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans decreased slightly driven by the puerto rico region npls in puerto rico decreased by million reflecting improvements in most loan categories npls in the us increased by million related to higher mortgage npls by million impacted by a single loan and higher commercial npls by million inflows of npls increased by million driven by the previously mentioned increasing npls in the us mortgage and commercial portfolios in puerto rico total inflows decreased by million driven by million relationships that enter npl in the fourth quarter of the ratio of npl to total loans held in portfolio remained flat at turning to slide number net chargeoff amounted to million or annualized basis points of average loans heldin portfolio compared to million or basis points in the prior quarter the increase in net charge off was driven by a million chargeoff related to a previously reserved loan excluding this the chargeoffs were flat in puerto rico net chargeoffs increased by million mainly driven by higher commercial and consumer net chargeoffs net chargeoffs in the us were flat quarteroverquarter we continue to expect net chargeoffs for the full year to be between basis points to basis points due to the ongoing credit normalization and general economic environment please turn to slide number the allowance for credit losses increased by million to million in puerto rico the acl increased by million driven by the consumer portfolio due to changes in credit quality in the us the acl increased by million driven by higher commercial loan reserves due to rating migration the corporation ratio of acl to loans heldin portfolio remained flat at while the ratio of acl to npls stood at compared to in the previous quarter the provision for credit losses was million compared to million in the prior quarter in puerto rico the provision was million compared to million while in the us the provision was million versus million to summarize credit quality remained stable during the first quarter consistent with recent performance we are attentive to the evolving environment but remain encouraged by the performance of our loan book with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you lidio and jorge for your updates popular started off with a solid first quarter building on the positive momentum seen in our results are driven

commitment to serve our customers and contribute to populars success we are now ready to answer your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question today comes from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets your line is open please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi ignacio and jorge ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning jorge j garc√≠a a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys give us an update on the timeline on deciding about a share repurchase program obviously youre very well capitalized the outlook this year is rather strong better than many of your peers in terms of your popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 economic growth and net income growth and so if you could just update us what youre thinking in terms of possibly announcing a share buyback program in the next months to months ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well i think were going to reiterate what we said were working hard we anticipate that we will be making an announcement about our plans and thatll be in the second half of the year i really we wouldnt want to pinpoint it too much in terms of specific months or whatnot but we are rest assured we know people want to hear from us and were working hard to make some kind of announcement gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and i guess as a followup just for that question are because your capital levels i know you havent given us a specific cet1 ratio that you want to manage to but assuming youre comfortable to say that your current levels are more than sufficient would you be willing or would you consider a program that would actually give back more capital to shareholders in dividends and buybacks that would exceed a current period of earnings so that the combined ratio if you will would exceed jorge j garc√≠a a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc gerard this is jorge i mean i think at this stage as we said in the prepared remarks the level of any new capital actions that we announce will depend on a lot of factors as ignacio said we know this is important to our shareholders we have that in mind and i guess id say lets get started with an announcement sometime in the second half and then well see where we go from there but its important that we set the stage we would expect capital actions to be gradual over time this is not going to be a step function or we see a huge decrease or something like that it will be over time gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it and then just as a final question when you guys look at the next two years to three years whats the optimal mix of money market and investment securities as a percentage of assets relative to loans do you are you comfortable keeping it in the to range or would it over time maybe gradually come down further ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah ill let jorge add to that but i think its going to depend on the level of public funds right so to the extent that the gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc right ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 public funds go down we would expect that the investment securities go down if you ask me i always prefer more loans to investment securities but i think its going to depend on the its going to be mostly dependent on the level of public funds if they go down you can expect the percentage of investment securities to go down also gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator our next question today comes from timur braziler of wells fargo please go ahead your line is open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning jorge j garc√≠a a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc good morning timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc looking at just the nii performance in the first quarter and then your unchanged guidance for the year annualizing first quarter performance gets you to the upper end of the guidance you get a seasonally strong quarter for deposits in loan growth is going to pick up kind of versus where first quarter came in is it safe to say that youre kind of targeting closer to the upper end of the guidance i guess what would need to take place for you to come in closer to the lower end of your guidance at this point jorge j garc√≠a a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc ill reiterate we reaffirm the guidance to we give a range for a reason timur in terms of the risk to the guidance i think we talked about it a little bit on the prepared remarks i think the deposit competitive deposit activity particularly in our us operations if a higher for a longer environment or another bank failure creates a lot of pressure for liquidity and competition those are the kinds of things that would have would impact that guidance timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess just speaking to deposits more specifically with public funds being at billion in being seasonally high are those expected to go higher and i guess in that same line of questioning maybe the competition for those deposits is a little bit more on the island are you anticipating having to pay up to get your fair share of kind of that seasonal deposit growth in the second quarter popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc no the no the public deposits generally have a formula that we abide by so its just really going to depend on we noted before its a formula based on shortterm rates so thats not going to depend on the competitive pressures the banks in puerto rico in terms of the nonpublic deposits would continue to have very healthy loan todeposit ratio perhaps too healthy so i dont see that kind of competitive environment changing in the short run timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just last for me looking at the unsecured consumer credit and maybe some of these other consumer categories were hearing in the us from some of the consumer companies ph that just see lot of activity during the pandemic now seasoning youre seeing kind of a commensurate increase in delinquency rates with the expectations for that to actually peak and then move lower throughout the course of the year should we expect a similar dynamic in puerto rico or maybe as you get through some of the excess capacity that was took on during covid as that rolls off could we actually see some of these consumer delinquency rates to decline as some of the underwriting criteria kind of kicks in lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc i think a couple of things yes as we mentioned in the prepared remarks during the first quarter we saw a stability of our actually a decrease in some of the delinquencies in some of the consumer portfolios which would help us to believe that maybe were close to reaching a peak in addition to that as you mentioned we made significant changes in the fourth quarter to some of our underwriting criteria and those just being short dated or short duration portfolios will tend to have an impact in the short term so yes we expect that well see a peak soon timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator our next question comes from brett rabatin from hovde group please go ahead your line is open brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning everybody i had a question around the multifamily us portfolio of billion which is i guess of the total portfolio so its not huge but i didnt understand the comment on slide that says no exposure to rent control buildings but then the next bullet says rent stabilized units represent less than of the total units in the portfolio can you explain the rent control piece of the multifamily portfolio and then obviously multifamily is something folks are thinking about the classifieds are still low for you guys but they did increase ph one quarter just want to get a better understanding of the book lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc i think with multifamily in new york there are different levels obviously there are marketrate apartments there are rent stabilized apartments which allow for certain increases in rent provided by on a yearly basis i think by popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 the state government and then there are rent controlled in which the rents basically are fixed for a period of time so were saying that we have no exposure to rent control apartments we have exposure to rent stabilized apartment brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay and then do you just generally what do you expect from that portfolio from here as you look at it in terms of where migration might occur classified criticized in that book lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc i dont think we would provide that level of detail in or that level of guidance in any of our portfolio what i would say that as we put in page i think you referenced page there are the biggest risk when you look at multifamily the level of rent control rent stabilization and then the risk of repricing of the portfolio going forward as we mentioned in that slide we only have about million of multifamily loans repricing in that have more than stabilized unit in the apartments so we feel comfortable and i think is reflected in the ratings of our portfolio brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thanks lidio and then wanted to ask back on capital when i look at slide i think its the investment portfolio its slide when i go back to the 10k and look at the fair value marks on securities portfolio if you look at the duration on slide its two years but then if you look at the 10k theres a pretty good ph slog thats i call it a barbell strategy can you guys talk about any willingness to maybe restructure the longer piece of the securities portfolio that at yearend was about billion of billion in total aoci jorge j garc√≠a a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc brett one thing i think in the 10k the mbs portfolio is structured based on original maturity it doesnt have a prepayment factor which you would see in the maturity profile that you have on slide so i think thats a difference between the way we report for sec requirements versus this slide so in terms of the maturity curve i would look at slide when you see particularly on the treasuries you see a ladder strategy where were seeing quarterly maturities of somewhere around million when you add prepayment maturities on mbss of around million a quarter you really are repricing about billion a quarter we expect about of our unrealized loss at the end of this quarter to have been accreted back to tangible book value by the end of assuming no changes in the rate scenario of course so we believe that given our profile and the amount of the unrealized loss thats just going to naturally accrete back to tangible book value a trade where we realize a loss doesnt make sense essentially any trade with a similar duration it has no economic value to our shareholders and were just trading capital a big chunk of capital for eps and at this stage we dont believe that thats a good trade brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats really helpful and if i could sneak in one last one on the unchanged nii guidance and relative to the loan growth guidance is it fair to assume the balance sheet is very flat for the year popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 jorge j garc√≠a a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc i mean what would drive growth in the balance sheet would be growth in deposits as we would probably given the amount of liquidity and securities so i would say that when you look at the nii guidance it is really driven by the repricing of those investment portfolios that are maturing every quarter you have the repricing of loans in a higherrate environment i mean just to run in place we have to generate a lot of new loans every quarter so that there is a lift from that if public deposits come down given our range where we are at the top end of the range that will reduce the balance sheet so i mean i dont we dont give guidance in terms of indiscernible balance sheet is going to be but there are a lot of levers there that could impact that projection brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats great thanks for all the color operator our next question comes from ben gerlinger of citi your line is open please go ahead benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hey good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning jorge j garc√≠a a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc good morning benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc just curious in terms of the chargeoff guidance i mean the basis points to basis points is a pretty wide range i guess at the beginning of the year there was quite a bit of the range of outcomes is pretty wide it seems like not only things are slowing down theyre showing clear plateauing effect is it fair to think that the basis points is a bit draconian at this level lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc i mean were providing the guidance that and we updated the guidance to basis points to basis points i think youre right in a sense that as we move along the year there can be more confidence in terms of the guidance but as of today were sticking with the basis points to basis points benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you and then from an expense perspective i know you gave the range for this year when you think about next year or even are there any efficiency opportunities that you might see not necessarily in but just popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 thinking high level im just trying to look i know you dont want to give guidance for or at this point but just thinking from an operational perspective is there any way or any opportunities to kind of just tighten up the expense base i think youre doing a great job now im just kind of curious how you get even better from here jorge j garc√≠a a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc i mean i think as you said we dont want to give guidance for ph fair enough but were doing a lot of efforts in the transformation that help us to go towards that rotce guidance most of that effort we believe is top line driven so well be creating operational efficiencies and while we always are focused on managing cost and trying to make sure we slow down the acceleration of expenses i would not expect a driver that would decrease our expense base significantly i would see more of an opportunity to create more efficiency operational efficiency from higher revenues and slowing down the growth of expenses benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats helpful color i appreciate it operator the next question comes from jared shaw of barclays your line is open jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning maybe looking at the loan growth in light of the weaker endofperiod balances this quarter from some of those payoffs what gives you confidence in the pipeline here do you feel just that were we should see some ci and cre growth accelerate to keep that range stable here ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well this is ignacio in terms of puerto rico i mean the were still optimistic about the economic conditions which after all thats whats going to end up in loan growth so the economy seems going strong i mean were seeing a lot of interest from clients and different deals were seeing investors asking around so we dont give a number on the pipeline but given the environment is strong so i would expect the commercial loan growth will pick up i would expect construction will pick up the number of construction projects that weve signed up but havent really disbursed any funds indiscernible remain strong and i would consider that will remain strong so i think in puerto rico youre going to see indiscernible commercial will go up and i think auto will remain strong were building up our mortgage loan our strategy of holding mortgages in portfolio that should be relatively steady in the us i think we are expecting the construction loans to go up in the new york area and in our popular association banking subsidiary were also expecting growth there and as you know in florida after there was that horrible accident with the condominium they passed a number of laws and regulations that require that condominiums do certain appraisals of the assessment of their the structural integrity of the units and i think theres a deadline coming up in february 25th so we expect to see a lot of activity there and hopefully well be able to pick up some more regular commercial growth but and generally in puerto rico its the economic environment that gives us the confidence to maintain the guidance on the loan growth popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay great thats good color thanks and then looking at deposits it really feels like you found a stable level here on ddas as a percentage of total deposits should we expect that ddas keep track growth in the overall deposits from here or could there still be some incremental diminishment ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc that depends a lot on the interest rate environment we did get benefit of this as a tax season so theres tax refunds and that goes into peoples usually it goes into peoples dda accounts well have to see the consumers the higherend consumer and the commercial clients are still looking for alternatives to regular demand deposits so we can expect that trend to continue as interest rates remain high but we do feel that our regular retail demand deposits are reflecting really the strength of our branch network and they may had a bit more of a significant pickup this quarter although a lot of the refunds occur in april also so well get some benefit of that in april so that may have been a shortterm thing but in general we feel pretty strong about our retail deposit franchise jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thank you operator the next question in the queue is alex twerdahl of piper sandler please go ahead alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co good morning all ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning alex jorge j garc√≠a a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc good morning alex alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co wanted to go back to a comment you made jorge about just the amount of churn in the loan portfolio and kind of just the amount of new generation need just to stay in to stay where you are and then the yield lift that is kind of inherent with that we see some nice yield lift this quarter like at overall loan yields like can you give us a sense for like what kind of loan yield lift still remains in the portfolio assuming we see churn at similar rates to what weve seen in the past couple of quarters jorge j garc√≠a a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 alex i think id be lying if i tell you i had that level of granularity lets say lets look at the different components the investment portfolio we feel very comfortable that youre going to get a basis point plus lift in that i think with the loans it depends on when those loans were made it depends what type of loans they are i would expect particularly around our commercial clients that any renewals in this environment should reflect the higher yields but we do see perhaps some maybe compression in some of those margins i guess at this stage i will stick to the nii guidance alex alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay ignacio earlier you talked about some of the long portfolio categories you expect to grow the commercial the construction the auto are there any categories that youd expect to be a headwind in terms of overall balances that maybe would decline in the next year ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well weve tightened up our some of our credit policies around some of the unsecured consumer portfolio so i dont expect you to see a lot of growth in personal loans and credit cards so those are really the only areas that i would pinpoint that i think were not i dont feel and its for a reason its because weve tightened up so we can expect that those are probably and personal loans especially are subject to amortization so if we dont originate at the rate we were its going to go down so those are the only two categories i would highlight mortgage depends on the interest rate so its not a great environment for originating mortgage loans because of the high interest rates so were basically limited to home purchase others are refinancing now however were holding more in portfolios so that sort of makes up so i think mortgage may be more steady i dont think i dont know if mortgage will go down but itll be steady but i do think that personal loans and credit card that were not expecting on alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks for that color and then you alluded to a million mortgage in the press release and bpna that migrated into npls was that a residential mortgage or is that multifamily ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc its a residential mortgage i think lidio will give you more color on that he wants me to give you more color on that yeah this was a loan we made in a very expensive home in new york and its not something we normally do it was a special situation for our client that had other relationships with us and so its really in my opinion its something that its a oneoff so but it is a residential mortgage but you have a solid loantovalue ratio so were not anticipating losing any money on that loan alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co good and it would it be like a highprofile divorce or something like that that would result in something like that ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 no i dont think again its not im pretty certain its not a divorce i dont know all the facts but its just someone who went into npls and they again its a it is a single loan to a single borrower in a residential property in new york a very luxury property something we normally did we did it as an accommodation for business reasons and its i would its a oneoff alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay with that when i look at the yields on the mortgage portfolio it looked like they dropped this quarter is that would that be sort of interest like reversal of accrued interest related to that loan jorge j garc√≠a a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc i mean there will be certainly some impact with us because we would reverse three months worth of interest related to that loan but the mortgage portfolio does get impacted in puerto rico by tax equivalent adjustments alex and then i think in the fourth quarter we may have had a positive benefit in the fourth quarter related to those adjustments so its more that the fourth quarter was maybe a higher yield because of tax equivalent adjustment alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then i just wanted to ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc puerto rico yeah alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co sorry ignacio ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc no i was just saying remember that the fha loans in puerto rico are tax exempt to us here the interest on the fha loan alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co got it okay and then i just wanted to ask another one on the multifamily just because you did provide some pretty good color and it has become a bigger issue for the investment community can you do you happen to have like loantovalues of some of the loans either portfolio overall and particularly the loans that are coming due this year or maturing this year as well as debt service coverage ratios lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc could you repeat the question sorry popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc whether i can repeat it whether we have more color in terms of loantovalue ratio and debt service ratios on the multifamily coming due this year lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc i mean i will say generally i will say that we underwrite to any loantovalue debt service coverage in excess of we will consider providing more detail in our future filings but today we dont have that information alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay i appreciate you taking all my questions ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from kelly motta of kbw please go ahead kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey everyone good morning most of my questions have been asked and answered ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning kelly kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks at this point but i guess the rotce target by youve talked about it a lot in the past and i think you put it for the first time in writing in the proxy this year just wondering i know weve spoken about how you anticipate getting there talking about mostly top line and maybe a capital component but asking a different way what do you think are the biggest risks or headwinds that could cause you to fall short of that number just wondering how we should be thinking about that ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc jorge do you want to take it popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 jorge j garc√≠a a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc sure as i mentioned earlier there is a lot of efforts related to the transformation that will drive operational efficiency for us to be able to get to those results i think at the end of this quarter we had something like ongoing transformation projects throughout the organization that all eventually contribute to that success to get to those numbers i think delays in the projects i mean extending where we dont see the lift or the benefits at the time that we think were going to be able to see could have an impact on that guidance certainly interest rate environment things like that generally impact bank earnings will have a spillover effect of that kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats helpful and then in your prepared remarks you mentioned with capital planning one thing youre looking at with regards to whether to come in again with some capital return is your tce ratio and that got as low as a four handle in i know were not guiding specifically to cet1 yet or ready to but just wondering if theres any sort of line in the sand that we should be thinking about in terms of where you might be comfortable with the tce ratio in terms of like a bottoming level just to be mindful on where modeling capital jorge j garc√≠a a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc i mean kelly when we look at tce i mean obviously we are there are levels that were comfortable at but its not just a bright line black and white we do like to look at the rate scenario what is the projected rate environment what is our sensitivity in our investment portfolio so all those things contribute to our confidence and the level that were confident at we believe that we will be able to come to you in the second half of this year with more information take into consideration all the aspects kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood thanks so much ill step back operator and we had a followup registered from gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets your line is open again gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you gentlemen can you share with us the latest update on the prepa bankruptcy proceedings obviously youre a lot closer to it than the folks here in mainland but any insights on how its winding down and possibly a final settlement sometime this year ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah i mean they had a series of hearings and obviously they had hoped originally to have it done in the i think in the first quarter i think theyre probably looking now maybe second or maybe early part of third quarter theres a lot of itll be done this year one way or the other i think popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 its been delayed theres been objections from many sides some arguing that the proposed rate hikes that would pay for the continued charge are too high the bond some of the bondholders claiming that the payout is too low so youve got people arguing all sides of the equation but i think im pretty confident maybe not second quarter but third quarter probably this gets done this year i think other than that its hard to predict because these legal proceedings are complex and the judges trying to figure it out therell be an appeal obviously whatever happens there will be an appeal under the permissive statute appeals are supposed to be handled expeditiously i mean theres always a chance that the that at the end of the day at the final wire they reach an agreement with some of the objecting bondholders i dont think for obviously but theres always that possibility but i think this is it would be hard to speculate exactly when but i would go out on a limb and say itll get done this year gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just as a quick followup can you remind us what drives the governments deposits you mentioned theyre elevated right now talking about the securities earlier in the call but what should we keep an eye on for the government to draw down those deposits i know theres some seasonality due to tax payments but if there was a kind of a downward shift in what should we keep an eye on to see if that happens ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc i think the most the thing is what you mentioned the increase is tax seasonality i think now that were paying debt on the public paying interest on the public debt we have a july payment theyll come up so theyll be a debt payment made on july other than that its really just the way the government runs now one of the things that could impact the government that the fiscal board has mentioned is that in the postpandemic period theres been a number of special packages for all states and municipalities some of that money has been used by puerto rico for like the education department and other things like that that money runs out eventually that was limited so part of that will have to be come from the treasury of the puerto rico government so i think going forward as some of this postpandemic stimulus relief comes down youll probably see puerto rico spending more we continue have more infrastructure projects part of those projects require puerto rico to pay part of the cost so some of that will come down other than that its hard for us to judge i mean over time we do expect the liquidity will go down for the reasons i said i mean some of the money that theyve been using for education and for health and other things will have to be replaced by puerto rico money from the budget and i think part of the money that they have they need to spend for the infrastructure projects to put our share and then theres also some covid money that had a term limit so that if we dont use it it has to be returned to the treasury so i mean those are the best handles we dont have great visibility to actually to the government but those are the normal things that we see already we saw the government the march numbers already reflect a significant amount of the refund because the government was refunding is refunding given the liquidity its refunding taxpayers much faster than they used to in the old days so some of that has gone out but those are the factors that we frankly we see popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good appreciate the color thank you operator thank you we have no further questions in the queue so ill return the call back over to you ignacio alvarez for any closing remarks ignacio alvarez president chief executive
