executive officer director popular inc good morning and thank you for joining the call our results for the quarter and the full year were solid and reflect the strength of our franchise our record annual net income of billion reflects an increase of million above our annual net income of million the increase was largely driven by the benefit of the evertec popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 transactions and the partial reversal of the dta valuation allowance the results also reflect higher net interest income partially offset by higher provision expense and higher operating expenses the results included a provision benefit of million during the summer we completed the acquisition of key customerfacing channels from evertec and also made important changes to our contractual relationship with them leveraging these transactions we have embarked on a broadbased multiyear technological and business process transformation the needs and expectation of our clients as well as the competitive landscape have evolved requiring us to make important investments in our technological infrastructure and adopt more agile practices our technology and business transformation will be a significant priority for the company over the next three years and beyond we believe that there continues to be an opportunity for growth in our primary market as well as within our existing customer base and these efforts will help capitalize upon that opportunity we are confident that these investments will make us a stronger more efficient and profitable company throughout we continue to return capital to our shareholders during the year we repurchased million shares of common stock for million which surpassed our original expectation of million we also increased our quarterly common stock dividend to per share representing nearly million in dividends paid in credit quality remained strong throughout we are pleased with how our portfolios have continued to perform particularly with net chargeoffs well below historical levels and a lower level of nonperforming loans our capital levels are strong with yearend common equity tier ratio of our tangible book value ended at a decrease year over year primarily due to unrealized losses on investment securities however during the fourth quarter tangible book value increased by please turn to slide our quarterly net income excluding the partial reversal of the dta valuation allowance was million or million lower than the adjusted third quarter net income of million fourth quarter results were impacted by lower net interest income which reflected higher loan income but was more than offset by the higher cost of public deposits as well as a higher provision for credit losses loan growth was strong and broad based during the quarter both geographically and across most loan segments total loan balances held in portfolio grew by million commercial loan growth in particular was healthy at most banks in the fourth quarter our net interest margin decreased by basis points to in the quarter higher deposit costs particularly in our puerto rico public deposit portfolio and a ph couple of banks impacted the margin this was offset in part by an improvement in asset mix due to loan growth and a reduction in the investment portfolio credit quality trends remained favorable during the period nonperforming loans decreased in the quarter and net chargeoffs have remained well below prepandemic levels please turn to slide our customer base in puerto rico grew by approximately during the year reaching million unique customers adoption of digital channels among our retail customers continues to be strong active users on our mi banco platform exceeded million or of our customer base additionally we continue to capture more than of our deposits through digital channels this trend remains significantly higher than prepandemic levels and well above our ph island peers popular inc

auto loan and lease balances at bppr increased by million and million respectively in the fourth quarter the dollar value of credit and debit card sales of our customers increased by sequentially and was above the fourth quarter of as on the mainland mortgage originations puerto rico have been impacted by rising rates and limited inventory of available properties the dollar value of mortgage originations at bppr decreased by compared to the fourth quarter of last year driven by lower refinance activity due to the interest rate environment however loans to finance the purchase of homes increased only during the same period the local economy continued to perform well during the fourth quarter and business activity has remained strong we remain encouraged by solid employment levels in december total nonfarm employment in puerto rico increased slightly from its level in september and was higher than in december of new auto sales increased by in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in while auto sales declined by in the year was the second highest year of sales since easily surpassing prepandemic levels evidencing continued robust demand for cars and audio gap the industry is forecasting new car sales of with well above prepandemic levels the tourism and hospitality sector continues to be a source of strength for the local economy as puerto rico is a proper destination for mainland residents airport traffic has remained robust year to date to december total passenger traffic increased by compared to hotel demand has also remained strong occupancy rates were up more than basis points in and the average daily room wait continues to compare favorably to historical results in short we are pleased with the results for the year particularly our robust loan growth and continued strength in credit quality we are mindful of the global economic uncertainty and market volatility but remain optimistic about the future of puerto rico our primary market and our ability to manage through any potential challenges that may lie ahead i now turn the call over to carlos for more details on our financial results carlos j vázquez chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc thank you ignacio good morning before we turn to fourth quarter results let me expand on populars full year performance which is included in the appendix to this presentation and todays press release in we reported record annual net income of billion million of our annual net income the increase was largely driven by the benefit of the evertec transactions and the partial reversal of the dta valuation allowance somewhat offset by provision expense our net interest income increased by year over year to billion due to higher rates loan growth and the change in the mix of earning assets for the year we reported an million provision for credit losses which compares to a provision benefit of million in noninterest income increased by million year over year primarily driven by the impact of the evertec transactions operating expenses increased in to billion with higher personnel technology professional fees and regulatory cost please turn to slide net income for the fourth quarter was million this compares to million in  excluding the impact of the evertec transactions in  and the dta reversal in  net income decreased million to million in  net interest income for the fourth quarter was million a decrease of million from  interest income grew by million from loan growth on both banks as well as higher yields on loans popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 and investment securities this was more than offset by higher interest expense on deposits resulting from increased deposit rates mainly from puerto rico public deposits and to a lesser extent popular bank noninterest income was million a decrease of million from  the results of the third quarter included a million pretax gain on the evertec transactions and a favorable fair value purchase price adjustment of ph million related to the us equipment finance business we acquired in excluding these items the remaining variance in noninterest income resulted mainly from lower deposit service fees the fourth quarter noninterest income results fully embed the changes in overdraft policies and the reduction in equity pickup from the sale of our evertec shares the results also include an million gain on the sale of a previously writtenoff investments excluding this gain the noninterest income for the quarter would have been approximately million for we expect noninterest income to continue around this million per quarter run rate or approximately million for the the provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter was million compared to million in the third quarter total operating expenses were million in the quarter a decrease of million from the prior quarter  includes million expenses indiscernible to the evertec transactions and a million goodwill impairment on our us equipment finance business excluding these items expenses increased by million mostly resulting from a million increase in technology expenses seasonally higher business promotion expenses by million higher other processing and transactional services by million mainly due to higher network incentives received during the prior quarter and higher professional fees for we expect annual expenses of approximately billion compared to our expenses of billion during the drivers of the million increase will be first continued increase in personal expenses driven primarily by the previously announced increase in our minimum hourly wage from to which took effect on january this will add approximately million to expenses in additionally the market salary adjustments that were made effective on july of last year will be in effect for the fullyear there will also be a indiscernible increase that traditionally is granted in the summer these two items will add approximately million to expenses in these actions are necessary to keep our compensation competitive second we expect that the fdics basis points increase in assessment rate to all depositary institutions will add million to expenses patient and retirement health care expenses will also increase by million finally as ignacio described in his opening remarks we have undertaken a significant multiyear corporate transformation initiative as part of this transformation we aim to expand our digital capabilities modernize our technology platform and to implement agile and efficient business processes across the entire company since completing the evertec transactions on july through the end of last year we invested million towards this effort primarily in professional fees and technology expenses in we anticipate transformational data expenses of million these technological ways of working and operational investments will result in an enhanced digital experience for our clients as well as better technology and more efficient processes for our employees we expect these efforts to contribute to higher earnings and better efficiency resulting on a sustainable rotce target by the end of to facilitate the transparency of our progress in some of these efforts we have now separated technology professional fees and transactional activities ph standalone items in our income statement popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 our effective tax rate for the quarter was a benefit of compared to an expense of in the third quarter the income tax benefit in  was mainly due to the million partial reversal of the dta valuation allowance of the us operation excluding this impact the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was compared to in the third quarter this partial reversal was based on our evaluation of the sustained profitability of the us operation over the last two years as well as evidence of stable credit metrics while considering the remaining life of the net operating losses as of december the dta related to us operations was million net of our valuation allowance of million for the fullyear we expect the effective tax rate to be in a range of to please turn to slide net interest income was million on a taxable equivalent basis it was million million lower than in the third quarter net interest margin decreased by basis points to in  on a taxable equivalent basis nim was a decrease of basis points the decrease is driven by higher interest expense on deposits due to a significant though anticipated 159basispoint increase in the cost of public deposits it was partially offset by higher loan balances and yields indiscernible improved mix of earning assets at the end of the fourth quarter public deposits were roughly billion a decrease of billion from  we expect public deposits to be in a range of billion to billion during over the next couple of quarters the balance of public deposits should increase given the cyclical nature of tax collections however the balances should decrease during the second half of excluding puerto rico public deposits deposit balance has declined by billion in the quarter mainly from excess cash balances of corporate clients these declines are reflective of clients pursuing better yields on excess ph liquidity popular continues to have a strong relationship with ph these clients our puerto rico commercial deposit balances remained billion higher than they were in december of we will continue to actively manage the cost of commercial deposits taking into consideration the overall client relationship and our liquidity position retail deposit balances remain stable our ending loan balances increased by million or almost compared to  and are up by billion or just under year to date commercial loan growth was particularly strong and all other loan segments were higher in the quarter except for construction we are encouraged by credit demand at bppr and pb we will continue to take advantage of opportunities to extend credit thereby improving the use and yield of our existing liquidity while we expect to see continued strong loan growth in we do not anticipate it will replicate 2022s exceptional growth rate please turn to slide year to date our retail deposit franchise particularly in puerto rico has continued to track below historical beta commercial deposit betas have remained low ph to are now tracking slightly above the prior cycle combined retail and commercial deposits represent a lower proportion of total deposits compared to the last ph three cycle due to the increase in public deposits as we discussed last quarter during the rapid shift of to higher interest shortterm interest rates we expect a significant increase in the cost of public deposits in the fourth quarter the cost increased by basis points we expect the magnitude of the increase in cost of public deposits to moderate in  to approximately basis points as we had described in the past the deposit pricing agreement with puerto rico public sector clients is market linked with a lag this source of funding results in attractive in an attractive spread under market rates popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 please turn to slide in we reported a decrease in fair value of the investment portfolio that we expect to be temporary our investment portfolio is almost entirely comprised of treasury and industry mortgagebacked securities which carry minimal credit risk the bond portfolio has an average duration of approximately years at the position ph roll down the yield curve therefore value will convert to par and the mark will go down to zero as discussed in our last webcast during the rapid increase in interest rates in as well as the uncertain outlook for interest rates in october we transferred to heldtomaturity billion of us treasuries in the fourth to sixthyear term thereby reducing the future impact of rates on tangible book value at the time this action reduced aoci exposure to interest rates by about a third when transferred to htm these positions had a pretax unrealized loss of million which will be amortized back into capital throughout the life of the transferred positions as of the end of the fourth quarter the balance of the unrealized loss stood at million a reduction of million we expect a similar quarterly amortization through the yield on treasury securities remains the same and no losses were recognized as a result of this move if transfer doesnt have a material effect on our liquidity as we continue to maintain a large availableforsale portfolio in shortterm treasuries and cash indiscernible the changes in realized gains and losses in aoci have an impact on the corporations annual capital ratios as well as those of our whollyowned banking subsidiaries they do not impact regulatory capital ratios please turn to slide our return on tangible equity was in the quarter regulatory capital levels remained strong our common equity tier ratio increased by basis points in  to in december we completed our previously announced million asr repurchasing approximately million shares an average purchase price of to summarize our capital actions last year we repurchased million common stock or million shares we had two separate asrs and increase our quarterly dividend by per share to per share tangible book value at quarter end was per share an increase of per share from  driven mostly by quarterly net income of million and a favorable variance of million in unrealized losses on securities availableforsale this is partially offset by dividends of million declared in the quarter our outlook of capital return has not changed anchored in our strong regulatory capital ratios over time we expect our regulatory capital ratios to gravitate towards the levels of our mainland peers plus a spread given the continued economic uncertainty we still plan to revisit our future capital actions in the second half of once we have more clarity around the outlook for interest rate and the economy with that i turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc thank you carlos and good morning overall popular continue to reflect stable credit quality trends with low levels of net chargeoff and decreasing nonperforming loans we remain encouraged by the performance of our loan book postpandemic specifically early delinquency net chargeoff and nonperforming loan formation continue to trend significantly below prepandemic levels we also believe that the improvement in the risk profile of the corporations loan portfolio positions popular to operate successfully under more difficult economic conditions we remain vigilant and continue to closely monitor popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 changes in borrower performance and the macroeconomic environment given potential economic headwinds rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty turning to slide number nonperforming assets decreased by million to million this quarter driven by an npl decrease of million coupled with an oreo decrease of million in puerto rico npls decreased by million driven by lower mortgage npls of million and lower commercial npls by million in part offset by higher auto npls by million in the us npls decreased by million mainly due to a million chargeoff on a previously reserved commercial borrower in the healthcare industry compared to the third quarter npl inflows excluding consumer loans decreased by million driven by the us health care relationship mentioned previously that was placed in nonaccrual in the prior quarter offset in part by higher mortgage inflows in puerto rico at the end of the quarter the ratio of npls to total loans heldinportfolio remained flat at compared to the previous quarter turning to slide number net chargeoff amounted to million or annualized basis points of average loans heldinportfolio compared to million or basis points in the prior quarter the results of the quarter were impacted by the million chargeoff on the previously reserved health care relationship in the us excluding this item net chargeoff ratio was comparable to last quarter at basis points in puerto rico net chargeoff remained stable increasing by million quarter over quarter mainly driven by higher consumer net chargeoff by million mostly due to the auto portfolio in part offset by lower mortgage net chargeoff by million the ph corporation allowance for credit losses increased by million or to million driven by changes in macroeconomic scenarios higher loan volumes and changes in credit quality the ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans heldinportfolio remain stable at compared to in the previous quarter the ratio of allowance for credit losses to npls heldinportfolio was compared to in the prior quarter the provision for credit losses was an expense of million compared to million in the previous quarter reflecting the changes in allowance for credit losses and the net chargeoff activity in puerto rico the provision for credit losses was million compared to million in the prior quarter and in the us the provision was million compared to million in the prior quarter please turn to slide number as discussed in prior webcast we leveraged moodys analytics for the us and puerto rico economic forecast notwithstanding general economic uncertainty moodys baseline outlook remains for the us economy to continue recessionfree moodys fourth quarter forecast however reflects a slowdown in the economy with lower gdp growth for both puerto rico and the us the baseline scenarios assume a annualized gdp growth for puerto rico and the us of and respectively compared to and in the previous quarter the reduction is due to the expected slowdown in the economy as a result of tight monetary policy the average unemployment rate remain consistent quarter over quarter our framework for the allowance incorporates multiple economic scenarios in the fourth quarter we assign the highest probability to the baseline scenario followed closely by the more pessimistic recession scenario s3 the quarteroverquarter difference in the allowance for credit losses was driven by the macroeconomic scenarios and portfolio changes which includes loan growth and changes in credit quality to summarize our loan portfolio continue to exhibit strong credit quality metrics in the fourth quarter with low net chargeoff and decreasing non popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 performing loans we remain authentic to the indiscernible environment we remain encouraged by the postpandemic performance of our loan book with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks thank you ignacio

and assisted impacted employees looking ahead i am optimistic about the economic outlook in puerto rico our primary market while we are aware of the macroeconomic headwinds related to inflation and geopolitical risks we are confident that given the amount of stimulus support from federal funds puerto rico will continue its growth path albeit perhaps at a slower pace marks populars 130th anniversary since we have successfully adapted and led through changing conditions and we are proud of our history and the legacy that made popular what it is today a strong vibrant organization with

customers providing our colleagues a workplace where they can thrive promoting progress in the communities we serve and generating sustainable value for our shareholders the team is energizing is energized and looking forward to another strong year we are now ready to answer your questions popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question today comes from the line of timur braziler from wells fargo please go ahead your line is now open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning thanks for the questions a good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe starting on expenses and the technology and business process transformation that has been laid out i guess on the back end of that how should we think about popular is this investment and kind of standing up evertec and getting that investment kind of up to where you expect it to be or is this getting popular more broadly on pace with the broader group or do you expect that at the back end of for popular to be an industry leader when it comes to tech and innovation ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah i think this is ignacio i think thank you for the question i think evertec was the initial phase its more than just evertec obviously evertec has positioned ourselves to be able to begin to transform our technological foundation so its more than just taking over the services evertec was providing for us that was an essential step but obviously our goal is to be able to compete with the different entities that are coming to the market especially in terms of giving digital options to our clients so yeah we aspire we aspire to be if not best in class in top quartile in terms of the services and the products that we can offer for our clients and popular is traditionally have been a leader in technology in puerto rico and given whats happening now i think its more important than ever that we take this initiative on timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then in terms of investing into this initiative is the expectation kind of million per year through or does that ramp higher as you get closer to completion carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yeah im not sure weve been able to nail that down at this point in time timur i think the what we expect will happen over time is that the expense will shift from the present expense which is more weighted towards professional services and consultants and people that are trying to help us stand up and set up what we want to do and where we want to go it will shift to execution so again we havent nailed down the number looking popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 forward to the composition of the expense will change into execution and putting in place the systems and the technology that were designing and selecting right now timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then maybe moving to nii and nim it looks like the inflection point happened here in the fourth quarter just maybe an outlook for the magnitude of the remaining inflection as those public funds continue to lag already happened interest rate hikes and then more importantly kind of once that lag is complete whats the outlook for nii and nim growth from there carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yes i mean the components that led to our margin coming down this quarter those pressures still exist for the first quarter and moving forward you described them properly that the most important one being the increase in cost of public deposits we as we said last quarter we expect nim to retake an upward trend in exactly when in it happens will depend on the interaction of the drivers and you know what the drivers are the rate of loan growth the rate of change in interest rates and deposit balances are the biggest three drivers and the interaction between those three will dictate exactly what happens in the year but we do expect nim to retake an upward trend in the year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay then maybe one last one for me if i can just circling back on fee income the guide for around ph a quarter im just wondering when does that inflect and when do we start seeing some of the positive attributes from the combination with evertec and getting those assets back in house carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc well the biggest driver of the move down from our prior guidance to this guidance is a change in the fact that we dont own the shares of evertec anymore number one number two the change in our draft policies and number three the change on our practice of shutting mortgages that we are not selling anymore so those are the biggest drivers of the shift down to ph per quarter roughly always remember theres always some seasonality in that number so it goes up and down for different things during the year but that is the right range we continue initiatives on our business initiatives to try to continue to move rates up in different fronts so hopefully as those initiatives succeed we can start moving rates up from where from the ph and some of those are already being signed and implemented if everything works well we may start to see some of that in but our best guess right now is ph per quarter timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator thank you our next question today comes from the line of alex twerdahl from piper sandler please go ahead your line is now open popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys a good morning alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co i just wanted to ask some of the questions that timur just asked a little bit differently im just curious when you put out a target for why does that represent sort of an inflection point or an endpoint in some of these initiatives or how can you pick those that date or that year ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc this is ignacio basically we picked that year the transformation initiative is going to be an ongoing effort its a way its going to change the way we work but obviously to sort of measure our success we wanted to pick an initial threeyear period where we see where were going to be at the end of the threeyear period and basically thats how we reached it was kind of arbitrary but we felt three years gave us enough time to implement the measures that were doing and to give them time to bear fruit so and thats how we picked it but obviously this is indiscernible and obviously we expect all these efforts to be sustained and now its sustainable so its not like were going to reset and stop but keep growing incrementally over time alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co right and then is popular a leaner institution at that point or like whats going to be different i mean obviously every bank is investing in technology meaningfully but does this allow you to operate with a reduced branch count or sort of what like what would we see that would be different at that point ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc im not sure branch count is the thing youd expect to see the most i mean that would depend on traffic we can talk about branches separately but i think obviously were aiming to do a lot more things digitally and were also aiming to do a lot more things selfservice so for example making our underwriting more more automatic so you dont have to have as much manual intervention this is across especially our businesses but itll apply to everything well hopefully we will do our it will help us with our compliance were investing on some technology which is very manual today very people oriented so really i cant give you a specific date but definitely over time we should see a lot less manual intervention in many of our processes be the underwriting be there compliance be there everything so i think thats the goal the goal is to be more digital more have more selfservice for our clients and hopefully over time thats going to impact us favorably popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay are there any sort of chunks of the initiative that might hit at any certain point in time you mentioned that a lot of the fees right now are being conducted towards the planning phase and then theres going to be implementation phase which maybe is more of a thing but are there segments that you kind of we can sort of look at over the next couple of maybe even more in the near term to sort of get a good sense for how to track the progress ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well im not sure within the near term but one of the things that we obviously are going to want to be able to report to you is what percentage of our loan applications will be digitally enhanced and obviously that we will be able to give you numbers on that well be tracking that and obviously that will reflect in our efficiencies weve already implemented some things that are less technologyoriented because again this is more than just technology its also process improvement in terms of how do we make sure that our pricing strategy for products and services including cash management are coherent across the organization we expect that to bear fruit pretty much immediately but ph honestly would be a game changer but thatll bear fruit immediately so well be watching very carefully that in terms of revenues that were getting from cash management were going to make important investments in that area now the technological area of cash management will take us a few years i mean when you change a system for cash management thatll be a couple of year process but were very hopeful that will derive benefits for us but again well be following and closely tracking that things about doing enhanced applications selfservice applications so those are things that we will be tracking carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yeah i think one of the things that we have a very strong belief that there is still a big opportunity for growth in puerto rico with by deepening the relationships we have with our existing clients so a lot of the effort thats going into transformation is for us to execute on that belief meaning that we will be in a position to provide clients quicker and better service to offer them products that fit their need in a more efficient way and with that we increase the transaction of our clients that means we have more happy clients we have more employees that can actually execute with excellence what were trying to do as far as client service and all those things add up to positive outcomes as far as the contribution of all those clients to the bank i think thats a fair these are incremental efforts so small things will start happening in a few months other things will start happening next year so the bigger things are technology dependent will probably be so a big back ended because we have to make the investment and implement the systems to achieve what we want to achieve but we expect that therell be some quick wins starting soon lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc yeah to add to what carlos was saying i mean one of the big initiatives is designed that what we call personalization and segmentation and therefore and that involves a lot of investment in our data abilities also but the idea is that well be able to offer our clients products that they need faster and as you know we have by far the largest client base in puerto rico both retail and commercial and if we can just penetrate that market the popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 cost of our cost of acquisition will be much below any possible competitors so we are going to put a lot of effort into the personalization and segmentation carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc and the last comment for you to get a sense of what were talking about and what we think we have to build the best digital banking offering in puerto rico already but what were seeking is to be able to provide more products and services to our clients through that offering and to allow us to roll out new offerings a lot faster than we can do it now so were changing the architecture of what is a marketleading digital offering so that we can be a lot more effective in providing more and new services quicker to our clients than we are today so the client will never see the change in back in architecture but they will see that the more efficient and bigger offering once weve done that alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then with the rotce obviously theres a lot of pieces to that and it could mean a lot of different things so can you give us some of the assumptions on capital levels or like anything else to kind of help us really figure out what it actually means for profitability carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc no at this point in time weve chosen that one because it sort of encompasses a result of everything alex and theres you are correct theres a lot of pieces that compose that we are not in a position to talk about the pieces specifically yet right now but again we think this is the most comprehensive measure of everything that we do so weve chosen to hang our hat on that one for the moment but we at this point in time we havent disclosed the components that will get us there and theres a lot of things that indiscernible can change along the way as well alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just one final one from me before i get back in the queue you gave us the increase in the government deposits in the first quarter of ph assuming we get two more hikes where do those peak out i mean can you just spell it out for us carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc im afraid where they peak out youll have to ask the fed if its true that they go down to two more ph and thats it and then they sit tight then a quarter after that youll indiscernible basis points more expensive and but it really is market ph leading so depending on the fed again our best guess of the fed increases if it will give us ph again roughly if its ph still more they will that will end up being about basis points higher the quarter after that and once the rates start moving in the other direction then well see that well start seeing the benefit a quarter after that so i would love to be able to answer your question but i cant read the mind of the fed very well alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 but they do peak out below i mean the last time they peaked at basis points but below where the fed peaked out is that a reasonable assumption for this tightening cycle carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc it is timing and we would ultimately that the question you were asking is whats the spread that we make under deposit we have never answered that question purposely and were not going to start today but obviously we do make a positive spread on this on the deposits alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks for taking my questions operator thank you operator instructions the next question today comes from the line of kelly motta from kbw please go ahead your line is now open kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning thanks for the question i maybe asking the government deposits question a little bit differently i appreciate the color around margin and how you expect that to i believe it start to inflect at some point this year does that commentary there require a certain amount of rolloff the government deposits or is that irrespective of level just trying to get a sense of how much that may be a driver of that inflecting nim you speak of carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc that commentary incorporates the outlook we expressed on the indiscernible deposits that they will remain between ph and for the year again its not a constant ph to theyre probably going to be slightly higher than that in the first half of the year and then maybe slightly lower than that in the second half of the year but that is what is incorporated in the components of that commentary kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you appreciate it and just a point of clarification on your expense guidance that billion that you gave just want to confirm that includes the innovation stuff that youre doing and that million is in on top of that billion carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc that number includes the million lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc yes definitely incorporated within it popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay excellent thank you so much maybe last one for me i appreciate the time is on capital i know you reiterated that you plan to revisit your capital plans in the second half of this year wondering if that kind of your decision to do that is theres a certain level of tce where you would feel comfortable stepping back in is there any sort of parameters around that youd be willing to share and thats part one and then part two of the question is by second half of the year do you think maybe by sometime in july given the accretion back on aoci is that kind of the timing were looking at here carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yeah so we try to answer both questions kelly there is no tce target that would trigger us to do something or not do something what i think if anything what will be more important on how we think about this is again getting a more clear consensus of whats happening with the economy and whats going to happen with interest rates moving forward so i think those two components are probably more important theres again look theres no magic number of tce that will get us there as ignacio said last quarter our best guess is that well get the clarity were looking for in the summer and thats where indiscernible comes from the second half of the year but if that clarity comes in may then were a couple of months ahead if that clarity comes in september we may be a couple of months behind but no specific target the outlook and there being consensus a consensus outlook on the economy and interest rates are probably the two most important inputs into the timing of our revisiting of the capital fund again the overall view of capital is unchanged were only slightly adjusting the timing here and when we execute not our intent of what we want to do kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great i appreciate all the color ill step back carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc thank you operator thank you the next question today comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi ignacio hi carlos carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 good morning happy new year gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc happy new year to you too carlos on the oci or aoci i should say when you look at it you had in the availableforsale portfolio about billion of unrealized losses can you share with us what kind of interest rate environment will we need to see for that number to fall materially from here carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc lower gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i agree with that lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc no i mean look i mean the portfolio has about a year duration so that can give you some sensitivity on the entire piece right so you could probably run some calculations based on the duration and the size of the portfolio should just give you an idea of roughly speaking where the unrealized could move carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yeah the obviously the as indiscernible said the portfolio is ph surged on the short end so we are were the biggest bang for the buck youll probably get if its shortened rates lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc short and intermediate carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc intermediate rates move lower i think everyone is going to happy if the year comes down by the year does not have big of an effect on our aoci of the shorter and intermediate terms lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc yeah the other thing gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc theres a significant amount of bonds that mature every quarter so the portfolios ph laddered up all the way up to the six years but in fact we probably have about billion or so that mature any given quarter so that also shortens the duration as time passes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it and even though because yeah im sorry go ahead ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc and those get reinvested in current rates lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc right gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc right right no the reason i asked is that i noticed that the agency portion of the portfolio which has the largest unrealized loss has a maturity of years and even though i know the total afs is under ph i didnt know if that meant that part of the portfolio the longer end of the curve is something were going to watch lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc yeah that piece that portion of the portfolio is mostly agency ph factors so we put the weighted average life of the instruments thats a mix of 15year and 30year mortgagebacked securities that has a slightly different basis in treasuries so that will be a function of where intermediate rates move as well as where the mortgagebacked to treasury basis moves as well so we have some some relief for that in the fourth quarter if those trends continue thatll be positive news for that but again itll be all be subject to where the market sees the risks gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then following up on the technology commentary that you guys gave us ignacio i think you said in your prepared remarks or actually in response to a question that popular has traditionally been a leader in technology in puerto rico so somewhat surprising that this overhaul is coming but be it as it is were you guys seeing or are you seeing evidence that other entrants are making headway against your core customers and youre starting to lose some of these customers or what was the real or is that part of the reason for the big spend thats coming ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc no i think that when i say we are traditionally been a leader in the technology thats true but we feel the world is changing much faster and we may have been a little bit behind where we normally would be on this kind of a popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 curve we havent lost customers yet but were not going to wait to lose customers we are seeing there are certain areas where you see more us entrants for example credit cards where you see more the us issuers coming in with features and different things that we may be a little bit behind but really we want to get ahead of this we dont want to leave ourselves open to future digital entrants taking away our clients so basically we think we really think that if we offer a topnotch digital experience and you combine that with our branch network and you combine that with the diversity the diverse services we offer our client that we have an unbeatable solution if we fall on any of those areas then we could become indiscernible and were not about to let that happen so yes we know that technology is a tough game and we may not be able to match the investments as some of the bigger huge banks but we have to stay at least giving our clients what they expect in todays world and our clients in puerto rico just like anywhere else they expect a better digital experience and they expect a more personalized digital experience and were going to work hard to give them that carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc to give some more color in ignacios comment gerard when i talked about our data offering to our clients i said it was market leading which it is and i spoke about the back end the architecture of it we find ourselves wanting to roll out more things at a faster speed than our present architecture allows us to do so again what were doing is doing a lot of work in the back end the client will never even knew this was happening but the client will feel it because the speed at which well be able to offer a new thing add more things will go up so that is the kind of thing were talking about it is improving the core of our technology and again the client may not see that in their phone app but theyll see it in the in our capacity to offer them more personalized offerings more personalized services and new services faster than we can do today gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then lidio you mentioned you gave us some insights into the credit and credit obviously has been strong for you folks and your peers two questions one you gave us some of the assumptions i think in the moodys outlook on real gdp growth what kind of unemployment rates are you factoring in i think you said theyre constant but what are those numbers and two are there any sectors within the portfolio that youre currently indiscernible to spending more time really focusing on just to make sure nothing gets tripped up if we go into some sort of shallow recession lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc we have on a yearly basis we have on page of the deck the assumptions for unemployment rates both for puerto rico and the us under the baseline stronger growth and recession scenario so i will leave you to look at those as to whats the second part of the question im sorry gerard carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 any gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes no thats okay and just what parts of the portfolio are you guys really focused on to make sure that if we do go into a shallow recession youre prepared to handle it lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc i would say small business lending is an area of focus i mean we continue to be pleased how the portfolio has continued to behave postpandemic indiscernible area where increasing interest rates inflationary pressures increases in energy prices could have a potential higher impact than other sectors i think its important to highlight that one area that where we see a lot of pressure in the us in terms of office space i dont we dont have any significant exposure to the office space in puerto rico or the us gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator thank you the next question today is a followup from alex twerdahl from piper sandler please go ahead your line is now open alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co hey i just wanted to ask for the loan growth that you guys are seeing what kind of yields new production is coming in the various categories carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yeah im sorry i dont have that number right now alex we can try to dig it out but i dont have that off the top of my head or in my notes my apologies you can see that the overall yield of loans the overall loan yield of our book did go up basis points indiscernible quarter so obviously we are originating our new vintages ph where you need a higher rate but i dont have the answer to your question well get back on it alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay are you able to give us a little bit more color like if you look in the commercial growth sort of the percentage or just a rough breakdown of what might be the larger corporate customer thats based off indiscernible and we saw some press releases this quarter on sort of pricing that maybe we could apply to that in puerto rico versus what might be more tied to prime carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc that would we the and lidio may be able to correct me that the take up of ph sulfur in puerto rico has been popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc pretty limited carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc pretty slow so i think big picture assumptions for the moment alex is that whatever part of our book is floating its still linked to the old floating rates again the pickup of ph sulfur has been slow so far alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then i just wanted to clarify your comments on the timing for capital return it sounded like you guys go through this process every year where you engage the fed and then a quarter later or four months later you wind up actually telling us what you guys have all decided for the capital return is it the second half of this year that you gave to the fed or do you intend to have an announcement the second half of the year lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc yeah i think our plan would be to do both do we would engage the fed at some point but the announcement i think when we talk about second half of the year it would be an announcement alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay so you engage the fed at some point the next couple of months and realistically july we could still expect a capital update carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc we will make the decision of what we want to do once we have clarity on the outlook for interest rate and the economy alex so that is the starting point so again our guess is that that point in time will come in the summer and that we ended up talking about the second half of the year so thats the starting point and from there we would do our modeling and discuss the opportunities of the alternatives with our regulator we would have to decide how we want to execute anything we want to execute we want to revisit what has been our practice in the past of having very structured every january we have an announcement we may choose to change that moving forward so were going to again the underlying thing we want to do that has not changed which is to move in the direction of our mainland peers plus a buffer but exactly how do we execute that will be revalued and we may decide to execute it in a different path than we did in the past okay so dont assume well be back to getting an announcement and thats it for the year again we may choose to manage our capital return to slightly different moving forward if and when we choose to make a change obviously well discuss it with the market alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 okay but it is the same process that youve gone through theres nothing changing about how often or the regularity that you would engage the fed to include in this and i guess the question that i got from a lot of investors after last quarter is why not go through the process as normal last year and then get approval but just say were not going to implement it as quickly maybe well wait and not do an asr but we have it and the fed is comfortable with our capital levels and all these things that seem exceedingly healthy from the surface carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc you are describing some of the alternatives that we are considering as we revisit how we want to do this i always caution everybody when we speak about this the fed does not give conditional approvals to anything they will only approve things when you request an approval and they will not approve things as long as things work out in the future this way so again we try to manage the fed the best way we can i think over the last four five years weve been pretty effective in our dealing with the fed and will try to continue that but some banks manages it differently some banks have quarterly capital plans that they discuss with the trading instead of yearly capital plan which have been our practice in the past again we want to go and revisit all those alternatives alex to be frank with you so well be doing that when we reengage again we think what weve done in the past has been pretty successful for us as far as dealing with the fed we are analyzing this path that is even better for us and for our shareholders going forward alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay
