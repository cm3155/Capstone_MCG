another strong quarter net income totaled million which includes the effect of an after tax goodwill impairment of million in our us based equipment leasing subsidiary excluding this impact net income would have been million million more than the previous quarter the increase in net income was driven by lower operating expenses and higher net interest income offset in part by a higher provision for credit losses and higher income taxes we grew loan balances by billion during the quarter bppr generated loan growth across almost all business segments reflecting the continued strength of the local economy popular bank achieved growth in commercial and construction loans yeartodate loan balances had grown by billion our net interest margin decreased basis points to in the quarter primarily due to a basis points increase in deposit costs this was partially offset by higher loan balances and the repricing on loans in a higher interest rate environment noninterest income remains solid and continues to benefit from steady customer transactional activity excluding the goodwill charge operating expenses decreased million driven by lower professional fees and customer activity related fees credit quality trends generally remained positive nonperforming loans decreased once again and net charge offs remained well below prepandemic levels while we are beginning to see some credit normalization in the puerto rico unsecured consumer segment we are attentive to the evolving credit landscape and are taking action to address these developments deposit balances at quarter end decreased by approximately million primarily due to a lower level of puerto rico public deposits however average deposits for the period increased by billion also driven by public deposit activities borrowings decreased by approximately million due to the redemption of senior notes during the quarter tangible book value per share ended the quarter at a decrease of per share as net income for the period was offset by an increase in the unrealized losses in our investment portfolio regulatory capital levels remained strong our common equity tier ratio in the third quarter was please turn to slide i am very pleased to highlight that during the third quarter we crossed a significant milestone in puerto rico and now served more than million unique customers utilization of digital channels among our retail customers also remains strong active users on our mi banco platform exceeded million or of our customer base in addition we continue to capture more than of our deposits through digital channel in the third quarter consumer spending remained healthy with combined credit and debit card sales up compared to the third quarter of our auto and lease loan balances increased by million compared to the second quarter as demand for cars has continued to be strong in puerto rico and available inventories have improved mortgage loan balances at bppr increased by million sequentially in the third quarter driven primarily by home purchase activity the puerto rico economy performed well during the third quarter business activity is solid and remains in good shape as reflected in the continued positive trends in total employment and other economic data the tourism and hospitality sector continues to be a source of strength for the local economy there are roughly billion of hurricane disaster recovery infrastructure and pandemic related funds that have yet to be disbursed the pace of disbursement of these funds has accelerated and we anticipate that these funds will support future economic activity for several years as this infrastructure investment and the economy expands we are wellpositioned to serve the needs of our customers and to benefit from such activity in short we are pleased with our results for the quarter particularly our strong loan growth in both puerto rico and in the us as well as the continued strength of our deposit base we are also encouraged by the strong performance of the puerto rico economy we remain optimistic about the future of our primary market and our ability to manage and serve the needs of our growing customer base popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 i now turn the call over to carlos for more details on our financial results carlos j vázquez executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc thank you ignacio please turn to slide we reported net income of million compared to million in  quarterly net income includes the effect of a goodwill charge excluding the charge net income was million million higher than the prior quarter net interest income was million million higher than  on a taxable equivalent basis net interest income was million an increase of million from  due to higher volume of tax exempt investment securities offset in part by higher disallowed interest expenses in puerto rico taxes noninterest income was million essentially flat with  the provision for credit losses was million compared to million in the second quarter total operating expenses were million in  an increase of million from the prior quarter this expense number includes a million pretax and noncash goodwill impairment in our us based equipment leasing subsidiary the goodwill impairment results roughly from two equal effects first a higher discount rate for the projected cash flows resulting from higher rate and equity premiums and second a lower projection of future income presently this subsidiary has lease balances of about million and remaining goodwill of million excluding this non cash expense  expenses decreased by million for the prior quarter the variance in operating expenses was driven by lower professional fees by million in advisory expenses from corporate initiatives primarily related to regulatory compliance and transformation efforts and an million reversal of an accrual related to regulatory examination fees in bppr during  we incurred million transformation related expenses compared to million last quarter our transformation effort is progressing as planned but due to the stage of execution of various major projects the timing of some of the expenses will be somewhat delayed also the decision to use inhouse resources to repurpose previously planned consulting fees into longer term investment or capitalize our initiatives has resulted in a lower than forecasted expense as a result we now expect transformation expenses for to be approximately million down from our prior guidance of million we expect  expenses to be approximately million normalizing for the million noncash goodwill impairment total expenses for would be around billion or million better than our original guidance driven by lower transformation expenses and cost control initiatives undertaken during the year if the proposed fdic special assessment is implemented as presently drafted we estimate popular would incur an additional expense of roughly million we will provide expense guidance including transformation efforts in our january webcast once next years budget is completed our expected tax rate effective tax rate for the quarter was the higher  tax rate was attributable to certain tax benefits recorded in the second quarter offset by lower income before tax for the full year we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be between and please turn to slide net interest margin decreased by basis points to in  on a taxable equivalent basis nim was a decrease of basis points versus  the decrease is driven by higher interest expense on deposits due to increased cost of public deposits and growth in high cost deposit accounts at popular bank this was partially offset by higher loan yields and balances across all major lending categories and higher yields in our cash balances and investments at the end of the third quarter puerto rico public deposits were roughly billion a decrease of roughly million compared to  decrease in  was consistent with historical trends however public deposit balances have remained higher than we had anticipated as such by popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 the end of we now expect public deposits to be in a range of billion to billion compared to our prior expectation of billion to billion excluding puerto rico public deposits customer deposit balances grew were up by million primarily driven by increases in time and saving deposits at popular bank offset somewhat by retail outflows at bppr approximately million of client deposit at bppr were transferred to our brokerdealer during the quarter searching for higher yields ending loan balances increased by billion compared to  driven by growth in almost all loan segments at bppr and on commercial and construction loans at pb yeartodate loan balances have increased by billion versus billion for the same period a year ago we are encouraged by the demand for credit at bppr and pb we will continue to take advantage of funding opportunities to extend credit and improve the use and yield of our existing liquidity our interest rate sensitivity is relatively neutral we continue to expect the margin to resume an upward trajectory in  the timing results from our forecasted loan and deposit growth and mix investment portfolio strategy and the pace of repricing of public and incrementally retail and commercial deposit please turn to slide deposit betas in the current tightening cycle are now above the prior cycle we have seen a total cumulative deposit beta of to date but the rate of increase of deposit cost continues to slow down in bppr total deposit cost increased by basis points compared to an increase of basis points in  led by public deposits excluding the public deposit balances total deposit costs were basis points compared to basis points the prior quarter for a cumulative beta of in the third quarter the cost of public deposits increased by basis points compared to our july estimate of basis points we expect the cost of public deposits to increase by approximately basis points in  the deposit pricing agreement with the puerto rico public sector is market linked with a lag this source of funding results in an attractive spread under market rates at popular bank the deposit costs increased by basis points compared to an increase of basis points in  led by retail deposits gathered primarily through our online channel please turn to slide our investment portfolio is almost entirely comprised of treasury and agency mortgage backed securities which carry minimal credit risk including our cash position this portfolio has an average duration of approximately years in  the unrealized loss of the afs portfolio increased by million driven by an increase of million in the agency mbs portfolio offset in part by a reduction of million in the us treasury portfolio at the end of the third quarter the balance of unrealized loss in aoci of our htm portfolio stood at million a reduction of million from  we expect this loss will be amortized back into capital throughout the remaining life of that portfolio at a rate of approximately per quarter through please turn to slide our return on tangible equity was in the quarter we continue to target a sustainable rotce by the end of driven primarily by higher net income regulatory capital levels remain strong our common equity tier ratio in  of decreased by basis points from  tangible book value per share at quarter end was an increase of per share mostly resulting from increased aoci sorry a decrease of per share given the continued uncertainty on the outlook for rates the economy and the proposed regulatory response to events in the banking sector we will not engage in share repurchase during we do plan however to consider a dividend increase this year we will review future capital actions as market conditions evolve our long term outlook on capital return has not changed anchored on our strong regulatory capital ratios over time we expect our regulatory capital ratios to gravitate towards the levels of our mainland peers plus a buffer popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 with that i turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc thank you carlos and good morning overall popular continued to exhibit stable credit quality trends with low levels of net charge off and decreasing nonperforming loans consumer portfolio however reflected increased delinquencies and net charge off primarily due to the expected credit normalization we continue to closely monitor changes in the macroeconomic environment and on borrower performance given higher interest rate and inflationary pressures we believe that the improvements over recent years in risk management practices and the risk profile of the corporations loan portfolios positions popular to continue to operate successfully under the current environment before discussing the credit metrics for the quarter i would like to address the risk profile of our office commercial real estate exposure and consumer portfolios we have included additional information for these segments in the appendix to todays presentation popular consolidated office cre exposure is limited representing only or million of our total loan portfolio it is mainly comprised of low to midrise properties located in suburban areas and is welldiversified across tenant type with an average loan size of million the portfolio has a favorable credit risk profile with low levels of npls and classified loans in terms of our consumer portfolios these have begun to normalize as expected reflecting increased delinquencies and net charge offs the credit card auto loan and lease portfolios continue to exhibit delinquencies and net charge offs that are below prepandemic levels although gradually increasing in the case of unsecured personal loans however the yeartodate net charge off ratio is which is above the average for the period we are closely monitoring the performance of our consumer portfolio and have made changes to the to our underwriting criteria to decrease exposure to higher risk segments turning to slide number nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans continue to decrease driven by the commercial and mortgage portfolios the decrease in the puerto rico commercial portfolio was aided by the payoff of an million relationship npl inflows also decreased driven by lower contractual inflows in puerto rico and lower commercial inflows in the us offset in part by higher mortgage inflows in puerto rico at the end of the quarter the ratio of npls to total loans held in portfolio decreased to from in the previous quarter turning to slide number net charge offs increased from the prior quarter to million or annualized basis point of average loans held in portfolio the increase was driven by higher consumer and net charge offs in puerto rico mainly in the auto and personal loans portfolio this increase was in part offset by an million recovery from a commercial loan payoff please turn to slide number the allowance for credit losses increased by million to million driven by reserve built up in the puerto rico auto and personal loans portfolio changes in macroeconomic scenarios and loan growth in the us the allowance for credit losses decreased by million due to the implementation of a more granular model for the us commercial real estate portfolio the provision for credit losses was million compared to million in the prior quarter the corporation ratios of allowance for credit losses to total loans remained flat at while the ratio of acl to npl stood at up percentage points from the previous quarter to summarize our loan portfolio continued to exhibit strong credit quality trends in the third quarter with low net charge offs and decreasing nonperforming loans consumer portfolios however reflected increased popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 delinquencies and net charge off due to credit normalization we remain attentive to evolving environment but remain encouraged by the performance of our loan book with that i would like to turn the

support and meet the evolving needs of our growing customer base were now ready to answer your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from timur braziler of wells fargo securities timur the line is yours timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc good morning lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc morning popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc how much hi im wondering how much of the delayed transformation expenses occur in and i guess the total amount of transformation costs is that now lower or is that expense just pushed out ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah i mean some of the expenses have been recharacterized timur so for example as we mentioned some expenses that we expect that to be external consultants were brought inhouse and some of those may end up being capitalizable as last part of the project others have been delayed because the projects have taken a bit longer to get going or whatever the case may be so it will be a combination of some pushed into and others that will not happen anymore we will that what that combination might be will be clear when we complete our project plan for and we complete our budget for and we will provide the guidance on expenses in january as we normally do including both overall expenses and transformation expenses timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess looking at funding cost to what extent are interest rates now done pressuring deposits and the pressure now comes from mix shift carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc well i mean to the extent that you think the fed is done we will continue to have an effect because of the one quarter lag of the effect of public sector deposit costs in puerto rico but most of the rest would probably be result of shift as opposed to base rates changing with the sole exception of the puerto rico public sector which again will have the lag of the third quarter increases into the fourth quarter timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay for those balances just looking at period end over average and then seasonal expected outflows in the fourth quarter those balances of public fund deposits should be materially lower on an average standpoint in is that correct carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc well depends weve updated our range for yearend as you heard from to to to if the balances end up at the high end of that range then the average for the fourth quarter will be not very different theyll be a bit lower than the average for the third quarter but not too much different so it depends on what where we end up in  timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc right and then just last for me on the credit normalization the unsecured pr consumer book the comment about limiting exposure to higher risk segments can you just maybe talk through whats been the greatest source of stress in that portfolio and which segments youre referring to in that comment popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc i would say lower ficos and the overall portfolio indiscernible lower fico segments timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for the questions operator our next question comes from brett rabatin of hovde group brett please go ahead brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc morning everyone ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning brett carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc good morning brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc wanted to start on the expense on back on the expenses in the third quarter and get a little more color if i could on i didnt quite understand the noise around lower regulatory costs most are having higher can you maybe talk a little bit more about the items that reduced expenses in and then how that might change you think in the fourth quarter relative to the million guidance ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah i mean its mostly professional fees brett now thats our professional fees that we hired a consultant to assist us in a whole bunch of different things and the reduction in the quarter was mostly related to some assistance we get on regulatory matters or transformation and things of that sort but this is this was normally this number goes up and down is just that the professional fees number tends to be a lot more stable as opposed to coming down so youll notice the change but in any given quarter the expense in those professional fees can gravitate from advice and regulation to advice on transformation to advice on something else so its just a bit more notable this quarter but it is mostly professional fees the other thing is we do have a reversal of an accrual for regulatory exam expenses that we had accrued overaccrued in that and thats an million in this quarter which obviously also helped the expense number carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 i think its also fair to say that we are challenging our teams to make sure indiscernible as much as possible inhouse versus consulting or using our consultants more intelligently so its not that regulatory costs are necessarily going down indiscernible professional fees and consulting fees are going down brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats helpful and then on the margin as we think about assuming the fed has stopped would seem like the margin would start moving higher with the government deposits not repricing indiscernible three months any thoughts on your willingness or ability to invest maybe some of the cash flow in the securities portfolio into higher rates and just how you see the nii dollars playing out over the coming year ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah the probably the colloquial answer to your question is we have we hope well have to have the decision on the investment portfolio extension because we have enough loan demand that we can put the maturities into loans that would be our preferred outcome that obviously is the best use of our liquidity in terms of margin youre correct i mean to the extent that the fed is done and the pressure on the funding side should be less we are still originating loans that are higher rate level so that should be helpful to margin and the same is true of the investment portfolio whatever is coming due tends to be old treasuries older investments that were at lower rates so that should be helpful as well so the those are the variables there and the math will be whatever the math is brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay and then just lastly for me the rotce target by seems like its possible that that might be achieved a little bit earlier if things line up relative to rates and loan growth any thoughts on timing of that target carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc well the timing we were very specific in our timing it was at the end of and this target is not an easy target so were working very hard to make sure we get there god bless you and hope youre right that we can get there earlier but at this point in time for us it looks like the end of brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay fair enough thanks for all the color ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thanks operator our next question comes from alex twerdahl of piper sandler alex please go ahead alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc hi alex carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc good morning alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co just to expand upon that last question on the rotce target when you guys initially set that out i think it was back in january and one could have assumed or maybe you guys assumed that buybacks to be part of the story this year which theyre not im just curious when you say its unchanged is it just basically saying that reiterating what you said back in back in january or is there an update to the assumptions on capital levels incorporated in the reiterated guidance as well carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc its unchanged alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay so youre not making any changes to your thought around capital levels youre just from when you initially set the target out in january carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc indiscernible assumptions in that number and we the assumptions were not made public well and were not making them public now alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc but theyre unchanged carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc they havent changed yes alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 i want to ask the government deposit question slightly different differently obviously were very focused on the impact to your guys balance sheet but looking at them a different way it seems like theres almost billion of government deposits now that is basically cash that the puerto rican government has to eventually put to work into the economy into the various programs into things that should continue to help the puerto rico picture is that accurate thinking lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc it is but keep in mind that its a very diverse group of depositors its i think we estimate over different deposit clients that have clients ranging from the puerto rico treasury department to the small municipalities most of the agencies had much more money available than they did now some of this money is specifically earmarked for programs so they cant use it indiscernible want but definitely things are happening not only the puerto rico central government but the municipalities are deleveraging which not only means that they have money to spend which means in the future indiscernible have more room to borrow and to do other capital projects if they are good projects so yeah that should be a indiscernible effect but again its agencies with many different programs and that are specifically earmarked so we definitely its obviously good for the economy its good for the economy that the government across the board is deleveraging which is i think is important alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co yeah when you talk about the earmarks are there any like big ones out there that you kind of have line of sight on hitting in the next couple months or years i guess years is too far but next couple of quarters that would make that number change dramatically one way or another ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc no but as we said in the prepared remarks we have seen the pace of disbursement of federal funds increase during the year so at this point indiscernible about billion had been disbursed that compares to billion last year so the pace is picking up we do see a lot of the infrastructure projects will continue to pick up pace theres a lot of projects in the energy sector lot of on the water sector theres a lot of projects theres a lot of highway projects going on a lot of that is still in the planning in the permitting the planning that process we do expect one area will pick up next year will be the indiscernible funds for housing theres a number of projects that have been awarded and those are projects where private developers build in a series of houses and the government will buy those houses from the developer and then later give it to people with vouchers for up to like about theres a number of those projects has been awarded this year were involved in about of those so we should see that activity pick up next year again it takes permitting whatever but those projects have not been awarded so i think youre going to continue to see the basic infrastructure energy highway water and i think youre going to be beginning to see housing pick up next year carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc keep in mind alex that probably more than half of this balance is the actual operating accounts of those 100plus or almost clients so theres always going to be a given balance there that in normal course of business will never go away so the there is that which is will always be there the amounts are earmarked for different projects there are a whole bunch of different things in different accounts for different purposes so it is positive popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 that the government has more cash on hand but it would probably be an understatement to think its anywhere close to billion its a fraction of that alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay yeah thats great and then just expanding on the projects and some of the other things that ignacio you were just mentioning does that result in a larger level of construction disbursements for popular next year that could help to drive loan balances higher ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes definitely i think there should be the residential construction which has been kind of limited that should there should be a pickup in that from those projects again it depends when they actually break ground and they start disbursements again those projects unfortunately or fortunately for will not last very long on our balance sheet because the way it happens is the developer builds the homes and the government takes them out so instead of the take out coming from individual buyers the government takes them out but yes in the short run there should be an increase especially in the residential construction again apart from the government indiscernible were seeing low income tax credits also stimulating certain developments for elderly especially in puerto rico and for indiscernible theres a number of projects that are gaining momentum there i think we should see some of that next year alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co great and then is it fair to assume that mortgage thats been growing for a couple of quarters is that expected to continue just given the obviously where rates are ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah well thats a question i ask weve seen some pick up in the purchase activity but youre right i mean i think weve got to expect that the higher interest rates will have some impact on that i mean thats just basic logic so a lot of the activity as we said in the alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc prepared remarks is purchase activity so thats going to have to be impacted alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co and then final question on loan growth are you guys willing to disclose how much of the highway loan you guys will take down popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes indiscernible i can tell you this the highway deal is very important deal indiscernible from various perspectives one i think it shows a lot of confidence in puerto rico in the sense youre talking about a 40year concession and you had a this is the largest project indiscernible the spanish company has done in the last years and the second largest project theyve done in the history of the company the syndicate of banks that came in was a syndicate of international banks including major japanese banks who have invested in puerto rico projects i think in a while we took the we shared the top lead bank role with one of those large japanese banks and we will be disbursing at closing approximately million and theres another commitment for million going forward for capital indiscernible in the future so our total commitment is around million but at closing well be disbursing million alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co great thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from brody preston of ubs brody please go ahead brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning brody carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc good morning brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i wanted to ask just a followup on the government deposits did i hear you right carlos did you say you expect those the cost of those to increase by basis points in the fourth quarter carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc you heard me right thats our estimate yes brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great and so what is the extra billion of balances sticking around due in terms of nii enhancements relative to if the billion was not if the additional billion was not going to be sticking around like whats the extra nii dollars you get from that popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc well indiscernible have to go with your estimate of what the margin on that business is and multiply by billion because as you know we never disclose the specific indiscernible of the margin on that business but it should be indiscernible brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc indiscernible carlos carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc if in fact the balances end up at the high end of the our updated range it should contribute to nii yes brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc all right youre too quick i was trying to catch you on your feet i did notice that the commercial beta ticked down on the chart that you disclosed and it looks like it was driven by the us business with that beta ticking down from cycletodate to cycletodate as of and i wanted to ask if there was something specific that drove that like a higher balance kind of account leaving that was maybe costly just looking for some color there carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc i mean there was some balance distortion of an account that had larger high cost account that left but that wasnt in this particular quarter this quarter indiscernible costs being relatively flat and then therefore they kind on the last bump in rates that we saw was not kind of passthrough so you got a little inching down in cumulative beta due to that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it so indiscernible brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc commercial beta carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc sorry go ahead brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 do you think that it can continue to kind of level off or do you think that that can with whatever happens with rates going forward do you think youve kind of peaked on the rate offering there and that beta can continue to head lower carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc yeah i mean i think indiscernible more of a stabilization i think that intense pressure that was in deposit cost especially following kind of the mini banking crisis that we saw at the beginning of the year some of those pressures have leveled off and the fact that the rate of increase in fed funds rates again has slowed down so i think all these things help reduce the pressure on that and specifically on the commercial the area where it continues to be a bit more sensitive is kind of like the higher cost retail deposits theres still a fair amount of competition both in our branches and our national online gathering platform brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay i also wanted to ask on the nonowneroccupied cre growth that you had this quarter was that a result of prior commitments kind of funding up or was that kind of new originations and if so can you kind of speak to the geographic location of it was it on the island or was it on the mainland just wanted some more color there ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc i would say its a combination of both i mean we had some growth in terms of our construction portfolio in new york we also have growth nonoccupied growth both in puerto rico and the us puerto rico more in the retail space in the us more in the shelter healthcare sectors brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and then just my last one so i guess i understand that you guys are being cautious around uses of capital but when i step back and kind of do the math on securities restructures for you guys in particular its pretty attractive and its a pretty you kind of quickly accrete cet1 on the backend of it and so within a couple years youre kind of back to an extremely robust cet1 ratio but indiscernible earnings meaningfully which could be beneficial to the stock price so how do you kind of think about securities restructuring and using capital at this point ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc we are aware weve done the numbers we its something that we review periodically one of the indiscernible considerations when were thinking about these things is the fact that if nothing changes and we do nothing we get roughly a third of aoci by the end of next year so that starts when you start comparing not taking execution risk not taking market risk not taking a number of other things and having that outcome it gets difficult to sometimes do alternative things but we have looked at it and we continue to look at it we have not decided that it makes sense for us for the moment brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 got it thank you very much for taking my questions i appreciate it ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you operator our next question comes from kelly motta of kbw kelly the line is yours kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning thanks for the question carlos indiscernible i want to ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc hi carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc good morning lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc good morning kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i want to make sure i got that right so onethird of aoci comes back by the end of next year if no change in rates carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc yeah thats what we thats our best estimate yes that number is consistent with what weve been discussing for the last quarter or so when we did the calculation is roughly probably what i think is going to be kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc pretty fast tangible book value accretion can you remind us what the cash flows are of the securities portfolio and where youre prioritizing that money whether just sticking it in cash youre yielding higher rates versus loan growth versus paying down some of the higher cost borrowings that you have carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc yeah its about billion a quarter still that matures in the bond portfolio and i think this quarter is a nice example where we did everything you mentioned essentially because we mostly funded loan growth which is our preference and then some of the cash also went to repayment of the senior notes now we dont have an popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 immense amount of high cost debt in our balance sheet so that option is not huge but the preference would be to fund client activity to the extent we can and hopefully the demand will be there for that to occur a yeah no in addition to that this is indiscernible again and you could see it on the presentation on page we have around billion worth of like treasury notes and mbs that prepay any given quarter thats being then reinvested at market rates in tbills so you kind of see about billion going off of the indiscernible portfolio and going into short term tbills which currently have very attractive yields and especially that are exempt for puerto rico tax purposes as well so you get that incremental push every quarter kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats super helpful i was hoping i know portfolio loan portfolio purchases or something youve got in the past as things that youre looking at just wondering if theres any update there any appetite or potentially potential changes in what youre seeing in opportunities to add through some of those strategic purchases ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc theres not nothing to update i mean our appetite remains the same if we get shown portfolios of assets that are within our wheelhouse indiscernible geographies and in segments that we like and we think the opportunity well take a very close look at them but we dont have anything to report we are looking and people bring us opportunities all the time sometimes they are outside our credit box or outside of our geographies but yeah we are open and we will continue to be opportunistic if the right opportunity comes our way kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it last question for me and then ill step back i think on prior calls you had said on the fee income side about million to million a quarter was a good run rate and this quarter was really strong if you back out the msr gain youre right in the middle of that just wondering if you could provide an update on what youre seeing on the fee side and any give or take there ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah i mean we still think thats the right range kelly million to million as you know the one of the reasons we like to talk about that range is that any given line in our fees will be up and down every quarter but the summation is actually a lot less volatile than the individual lines so i think that range is still the right range in any given quarter the fees in credit cards may come down or the fees in something else will go up and that may be the opposite the following quarter so they move around a lot but the summation actually is pretty steady stream of business so million to million still looks like the right range for us kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you so much ill step back popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thanks operator operator instructions our next question comes from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard the line is yours ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc hello carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc gerard ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc gerard are you there operator gerard your line is open our next question comes is a followup from alex twerdahl of piper sandler alex please go ahead alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co thanks just a couple of followups just back on the fee comment there are you able to disclose the level or your level of interchange fees in any given quarter ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah we do if the reason for your question is the newly announced proposed changes on interchange debit fees the proposal if implemented as it stands will probably mean something in the neighborhood of million a quarter to us in reduced income alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co you nailed it thats exactly what i was asking and then i wanted to ask a followup on the loan purchase question as well i think a lot of us are paying attention to these fdic the loans that the fdic is selling and a number of them come in in kind of unique structures these jv structures is that something that youd be willing to take a look at or would you only really consider cash purchases ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc no well look at everything i mean the jv structures might produce fee income if it makes sense so wed look at everything were a little bit shy about the sharing losses with the fdic given our prior experiences but well look at everything i mean if the deal is right and its priced right well take a look at it popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co got it all right thanks for taking
