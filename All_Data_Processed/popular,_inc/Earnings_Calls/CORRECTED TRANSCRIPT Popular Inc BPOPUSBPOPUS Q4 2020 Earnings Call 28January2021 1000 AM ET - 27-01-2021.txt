april have improved but are still down significantly compared to last year total nonfarm employment has increased by since april when employment bottomed out but remained below the december level in new auto sales were lower than the previous year mainly a result of the restrictions on auto sales and financing from march through may however demand has rebounded sharply since may and remains robust fourth quarter sales of almost units marked the highest recorded quarterly level going back to at least cement sales increased by in the fourth quarter as compared to the yearago period tourism

they are eligible to do so with respect to the ppp program million of the loans originated were under and are eligible for expedited forgiveness under the sbas simplified process we have deployed an online platform for customers to request loan forgiveness and have submitted approximately million in forgiveness request to the sba leveraging this online platform we began accepting applications for

users on our mi banco platform in puerto rico we captured of deposits in the fourth quarter through digital channels for the fullyear of deposits in ppp were captured digitally compared to in finally our customer base in puerto rico continues to grow increasing by in the fourth quarter to reach more than million unique customers popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 please turn to slide our annual net income of million reflects the decrease of approximately from our annual record net income of million the decrease was largely driven by higher provision expense lower fees and lower net interest income related to the economic disruption caused by the pandemic results benefited from the strong deposit growth and a higher level of earning assets in both puerto rico and the us however both of our branch have lower net interest margins during the year credit quality remained stable throughout we are pleased with how our portfolios have performed in this difficult period our capital levels are strong with yearend tier capital and tier common equity ratios at our tangible book value ended at a increase yearoveryear in puerto rico we grew those by increased our deposits by and our net interest margin was in our us operation we grew those by deposits by and our net interest margin was please turn to slide our quarterly net income of million was million higher than the third quarter and million than the same quarter last year these results were driven by higher revenues partially offset by higher provision and operating expenses including pretax expenses of million related to our new york branch realignment program the increase in net interest income was driven by an increase in our investment portfolio and lower deposit costs credit quality trends were solid in the quarter allinall we are very pleased with our fourth quarter results and with that i will now turn it over to carlos carlos j vázquez chief financial officer popular inc thank you ignacio and good morning before we turn to fourth quarter results i will expand on populars fullyear performance our net interest income decreased by yearoveryear to billion as lowered net interest margins were only partially offset by growth in earning assets provision expense increased by to million primarily driven by the impact of the pandemic noninterest income decreased by yearover year with most segments lowered in again mostly pandemicrelated operating expenses decreased by for the year to billion lower personnel costs and business promotion expenses were the primary drivers our capital position is robust we ended the year with a tangible book value increasing by nearly per share to this improvement was achieved even after the repurchase of our million common stock the increase in our common stock dividend and the redemption of million preferred stock common equity tier ratio dropped by basis points yearoveryear to please turn to slide additional information is provided in the appendix of the slide deck todays earnings press release details variances from the third quarter net interest income for the fourth quarter was million an increase of million from  noninterest income increased by million to million in  more specifically we generated million higher deposit service fees million higher other service fees and million in additional mortgage banking income mainly due to the negative impact in  of the bulk agency mortgage loan repurchase these items were partially offset by million lower gains on sale securities and million lower earnings from portfolio investments held under the equity method to a large extent our non interest income has now returned to prepandemic levels we expect it to continue tracking historical levels provision expense for the quarter was million which is million higher than in  but it includes a reclassification of million for unfunded loan commitments to the provision for credit losses this is only a change in geography in our income statement lidio will expand later total operating expenses were million in the quarter million higher than in  this includes million in the previously disclosed expenses related to popular banks branch closure actions excluding the popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 branch closure related cost and the expense reclassification the net increase in expenses will have been million primarily driven by a million increase in personnel cost composed of a million severance expense related to popular banks branch network realignment higher 401k match due to an additional bi weekly payroll and higher incentive compensation net occupancy expense was million higher due to a million in cost related to the termination of leases associated with popular banks branch realignment professional fees increased by million mainly due to higher advisory expenses and higher processing and technology service cost finally business promotion expenses increased by million due to higher seasonal advertising expenses for the fullyear our average quarterly expenses were approximately million this is million lower than the initial expectation of million in average quarterly expenses we disclosed during our webcast in january of in response to the pandemic we implemented various cost savings initiatives we have targeted million in savings during the year however we ultimately were able to reduce planned expenses by million these savings were focused on compensation benefits and business promotion expenses most of the adjustments were in response to the pandemic and as such many of those savings will revert as the effect of the pandemic wanes for we expect average quarterly expenses to be between million and million while this is higher than the quarterly average we achieved in it is still below our original expense guidance for last year this increase from is mostly driven by higher expenses in the following three categories personnel as we invest in training compensation and related benefits many of the savings in were cost to compensation and incentive pay technology as we continue to modernize our digital capabilities cure obsolescence and address regulatory indiscernible and compliance needs some of these investments were delayed in finally business promotion especially expenses related to client reward programs some of the growth in this category results from our revamped rewards for credit cards and from our digital offerings ph all the higher technology and reward expense are related to expectations of higher levels of client activity in we will strive to come in below this expected level of expenses our effective tax rate for the quarter was for we expect the effective tax rate to be between and please turn to slide net interest income for the quarter was million an increase of million from  the primary drivers of this increase were increased earning asset balances driven by higher levels of deposits in puerto rico the replacement indiscernible in the investment portfolio and lower deposit cost primarily at popular bank deposits grew by million in the quarter this increase was mostly in bppr nim decreased basis points to in  on a taxable equivalent basis net interest margin was also a decrease of basis points the reduction in the margin reflects an increase in the size of the investment portfolio at lower loan yields partially offset by a decrease in deposit cost the total loan yield decreased by basis points in  the bulk mortgage loan repurchase at the end of  was the main driver of this decrease as these assets yield approximately for we expect margin to be stable asset mix round two ppp originations and the speed at which ppp loans are forgiven will drive the ultimate result as of the end of the fourth quarter puerto rico total deposits were roughly billion about million higher than in  we continue to expect total deposit balances to come down over time however in the nearterm additional federal stimulus and tax revenues in the firsthalf of the year would likely increase the deposit balances popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 our average loan balances increased by million in the quarter we expect loan losses will be impacted by ppp forgiveness as well as limited demand fueled by unprecedented levels of client liquidity which may expand further with additional federal transfers round two of the ppp program will help loan balances but we still do not expect overall loan growth to materialize in the firsthalf of please turn to slide our overall capital levels remain strong relative to mainland peers as well as with respect towards capitalized regulatory requirements our common equity tier ratio in  was up basis points from  tangible book value increased by per share to this increase was driven by our quarterly net income offset somewhat by dividend payment our return on tangible equity was in the fourth quarter and for we will continue to pursue our target of maintaining and improving our doubledigit return on tangible equity as discussed last quarter we expect to be able to make capitalrelated announcements in april with that i turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano executive vice presidentrisk management popular inc thank you carlos and good morning overall our credit performance remained stable during the fourth quarter aided by payment deferrals government stimulus and the resumption of collection efforts given the uncertainty caused by the pandemic and the extent of the economic disruption we continue to monitor the impact of covid on our entire loan portfolio turning to slide number we have provided relief to our customer through loan modifications consisting of deferrals forbearance or extensions we granted assistance to approximately customer accounts representing billion of loans or of the total loan balance of customers have exited relief and approximately of these accounts remain current we are attentive to borrower performance across our portfolios but in particular to the postmoratorium mortgage loss mitigation activity and certain sensitive commercial segments please turn to slide number which highlights these commercial segments we think the cre nonretail segment the exposure in puerto rico is mainly comprised of office space while the exposure in the us is mainly multifamily the average original loantovalue in puerto rico is while in the us is office space and multifamily occupancy and collection have remained stable through the pandemic todate there have been moderate numbers of downgrades in this segment of the customers that have exited relief of accounts remain current in the health care facilities segment our puerto rico exposure is mainly to hospitals while our us exposure is to skilled nursing facilities for both regions federal and local assistance have supported the industry operation to date there have been a moderate number of deferrals and downgrades in this portfolio within nonessential retail the shelterinplace orders curtailed activity of this segment notwithstanding our customer base has experienced an increase in activity after the lockdown orders were lifted todate there have been a moderate number of deferrals and downgrades in this portfolio of the customers that have exited deferrals of accounts are current the average original loantovalue for this segment is in general based on discussions with our major borrowers occupancy and collection have remained stable with signs of improvement during the fourth quarter popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 regarding the construction segment most of our exposure is in the us and principally in the new york metro region the majority of our projects are in late stages of completion have low loantocost an average original loantovalue of and nominal exposure to higherend residential todate there have been a limited number of deferral requests and downgrades in this portfolio the pandemic has impacted the hospitality industry with unprecedented challenges the strategies to flatten the curve such as lockdowns social distancing stayathome orders travel and mobility restrictions have significantly decreased the demand for these businesses to address the risk to our loan portfolio we continued to work with our borrowers to give them time to recover and added a qualitative reserve during the quarter our hotel exposure is mostly in puerto rico at the end of the quarter our total exposure stood at ph million with an average original yield loantovalue of this segment has experienced elevated levels of stress due to limited business and leisure travel most of the deferrals expired in the third and fourth quarter but given the challenges of the industry we foresee additional extension to support our borrowers todate there have been a significant number of downgrades and deferrals restaurant balances were million at quarterend this segment has experienced stress driven by the restriction placed on indoor dining despite this restriction the majority of our restaurant borrowers particularly quickservice or fast food have continued to operate through delivery and carryout with volume improvements during the fourth quarter of the customers that have exited deferrals of accounts are current todate this segment has had a significant number of deferrals and downgrades mostly within the indiscernible category to finalize let me highlight that we do not have material current exposure to energy airlines which are ph national credits please turn to slide number to discuss credit metrics nonperforming assets decreased by million to million this quarter mainly driven by an order decrease of million offset in part by an npl increase of million the order decrease was driven by sales and the suspension of foreclosure activity the rising npls was driven by an increase of million in puerto rico due to higher mortgage npls of million offset in part by a decrease of million in commercial npls the increase in mortgage npls was mainly due to a delinquency progression after the expiration of the payment moratorium we are not overly concerned with this due to three factors first npls are comparable to levels prior to the pandemic without the indiscernible outflows caused by foreclosure second early delinquency are at the lowest levels in the last years and finally the trend in popular run rates for early delinquency buckets is encouraging thus everything being equal we do not believe that the fourth quarter increasing npl inflows is a start of a trend but rather the effect of the expiration of deferrals the commercial npls decrease was mostly related to impairment chargeoff from previously reserve collateraldependent loans in the us npls decreased by million due to a previously reserve construction loan that was partially charged off during the quarter at the end of the quarter the ratio of npls to total loans heldinportfolio was flat versus the prior quarter please turn to slide number to discuss npl inflows compared to the third quarter npl inflows excluding consumer loans increased by million driven by an increase of million in puerto rico mainly due to mortgage delinquency progression and the expiration of the moratorium period in the us npl inflows decreased by million as the prior quarter included the impact of our million relationship that matured and reached days following the renewal process turning to slide number net chargeoff amounted to million or annualized basis points of average loans heldinportfolio compared to million or basis points in the previous quarter in puerto rico net chargeoffs increased by million primarily driven by higher commercial net chargeoffs of million mostly popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 related to previously reserved commercial loans in the us net chargeoffs decreased by million primarily related to recoveries in the commercial portfolio the corporation allowance for credit losses decreased by million to million driven mainly by chargeoffs on the previously mentioned commercial loans and an improved economic outlook offset in part by an increasing qualitative reserve as discussed further in the following slide the ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans heldinportfolio decreased slightly to from in the third quarter excluding payment protection program loans and guaranteed mortgage loans this ratio increases by basis points to but the ratio of allowance for credit losses to npls heldinportfolio was compared to in the prior quarter the provision for credit losses increased to million during the quarter we reclassified million of the expense for unfunded loan commitments from other operating expenses to the provision for credit losses excluding this effect the provision for credit losses on the loan portfolio decreased by million mostly due to improvements in the macroeconomic scenarios please turn to slide to discuss details on the drivers of the variance and allowance for credit losses at the end of fourth quarter the allowance for credit losses decreased by million compared to the third quarter variances were driven by changes in economic outlook qualitative reserves and portfolio of credit quality as discussed in the last webcast we enhanced our acl framework by introducing probability weights of different scenarios for estimation process we combined moodys analytics s1 baseline and s3 scenarios among the three scenarios the baseline is assigned the highest probability followed by a more pessimistic s3 scenarios given the uncertainties in the economic outlook and downside risk the current baseline scenario shows improvements in both gdp growth and unemployment rates when compared to the previous estimates the change in macroeconomic scenarios caused the acl to decrease by million during the quarter we added million in qualitative reserve to address specific risks including the exposure to the hospitality industry and the potential risk to the macroeconomic conditions in the puerto rico market portfolio changes driven mainly by credit quality and volume mix caused the acl to increase by million to summarize our loan portfolio exhibited stable credit quality metrics during the fourth quarter aided by payment deferrals government stimulus and the resumption of collection efforts however as the effects of the pandemic continue to evolve and remain fluid the full extent of the economic disruption is uncertain the improvements over the last few years in the risk profile of our loan portfolio positions popular to successfully operate under challenging environments management will continue to carefully monitor the exposure of the portfolios to pandemicrelated risk changes in economic outlook and how delinquencies and net chargeoffs evolve over the next few quarters with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks thank you ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you lidio and carlos for your updates was certainly a challenging year it began with devastating earthquakes in southwestern puerto rico which was shortly followed by the unprecedented impacts of the pandemic including the substantial lockdown of the local economy i am grateful to our employees for their commitment to serve our customers and their creativity and ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment whether on the frontline or adjusting quickly to working from home we are blessed to be part of a team of talented and dedicated colleagues who have met these challenges with courage and ph resiliency popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 we continue to grow our customer base while we remain focused on supporting our communities i am extremely proud of what we have been able to accomplish over the past year we recorded more than million in net income and ended the year on a high note generating one of the best quarters of net income in our history in we were also able to complete our capital plan as intended we executed a million share repurchase program increased our quarterly dividend and redeemed million in preferred stock while there is still much uncertainly especially for the firsthalf of the year i am optimistic that the vaccination process that is underway will allow an eventual return to the normalcy we so desire we begin on a solid footing and excited about our prospects for the year we are now ready to answer your questions question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions operator instructions the first question will be from alex twerdahl of piper sandler please go ahead alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer popular inc good morning lidio v soriano a executive vice presidentrisk management popular inc good morning alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co so first off i was just hoping for maybe some more highlevel thoughts on the puerto rican economy you gave some good numbers in the slide deck but sometimes the numbers dont tell us everything so for example i know weve seen some increase in flows of federal money to the island recently to help rebuild the grid i was wondering if you could comment on whether the hiring has started for those projects yet and then also maybe things like wage inflation and home prices on the island maybe some more anecdotal data ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah you used the word flow i think i mean were generally optimistic that fema finally reached the agreement with the electric power authority for about billion restoration program and with the aqueduct sewer for popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 billion that money really to my knowledge hasnt begun to flow so thats yet to come its important to agree upon that theyre working on implementing that what we have seen obviously the payment has come in as it is in the states thats been coming in the last it began last week and its continued this week so we still have a lot of the cdbg funds that are yet to be spent theyre going out slowly but we are very much more positive it looks like the new administration recognizes that theres been a problem getting these funds out is going to be working closely with the local authorities to get it out faster so i think were going to see that accelerate during the year but we really havent seen it yet so more to come i think the economy like in the states we had a big pickup in the third quarter the fourth quarter was better than before but not quite the acceleration we had in the third quarter i do see home purchases are increasing i saw a report i dont know who put it out so i dont know what indiscernible home purchases in puerto rico went up home prices in puerto rico went up by so generally i think were optimistic that these flow of funds will have a big impact we really havent seen that great other than the direct stimulus that goes to individuals its starting to go out slowly we have a new administration both at the level of the central government and many of the municipalities changed mayors i say that because indiscernible the mayors have a big role in that and including the mayor of san juan so i think that thats probably the number one priority if it isnt it should be but i think theyve all said it is to take advantage of that money what else can i add thats again the money really hasnt begun to flow that much so were hoping that will now begin in the first part of the year alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co when you look at the unemployment or i guess the employment numbers maybe sort of remain and obviously were coming out of a pandemic but they remain kind of stubbornly below million jobs do you think that that money flowing is going to be the ticket to getting the employment numbers above million in a more sustainable basis ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc above you mean above million person yeah definitely alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co yeah million jobs ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc obviously theres a couple of sectors that have been seriously impacted that are high employment sectors the tourism and restaurants sector although they dont make up a huge amount of our gdp they do have a proportion larger impact on employment that sector has been impacted i think when the economy picks up and this wont be so much i mean obviously if the economy picks up business travel picks up but i think puerto rico will be wellpositioned in the leisure market because youre starting to see increasing restrictions on international travel and i think some people will think twice about going to a foreign country for a while if theyre not sure they can get back to the united states the other area that always has a big impact on employment is construction and again if once you start building the infrastructure thats out there i think that will have an impact on employment popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 there are things that worry people in our industry its become generally hard for some people to gain hire employees ive heard people from supermarkets and people that are paying near the minimum wage are having a hard time because in puerto rico the federal supplement for unemployment is a week so if you take a hour a week thats an hour so youre competing against that unemployment so if youre currently unemployed you dont have a big incentive to go out and get a job that pays less than an hour so i do think were going to have a big pickup in the demand side for labor it will be interesting to see how we can meet that supply especially concerning construction industry whether theyll be able to get all the employees they need alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co thats great color thank you for that and then as i think about the reserve and i think about this qualitative portion that was increased in the fourth quarter what kinds of things are you looking for that qualitative portion to kind of reverse is it a full opening of the economy or are there other things that youre paying attention to and then just over time conceptually should the reserve head back towards that cecl day reserve level or is there enough change that that number is kind of moot at this point lidio v soriano a executive vice presidentrisk management popular inc i will say that in general terms the way to think about qualitative reserve is as there is more clarity as to the ph past four i think that will allow us give us more confidence that the need for it has lessened so that would be my first take so as vaccination continues to evolve we see a open up of the economies i think those will be indication for in my view that qualitative reserves might be let go in terms of how to think of the reserve versus day cecl i think i mean there has been significant changes in portfolio composition i mean i think that is a starting point but i wouldnt say that that necessarily we will revert to that that would be my answer alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co perfect thank you for taking my questions lidio v soriano a executive vice presidentrisk management popular inc thank you operator the next question is from brock vandervliet of ubs brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks very much for the question going to slide and maybe followingup on that last question i just wanted to clarify some of these figures because it looks like some of the improvement in the puerto rican macro is pretty material even in your baseline in other words the baselines are improving from  to  if im reading popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 this correctly in addition youve got gdp growth significant in itself next year the year after and in employment it looks like unemployment has dropped in your baseline basis points from the third to the fourth quarter and can you comment on those figures lidio v soriano a executive vice presidentrisk management popular inc i will say some of it has to do with some of the lets go first on employment a part of the change in the unemployment also relates to the difficulty of estimating the unemployment rate when you have significant crisis or significant disruption to the ability of the bureau to do the unemployment survey as you know the unemployment rate is based on a housetohouse survey that in areas of when you have disruption it gets difficult to implement so we for a very long time moodys and economists didnt have the benefit of the march and april numbers and many people thought that those numbers significantly higher than they came out to be thats why you see a significant shift in terms of the forecast for unemployment particularly in puerto rico between the third and fourth quarter baseline numbers that we used the rest i agree i mean there is at moodys in particular they are very high on floor funds for puerto rico particularly i mean the biden administration has a very aggressive plan for puerto rico now that they control both the house and the senate they think that a lot of that is going to come to fruition brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you and shifting to nii and the margin i heard you on margins stable im assuming thats from the fourth quarter loan growth it doesnt sound like we should expect much especially in the firsthalf i guess that points to securities balances how are you feeling about taking up those levels here given the rate backdrop ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah we redeployed about billion of cash in the third quarter into securities longterm securities brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yes yeah ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah we continue to as we get more clarity we continue to consider that doing more of that indiscernible well probably do some more of that in im not dying to extend in the securities portfolio when what were getting is like basis points frankly but its basis points better than basis points right so yeah we will continue to consider that as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we do expect the balances from the government to actually go up especially in the firsthalf of the year a combination of indiscernible transfers and tax revenues coming in and then probably going out in secondhalf of the year popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 so well probably have more cash to invest although some of the cash may be shorterterm i mean some of the things that we have in the radar that were keeping our attention on for example in the government balances is there is a lot of noise let me say in the last couple of weeks that there seems to be progress in the process of restructuring the public debt if in fact that happens and theres an agreement to be implemented sometime later this year i do not know where that will ultimately be but the last agreement that was discussed publicly contained a onetime down payment from the government of puerto rico to bondholders of about billion so theres instances here where significant amounts of the balances ph that depositors make may move out so well have to keep that in mind the new governor in puerto rico has expressed an interest to on their side of the equation to try to move the funds faster as well so there may be additional outflows in normal course of business from the government of puerto rico so well keep looking at all those things but to summarize yes we will continue to consider extending somewhat in the investment portfolio although were not dying to buy assets at yield brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thanks for the color ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc youre welcome operator the next question is from glen manna of keefe bruyette woods glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning glen carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer popular inc good morning glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc ignacio thanks for the color on the economy down in puerto rico and i was just wondering if maybe you could give a couple of specific examples where the federal aid that came down on the island and the billion that was approved previously where bpop has been able to service some clients and maybe take advantage of that money that came down there its just how popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah well again the billion in prepa very little of it has been spent i mean they authorized that but i we have not seen that money for example in our accounts with prepa havent changed dramatically neither with the indiscernible prepa has been going through a program of improving their infrastructure and therefore some of our contractor clients have gotten those contracts and the cdbg mining we have extended lines of credit for several of our contracted clients who need to advance the funds before they get reimbursed on cdbg so again i want to emphasize that while were all very excited about the prospects of the money being released todate the release of those hurricane relief funds have been rather limited so the expectation is its an upside coming we havent really seen that money flow yet theres a lot of talk that they and theres i think a greater disposition on the new administration to get those monies released what weve seen more is the impact on the consumer side where you see the direct relief thats very visible in our deposit balances going up the ppp loans obviously that you see our deposits commercial balances going up also that money for hurricane relief has really again its frustrating for all of us but im determined indiscernible so i look at the bright side which is thats money yet to be pumped into the economy and we have made progress as much as we criticize it these were complicated processes and for example the amount thats been given to awarded to prepa is i think a record amount that fema has ever given to any entity so these are big dollars but again i want to make everyone indiscernible youre not really seeing that money spent yet glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you and carlos thanks for the guidance in the past on the loan growth guidance youve kind of split it up between what you expected in puerto rico and what you expected on the mainland and i was wondering if you could kind of do that again for on what the outlook is carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer popular inc yeah i mean the on both sides i think the outlook is a little bit clouded by billion of ppp loans going away glen so thats what drives the whole thing so if we successfully keep loan balances flat means that we actually indiscernible billion more than matured this year ignacio mentioned the round two of ppp we expect that to help but we also do not expect that to be anywhere close to the magnitude of the original ppp so if anything i think the commentary we have given before will continue to hold true glen which is that were more confident that continued growth in the us bank and in puerto rico probably more stability glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you thank you for my taking questions popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer popular inc youre welcome operator the next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning everyone and how are you carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer popular inc good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning gerard how are you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good i hope its sunny i hope its sunny and down there well im in a snowstorm up here so two different parts of the world ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc indiscernible its beautiful today sorry about that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no surprise you guys are the lucky dogs ignacio maybe you can share with us obviously theres been a change in this administration that were all are obviously aware of and the administration in president obamas administration he was opening up relationships with cuba and then under the trump administration it went in the other direction assuming this administration opens reopens those relationships with cuba can you share with us some opportunities that may arise for popular if youre permitted to do banking down in cuba ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc cuba is always a difficult topic i think that there is a great probability that biden will revert some of the additional restrictions that president trump put in it may take him a while to do so through procedural hoops when obama opened up we were very interested in cuba i think i dont know if you noticed but we were one of only two us banks that issued credit cards that could be used in cuba and it took us a while to get to that popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 however i really dont expect cuba to have a big impact on shortterm really its a people always think from our perspective from the us i mean i dont think youre going to see a meaningful change economically in cuba unless the government there takes a radically different approach to the economy we havent seen signs that thats going to happen so i dont expect anything dramatic to happen i think biden has bigger issues so although i think he will revert some of those things i dont think youll see the level of enthusiasm that you saw when president obama was in power and it was like the beginning of a new era im not that optimistic so really i dont see that much opportunity for us frankly again if it does begin to open well explore like we did last time we invested in time and money to get that credit card operating it wasnt by the way very little use on it so it wasnt a moneymaker so again i dont think its going to be a mover for us in the near future gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you carlos you answered one of my questions with the public deposits on what could draw them down and you mentioned the repayment of some of the debt what would you guys estimate is a normal level of those public deposits once we get to normalcy whenever that is carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer popular inc yeah thats a really good question and we talk about it a lot when you think about that question your normal banker reaction will be oh well lets go back in history and look what the balances looked like before this stuff happened and that must be the right number right unfortunately when we did that that number doesnt work because a lot of the accounts that we have from the government now we didnt have historically because they used to ph stay at gdb and when gdb went bankrupt then a lot of those accounts moved to us so we dont have the historical flows of those accounts so i realize im that giving you a very big range but before gdb disappeared we had indiscernible billions of dollars of government deposits if you add everything up but they were nowhere close to billion i would assume when things normalize that its probably going to be a number somewhere between billion and billion but i cant get any smarter than that big range to be frank with you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you and then just finally i know you cant give us the actual dollar amount of your capital action plans that you plan to announce i think you said april can you just tell us the process because this change is obviously for the dfas ccar banks with the reintroduction of share repurchases with an income limit can you just share with us what your process will be with the fed to announce your capital action plans carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer popular inc sure a lot of the rules that we all know really concentrate are only applicable to ccar banks so while those rules do not necessarily apply to us they sort of set the stage of the it telegraphs to everybody what the fed is willing to consider right conceptually so were watching very attentively what those rules are popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 at this point in time we are planning to continue our process as we have historically ph bernard so gerard im sorry we will gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thats okay technical difficulty carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer popular inc we will call you gerardo hows that we are in discussions with the fed and we go through our whole capital plan with them get their feedback sometimes some adjustments are necessary we still are hopeful that we will get whatever response we may need from them given their response for all the parts sometimes they respond to only parts of this in time for us to make an announcement in our webcast in april so we have not changed our process too much we are mindful of the boundaries that the fed has made public but we have continued our process so far largely unchanged gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you carlos carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer popular inc thank you operator the conference has now concluded
