solid and reflect the strength of economic activity in our markets our diversified sources of revenue and prudent risk management in the third quarter we achieved net income of million or million excluding the impact of the evertec transactions at the beginning of the quarter we closed the previously announced agreement with evertec to acquire key customerfacing channels and to extend important commercial agreements this transaction is already allowing us to accelerate our ongoing digital and business transformation as we focus on the changing needs and expectations of our clients and enhancing the omnichannel experience that we provide please turn to slide our quarterly net income excluding the impact of the evertec transactions was million lower than the second quarter third quarter results were characterized by positive variances in net interest income and fee income offset by higher provision for credit losses and operating expenses the adjusted results for the quarter do not include any equity pickup from our prior investment in evertec during the quarter loan growth was strong and broadbased both geographically and across all loan segments total loan balances grew by billion commercial loan growth in puerto rico was particularly healthy during the period our net interest margin improved in the quarter however we have begun to see a higher cost of deposits particularly in our puerto rico public deposit portfolio in the popular bank credit quality trends remain favorable during the period npls decreased in the quarter and ncos are significantly below prepandemic levels in the third quarter we continue to return capital to our shareholders in july we completed the previously announced million accelerated share repurchase program also upon completion of the sale of our evertec shares in august we entered an additional of million asr which we expect to complete before the end of the year in light of the rapid increase in interest rate yeartodate as well as the uncertain outlook for interest rates going forward in october we transferred billion in intermediate term us treasury from availableforsale to held tomaturity this reduces the impact of oci on tangible capital from future interest rate fluctuations the securities at an accumulated pretax loss of million please turn to slide our customer base in puerto rico grew by approximately in the third quarter to reach million unique customers adoption of digital channels among our retail customers continues to be strong active users on our mi banco platform exceeded million or of our customer base additionally we continue to capture nearly twothirds of our deposits through digital channels this trend remains significantly higher than prepandemic levels and well above our island peers commercial loan growth was strong commercial loan balances of bppr and popular bank increased by million and million respectively auto loan and lease balances at bppr increased by million or versus the second quarter the dollar value of credit and debit card sales of our customers remain stable during the quarter and were above the third quarter in as on the mainland mortgage originations in puerto rico have been impacted by rising rates and limited inventory of available properties the dollar value of mortgage originations at bppr decreased by compared to the third quarter of last year in september puerto rico and florida were impacted by hurricanes fiona and ian respectively hurricane fiona caused a complete blackout on the island and considerable damages to certain sectors in the southwest region popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 while the impact to our operation was not material some customers concentrated in flood prone communities were significantly impacted by the disaster hurricane ian did not have a significant impact on our operations we have offered various forms of assistance to our customers in both regions this includes waiving late payment fees on certain products and waiving atm withdrawal fees for using atms outside of our network additionally we have offered a moratorium to eligible borrowers impacted by the storms we are still evaluating the impact of hurricane fiona and ian however given the low level of assistance request received todate the effect on credit risk should not be significant that said we will continue to work with our customers that were impacted by these events please turn to slide for an update on the current macro environment in puerto rico the local economy continued to perform well during the third quarter business activity has remained solid however certain metrics suggested economic trends in puerto rico while still positive may be moderating somewhat the puerto rico economic activity index for august which is the most recently released data its higher than august and continues to exceed prepandemic levels we remain encouraged by solid employment levels in september total nonfarm employment in puerto rico increased slightly from its level in june the august employment rate of is the lowest ever new auto sales decreased by in the third quarter compared to the same period in but remained above pre pandemic levels the auto industry was disrupted in september by hurricane fiona and continues to be affected by supply chainrelated product shortages despite these challenges there continues to be a robust demand for cars in puerto rico the tourism and hospitality sector continues to be a source of strength for the local economy as puerto rico is a popular destination for mainland residents airport traffic has remained robust yeartodate to september total passenger traffic has increased by compared to hotel demand has also remained strong occupancy rates are up yeartodate and the average daily room rate continues to compare favorably to historical levels in short we are pleased with our results for the third quarter particularly the strong loan growth we are mindful of the global economic uncertainty and market volatility but remain optimistic about the future of puerto rico our primary market and our ability to manage through any potential challenges that may lie ahead ill now turn the call over to carlos for more details on our financial results carlos j vázquez executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you ignacio good morning please turn to slide as usual additional information is provided in the appendix to the slide deck todays earnings press release details various sets from the second quarter net income for the quarter was million early in  we completed the previously announced agreement with evertec in august the corporation completed the sale of its remaining million shares of evertec common stock these transactions resulted in an aggregate aftertax gain of million excluding these evertec transactions  net income would have been million net interest income for the third quarter was million an increase of million from  the variance was driven by higher yield of investment securities as well as higher income from loan growth at both banks this was popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 somewhat offset by higher interest expense on deposits resulting from increased interest rates mainly from puerto rico government deposits and to a lesser extent popular bank noninterest income increased by million to million excluding the million pretax gain from the evertec transactions net interest income for the quarter was million the remaining million variance in noninterest income during the quarter resulted from an increase of million due to the reversal of a contingent consideration related to the purchase price adjustments for last years acquisition of our us equipment finance business during the quarter we also took a charge of million for goodwill impairment on the transaction eliminating the benefit of this reversal we also recorded an increase in other service fees due to higher insurance fees and higher merchant acquiring fees the latter related to the revenue sharing agreement with evertec these were partially offset by a reduction in mortgage banking income due to the runoff of the servicing portfolio and higher losses on closed derivative positions and lower deposit service charges primarily due to the corporations initiative to eliminate or modify account overdraft fees we expect noninterest income to be approximately million in  the reduction from our million to million prior run rate is partly due to three factors that will also have an effect on our run rate first reduced earnings from our portfolio of investments held under the equity method related to the sale of our ownership stake in evertec second lower deposit service charges stemming from the elimination of account overdraft fees and modificationrelated policies and higher earnings credit rate on corporate cash management service lastly in august we decided to retain in portfolio fha insured mortgage originations rather than sell them as we have done in the past as a result our mortgage ph gained wholesale fees will be lower but our tax exempt interest income will be higher in our january webcast well provide updated guidance for quarterly noninterest income the provision for credit losses for the third quarter was million compared to million in the second quarter total operating expenses were million in the quarter an increase of million from  this included million expenses tied to the transaction with evertec and the previously mentioned million goodwill impairment charge related to last years acquisition of our us equipment finance business personnel costs were million higher mostly as a result of the previously discussed market and merit salary adjustments that were effective in july this was a concerted effort to enhance our ability to attract and retain talent credit and debit card processing expenses increased by million due to lower card network incentives and oreo income decreased by million due to lower gain on sale of properties excluding the impact of the evertec expenses and the goodwill impairment charge expenses in  would have been approximately million versus our prior guidance of million in  we expect expenses of million we anticipate that expenses in will be higher than our quarterly run rate driven by continuing increases in personnel technology digital transformation consulting and compliance costs our effective tax rate for the quarter was compared to in the second quarter this decrease was mainly a result of the evertec transactions which are subject to a preferential tax rate the full year effective tax rate guidance remains unchanged at to please turn to slide net interest income on taxable equivalent basis was million million higher than in the second quarter net interest margin increased by basis points to in  on a taxable equivalent basis nim was an increase of basis points the increase is driven by a higher interest rate popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 environment improved asset mix a basis points increase in loan yields and the lag in repricing for government deposits excluding puerto rico public deposit deposit balances declined by million in the quarter mainly from deposits managed through trust division as of the end of the third quarter other deposits were roughly billion an increase of million from  however in the first week in october the puerto rico government transferred approximately billion from the bank to fund pension obligations as part of the plan of adjustment currently puerto rico public deposits at bppr total approximately billion we expect public deposits will end between and billion slightly higher than our previous range our ending loan balances increased by billion or compared to  and are up billion or yeartodate all loan segments were higher in the quarter with commercial loan growth being particularly strong during the quarter we shifted billion of liquidity from fed funds to tbills that currently provide a higher tax effective yield we are encouraged by the demand for credit at bppr and pb we will continue to take advantage of opportunities to extend and improve the use and yield of our existing liquidity please turn to slide yeartodate our retail and commercial deposit franchise in puerto rico has continued to track below its historical beta but these deposits now represent a lower portion of total deposits compared to the last rate cycle as we discussed last quarter during the rapid shift to higher shortterm interest rates going forward the cost of public sector deposits which account for approximately of our total deposits will now move in tandem with market rates albeit with a quarter lag for the fourth quarter we expect the cost of public deposits to be basis points higher as a result of the increase in public sector deposit cost we expect our reported margin to decrease in  before resuming a positive trend in our interest rate sensitivity will be relatively neutral to rising rate scenarios in the coming quarters the majority of the increase in deposit cost is driven by public deposits in puerto rico and to a lesser extent popular bank and commercial excess cash accounts at bppr we will continue to actively manage commercial deposit costs taking into consideration the total relationship with the client please turn to slide we have seen a decrease in fair value of the investment portfolio that is temporary our investment portfolio is basically comprised of treasury and agency mortgagebacked securities which carry minimal credit risk the bond portfolio has an average duration of approximately years as the positions roll down the yield curve their fair value will converge to par and they mark will go down to zero given the rapid increase in interest rates yeartodate as well as the uncertain outlook for interest rates going forward in october we transferred billion of us treasuries in the four to sixyear maturity range from available for sale to heldtomaturity thereby reducing the forwardlooking impact of aoci on tangible book value this action reduced aoci exposure to interest rates by about onethird at the time of the transfer this position had recorded in oci a pretax unrealized loss of million which will effectively be amortized back into capital through the remaining life of the transfer positions at a rate of approximately million per quarter through then tapering off until final maturity the yield on transfer securities remains the same and no losses recognized as a result of this move this transfer does not have a material effect on our liquidity we continue to maintain a large available for sale portfolio in short popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 term treasuries and cash ph at the fed while the changes in the amount of unrealized gains and losses in aoci have an impact on the corporations tangible capital ratios as well as those of the whollyowned bank and subsidiary they do not impact regulatory capital ratios please turn to slide our return on tangible equity was in the quarter benefiting from the gain in the evertec transactions regulatory capital levels remain strong our common equity tier in  was down basis points from  in july we completed the previously announced million asr in total we repurchased million shares at an average purchase price of in august we entered into another asr agreement to repurchase an aggregate of million of populars common stock the full impact is already reflected in our capital balance the combined effect of the asrs during the year increased our eps in  by per share tangible book value at quarter end was per share a decrease driven mostly by higher accumulated unrealized loss on debt securities available for sale of million a result of higher interest rates and the impact of the asr and the dividends during the quarter these were partially offset by the quarterly net income given the uncertainty in markets including the volatility in interest rates which impact our tangible capital levels we have decided to temporarily delay additional stock repurchase activity beyond the current asr we will maintain the current level of dividend and plan to revisit future capital actions in the second half of once we have more certainty around the outlook for interest rates and the economy as a result we do not intend to announce new capital actions in january webcast our ph perspective in capital return has not changed anchored in our strong regulatory capital ratios over time we expect our regulatory capital ratios to move towards the levels of our mainland peers plus a buffer to account for our geographic concentration in puerto rico with that i turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc thank you carlos and good morning overall popular continue to exhibit stable credit quality trends with low levels of net chargeoffs and increasing nonperforming loans we continue to closely monitor changes in borrower performance and the macroeconomic environment given potential economic headwinds rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty however we believe that the improvement in the risk profile of the corporations loan portfolios positions popular to operate successfully on the more difficult economic conditions the impact of hurricane fiona and ian is still being evaluated but given the hurricanes limited impact in the markets we do business and the low levels of assistance requests received todate the ph effect on credit risk should not be significant turning to slide number nonperforming assets decreased by million to million this quarter driven by an npl decrease of million the decrease in npls was mainly in puerto rico driven by lower mortgage npls by million and lower commercial npls by million in part offset by higher order npls by million the increase in auto npls was due in part to hurricane fiona as we stopped collection activity during the last two weeks of the quarter in the us npls increased by million mainly due to an million healthcare relationship that was placed in nonaccrual status during the quarter compared to the second quarter npl inflows excluding consumer loan popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 increased by million driven by the us healthcare relationship previously mentioned offset in part by lower mortgage inflows in puerto rico at the end of the quarter the ratio of npl to total loans heldinportfolio was compared to in the previous quarter turning to slide number net chargeoffs amounted to million or an annualized basis points of average loans heldinportfolio compared to million or basis points in the prior quarter the results for the quarter were impacted by a million chargeoff of a pharmaceutical manufacturing relationship and by the lack of collection activities in puerto rico during the last two weeks of september the corporation allowance for credit losses increased by million or to million driven by higher loan volumes changes in credit quality and an million in specific reserve recorded for the previously mentioned healthcare commercial npl inflow the ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans heldinportfolio remained flat at the ratio of allowance for credit losses to npls heldinportfolio was compared to in the prior quarter the provision for credit losses was an expense of million compared to million in the previous quarter reflecting the changes in the allowance for credit losses and the net chargeoff activity in puerto rico the provision for credit losses was million compared to million in the prior quarter while in the us the provision was million compared to million please turn to slide number as discussed in prior webcasts we leverage moodys analytics for the us and puerto rico economic forecast notwithstanding persistent high inflation increases in interest rate supply chain constraints and general uncertainty moodys analytics nearterm baseline outlook remains for the us economy to continue recessionfree our framework assigns the highest probability to the baseline scenario followed closely by the more pessimistic recession scenario s3 the quarteroverquarter change in acl was driven by loan portfolio growth and increases in specific reserves offset in part by continued strength in puerto rico employment forecast and changes to the period popular utilizes to revert its macroeconomic forecast to historical levels to summarize our loan portfolio continued to exhibit strong credit quality metrics in the third quarter with low net chargeoffs and decreasing nonperforming loans we remain attentive to the evolving environment but believe that improvements over time in the risk profile of the corporations loan portfolio positions popular to operate successfully under more difficult economic conditions with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you lidio and carlos for your updates our results for the quarter and yeartodate have been strong driven by solid earnings robust loan growth stable credit quality and continued customer growth were aware of potential challenges stemming from inflation higher interest rates and market volatility yet remain optimistic about opportunities in puerto rico our main market consumer activity continues at healthy levels and recovery funds from previous events are expected to provide additional stimulus with strong fundamentals prudent management and diversified sources of revenue we are well positioned to leverage these opportunities and address any potential challenges that may arise in addition to our financial results im extremely proud about our teams response in the wake of hurricane fiona thanks to their agility and resolve we mobilized quickly to assist communities in need serve our customers despite popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 operational challenges and support impacted employees our colleagues performance in such events evidences our unwavering commitment to all the important stakeholders we serve we are now ready to answer your questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now start todays qa session operator instructions our first question today comes from alex twerdahl from piper sandler your line is now open alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co first i wanted to ask about your comments on the delaying of the capital actions until the second half of im just curious if the whole exercise you go through with the fed that i think was supposed to take place around this time if the whole exercise gets delayed by six months or if youre ongoing that right now and kind of have to go through the plans and then you just wont announce anything until the second half of next year carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah no the normal process we go through with the fed is completed we have completed our stress test and everything else so the biggest part of that process so that is done it is convenient when we talk about our capital actions close to finishing the discussions because its the freshest stress test so i think theres a reasonable chance to we talk to them about it in the second quarter theyll ask us to refresh it or something like that but maybe not you never know the one we continue already maybe good enough we respond normally to updates request from the fed this will be no different alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just as it relates to the timing of the transfer from afs to htm is that correlated to completing the stress test and as you think about tce historically it hasnt really mattered and maybe it still doesnt given the amount of regulatory capital you have but im just wondering if theres kind of a floor that either you have internally or that the fed has suggested upon you that we should be aware of popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc no it is not correlated at all it was a separate decision as we are working through it to get implemented we ended up implementing what we did which was the beginning of the fourth quarter its not correlated whatsoever and we have not received any comments from the fed on tangible capital whatsoever alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks for that and then carlos i just wondered if you could clarify the guidance on expenses i think you said million for the fourth quarter and then should be a higher than the quarterly run rate is that the average quarterly run rate for that it should be higher then is it the back two quarters how does the profit sharing whether we get it or not factor into that guidance just so were all on the same page and theres no big surprises in the second half of next year carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc no what i said is higher than our current run rate so its not the average priority for the year with our current run rate alex alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay so the average starting point should be around million youre going up from there and then a profit sharing comes in the second half of next year then that will be added on to that current run rate carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah i mean profit sharing as you know we have to outperform our budget for that to kick in so that normally doesnt happen until in the latter part of the year the only difference this year is that it was reasonably clear we were going to outperform earlier in the year and thats why we spoke about it in the second quarter typically in the fourth but again it is a program that is intended to share outperformance so we always hope we get there because that means everybody is doing better including our shareholders but that is not part of the indiscernible no alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks for taking my questions operator our next question today is from timur braziler from wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning my first question is around net interest margin maybe for carlos and your commentary that will decline in the fourth quarter and then should trend higher in how should we be thinking about the government deposits repricing post the last rate hike is it going to be the same 90day lag for one quarter out popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 that will kind of stabilizes or just given the larger balances there and the more turnover it might take a couple of more quarters it just seems like its going to be hard for nim to outperform while that book catches up carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc i mean its not exactly days it was pretty close to days and as you can see from our commentary for next quarter the increase in fed rate business in the third quarter was million so thats what we expect the increase in government deposit to go up next quarter so conceptually if the increase in the fourth quarter is million then that would carry over to the first quarter of next year and so on and so forth then the lag the benefit this quarter we had talked about the lag helping as rates start to go up but then as long as the rate of increases is constant it will just catch up one quarter later timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so one quarter following the last rate hike thats a kind of ph flesh through the system got it and then that billion in public funds is that an average number or is that end of period carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thats end of period and again as of now the number is billion so its already down from that end of quarter number timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and maybe you can provide us kind of a low point and a high point for the quarter and im just wondering if the increased government activity and kind of growth from here translates to a larger and growing balance within those accounts or you still have good visibility that those balances are ultimately going to come down carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah i dont have the peak and the low balance for the quarter but again our best estimate right now given the information we have from the government and again keep in mind that the government is not one entity as we have over accounts that make up the government deposit balances so sometimes it is hard for them to have ph visibility but our best guess right now continues to be that well end of the year at balances between billion and billion what has changed from that range is that last quarter we had a range of billion to billion and we just dont think the lower range is going to happen anymore we ph havent increased the upper part of the range but our estimates still theres going to be somewhere between billion and billion timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then maybe one for lidio can you provide any additional color on the us healthcare loan that went nonperforming during the quarter popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc it is i mean nonsystemic i mean just one case of a customer that had some financial difficulty but not at all systemic of the real health of our portfolio timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful and then just it looks like broader credit landscape is starting to normalize somewhat were seeing consumer chargeoffs kind of go higher are we entering a period of normalizing asset quality and then i guess in that kind of context should we be assuming a similar level of provisioning as we do enter that period of normalization or i guess is there additional room to kind of take down allowance even as were staring at a recession in the mainland lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc i would say i mean there is ph such a thing has a good provision i think this was the case this quarter because a lot of it was driven by growth not necessarily the credit environment i think its too early to tell i mean we still have impacts of fiona in terms of some of the numbers so you had a little bit of higher chargeoff because of fiona a little bit of a higher npls because of fiona so we still feel that we are the credit picture is very strong very good and the numbers for the third quarter were very very very good for the organization timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you for the color lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc thank you operator our next question comes from brett rabatin from hovde group please go ahead brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning everyone ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning brett brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc wanted to go back to the capital action question and if i understand correctly your commentary the fed did not tell you to wait and my question specifically is lets say the bond market changes and we have some sort of different environment than we presently do that would change your tangible book from here maybe earlier than the second quarter could that alter your decision process i mean i look at the adjusted tangible book here at popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 over and your stock immediately drops to after you mentioned the change in the capital plan any color around that ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well this is ignacio i want to make absolutely clear that this decision was not related to the fed it was not requested by the fed this was a decision made by us we felt probably it was prudent given the environment and also take into account that as opposed to other banks that have actually paused buybacks were still buying back our shares to the asrs as we speak so it had nothing to do with that we wanted to give you a timetable because thats what we think its a reasonable time to expect and thats what were thinking were going to look at the world changes dramatically theres nothing written in stone that we couldnt revisit that earlier brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay fair enough and then on around the margin commentary theres maybe a little more complicated relationship for figuring out the margin than some banks with the government deposits so to speak could we maybe take it a different direction and just think about total nii dollars and as i look at it it kind of seems like your absolute dollars of nii could decline somewhere between million and million linked quarter do you think thats a fair way to think about the fourth quarter levels or would you point me to a different number carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc well that will depend on what youre penciling in for loan growth and what rates youre putting in for the new loan production brett the nii right but the calculation on the increased cost shouldnt be very complicated is whatever balance you have or you expect to have in government deposits plus basis points from where they are today so if that number comes out to be an additional million then that ph should number is brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay fair enough thanks carlos and then maybe one last one i think thematically the banks and puerto rico and bpop specifically have a big advantage to a lot of the mainland banks obviously the government deposits are more price sensitive but generally speaking your deposit beta as you even illustrate in your slide deck are much lower than the mainland and that would presumably continue to be at least the case going forward but just wanted to maybe step back and just think about the balance sheet in the loan growth do things change from here from higher running the sheet or will you continue to have the same sort of path carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc no i mean weve seen very good loan growth this year maybe even a little bit better than we expected its definitely sooner than we expected you remember we were guiding to that loan growth wouldnt happen until the second half of the year and they actually started happening in the very first quarter of the year so loan growth has performed maybe a little better than we expected we have done on the balance sheet exactly what you would expect us to do when that happens ph we saw reducing investment portfolio and redeploy it to loans that are the perfect thing for us that we would like to do more we are still very positive on popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 loan growth for the rest of this year and next year so were i hope we can do more of that as next year comes along now so directionally if what i just said pans out what you should see in the balance sheet is a continued gradual reduction in investment securities okay and our investment portfolio should start to gravitate to more normal levels if you look historically at popular our investment portfolio has represented something in the high percent of our total assets as opposed to of total assets so i would hope that we can start the path in that direction next year we would definitely rather have loans and relationships than investment in treasuries if we can have them brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay appreciate all the color carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you operator our next question today comes from kelly motta from kbw your line is now open kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi thank you so much for the question i just wanted to circle back on that slide you gave on deposit betas i found it really helpful just wanted a point of clarification when you give the historical betas for the nonpublic funds whether that is an interest bearing deposit beta or a total deposit beta and how you expect those to theres an argument to be made that deposit beta should be higher than what weve seen historically given what were seeing with the mainland banks so just wondering what you guys expect for kind of the core deposit beta run rate carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc okay what we have here is in on the chart is historical betas for the last rate cycle increase kelly so it is historical as was mentioned earlier in the call our historical betas have been lower than they typically are for peer banks of ours in the states and that continues to be true this year what is different of course is the mix we have a lot more government deposits now than we had in the last rate hike cycle on your question on whether they will remain the same so far were tracking well there is a lot of discussion from very wellinformed analysts that they expect betas in this cycle to end up accelerating or being a bit higher than they were last time simply because of our reaction to the rapid rate of increases in rates being so quick i think theres some merit to that discussion we havent seen it yet but of course we wont see it until the cycle is over so at this point in time were performing well within historical trends and if at the end of the day the whole market start ends up in ph higher betas we would hope that at least in our puerto rico bank well still remain below the market betas kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 okay thats helpful and then with your margin guidance for margin to contract sequentially in does that factor in the public deposit guidance you gave of those coming down and what would happen to your margin if for whatever reason those ended up hanging in at similar to the current amount that they are now carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah well if you put together a couple of our comments the first comment that we expect balances in public deposits will be end up between million and million for year end so that sort of implies that we expect the balances to be sort of around where they are now so that commentary incorporates maybe some reduction in balances but not a huge reduction in balances it does not incorporate an increase in balances and thats what were to happen and the commentary on margin does include our expectation of increase of basis points in cost of those deposits yes kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks ill step back operator operator instructions our next question today is from gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good morning everyone this is thomas leddy calling on behalf of gerard circling back to loan growth another strong quarter have you guys seen any new entrants into the market for lending perhaps from mainland banks that werent as active there maybe a year ago i mean i know you guys always compete with them but maybe any changes that you can speak to ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc no not really we havent seen any new entrants i think you may see some of it down the road for some of these big infrastructure projects that havent been done yet but in the breadandbutter commercial loan we have not seen any new entrants or significantly heightened levels of competition from nonus banks thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you and you mentioned in your presentation an increase in auto loan ncos in the quarter i mean with the acquisition a few years back of the wells auto portfolio you guys are obviously a bigger auto lender on the island are you in puerto rico seeing the used car price inflation that weve seen in the states and then can you share with us your outlook for credit quality in that space as we head into next year lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc we have seen an increase in used price the same as we have seen in the mainland in puerto rico so that is i mean we see it through the lower or higher realization in the indiscernible i mean our outlook i mean we continue to be performed much better than we had prior to the pandemic with lower early delinquency lower npls and lower chargeoff across most of our portfolio but also in the auto loan portfolio i mean we still popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 feel like given the level of liquidity of our client base despite the economic activity in puerto rico that should continue to perform well on a going forward basis thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great thank you for taking my question operator our next question today is a followup from brett rabatin from hovde group your line is now open brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey thanks for the followup i was going to ask you about auto but you just addressed that so maybe just one followup around the pipeline as you guys see it i mean loan growth continue to be better than expected and but looking at the economic data and its holding in there pretty good is the pipeline lidio or carlos is that actually improving relative to maybe the past quarter or what would you say about the loan pipeline relative to where it was earlier in the year ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc this is ignacio but i would say that its about the same weve had good loan demand starting in the second quarter obviously ive said this before some of our corporate business ph potentially is lumpy so youre never sure whats going to fall one quarter or the other but i still see good loan demand across sectors in puerto rico in every quarter you may get a bigger loan or a smaller loan that changes the balance and also sometimes the payoffs can come in heavy in one quarter later and lighter in the other but in terms of loan demand were seeing it steady i mean i have not seen any decrease for the loan demand so far brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay and then maybe one last one if i could just around you talked about the puerto rico environment and it would seem like us it would be good opportunity for whats happened with fiona to really for wilma to really kind of improve a lot of things in its operation but ive not heard good things any thoughts around wilma and just what you guys are hearing or are seeing from the ground level in puerto rico around electricity production and how that might possibly improve in the next year ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc i dont know the next year the cycle i would say but i think if theres ever a silver lining to something like fiona any of that and i think the federal government has especially noticed that the recovery efforts from maria were much too slow and theyve created a task force to work on energy theres a lot more emphasis i think theres a lot more people understand that really we have to pick up the pace and recently fema announced that it not necessarily tied to electricity situation but they were going to upfront of the cost of the project normally fema works like an insurance company where they reimburse you and part of the problem in certain jurisdictions like ours which could be ph catastrop its hard to come up with that so i think popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 were going to see is a lot more focus and wilma is under a lot of pressure to perform and i think the federal government is under a lot of pressure also to show progress in this front so i think the pace will accelerate and thats the brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc brett thats the silver lining for fiona i think brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay great and appreciate the color operator our next question is a followup from timur braziler from wells fargo your line is now open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thanks for the follow up just two more questions for me im just ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc we cant hear you timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc is that better can you hear me ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc that is a lot better thank you timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi sorry yeah so two quick follow ups for me maybe starting on the fee income guidance of around million its a pretty large step down from this quarter im just wondering is that majority coming from gain on sale and then as far as the revenue sharing component that started hitting this quarter is that the full quarters impact and kind of what is that run rate look like for the evertec revenue share carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah well this quarter has a couple of unusual things in that number the million connected to our us equipment finance company is in that number so the million is not exactly run rate so if you adjust for popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 that were back to the run rate we were always referring to million to million the million were talking about here theres a couple of differences first of all is one that its pretty clear whats happening we dont have an equity pickup from evertec anymore and that was about million to million a year a quarter sorry so that affects that number and then the other factors i mentioned will affect the number as well moving forward so ill just disagree with the statement its a big change because the number when you take unusual things happening in the number for this quarter out this quarter was pretty much in line with prior items timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay now thats a fair statement and then just last for me on the goodwill impairment for k2 i guess what drove that and the acquisition hasnt been on your books for that long maybe just some color on what drove that impairment carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah its your typical goodwill exercise the acquisition was not exactly meeting the budget the way we thought they would and that leads to an adjustment in the goodwill to some extent luckily we had structured the deal in such a way that there were a lot of contingent payments linked to that performance so those contingent payments went away as well so at the end of the day the effect of those two things cancelled out and didnt have an effect on the performance for the quarter so it was just a matter that they are a bit slower than we expected to meet their targets it locally has picked up lately so we hope theyll make up some of that grabbed timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you for the color i appreciate it carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc youre welcome operator our next question today is from alex twerdahl from piper sandler your line is now open alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co just a quick followup question on the loan growth i was wonder if you could give us some color on the granularity of the commercial loan growth that you saw both in puerto rico and in the mainland if theres any like really big chunky loans in there carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah in puerto rico we had a one large loan in the hospitality sector other than that i think its pretty much typical stuff so i think the only thing that i would say that on both markets that come to mind right away so we did have a large loan in puerto rico in the hospitality segment popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co have you any line of sight on any other sorry carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc i would say thats effective thats performing very well and theres a lot of interest both online and offline in that sector right now alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co yes do you have any line of sight in any other big chunky loans like that that could be potentially coming on over the next couple of quarters carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc not perhaps that size but we have some nice loan prospects were following up on that ones probably bigger than normal the one i just mentioned but we have some nice ones in the pipeline but that one to be honest probably a lot a little bit bigger now than we normally do alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just im sorry if i missed this but the slide that has the complexion of retail versus commercial versus public sector deposits can you give us the distribution of the noninterestbearing relative to the various sectors lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc we dont have that here well have to work on that alex we dont have broken up exactly that way as you can see foreign financials we typically break up deposits by product as opposed to by segment so well come up with information but we dont have any right on the pack here alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay is there any one of those i mean would it be fair to say that public sector deposits dont have very much interestbearing lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc no both of the deposits alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co or noninterest bearing popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc im sorry oh im sorry for interrupting the opposite alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co theyre all interestbearing okay and the and the commercial and the retail if you i mean if you were just guessing would it be a rough equal split lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officer popular inc i dont want to give you a number off the top of my head alex the best we can do is obviously you have a slide and turn to slide page it gives you the melded beta of the interestbearing and noninterestbearing so but well look into it to see if we can address your question alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks for taking my followups operator there are no further questions at this time i would now hand you back over to ignacio alvarez for closing remarks
