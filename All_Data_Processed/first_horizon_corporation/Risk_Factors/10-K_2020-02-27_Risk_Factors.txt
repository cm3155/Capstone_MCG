item risk factors first horizon national corp form 10k annual report this item outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our various businesses to compete change our risk profile or materially impact our operating results or financial condition our operating environment continues to evolve and new risks continue to emerge to address that challenge we have a risk management governance structure that oversees processes for monitoring evolving risks and oversees various initiatives designed to manage and control our potential exposure this item highlights risks that could impact us in material ways by causing future results to differ materially from past results by causing future results to differ materially from current expectations or by causing material changes in our financial condition in this item we have outlined risks that we believe are important to us at the present time however other risks may prove to be important in the future and new risks may emerge at any time we cannot predict all potential developments that could materially affect our financial performance or condition first horizon national corp form 10k annual report table of item topics

table end table start traditional competition risks table end we are subject to intense competition for customers and the nature of that competition is changing quickly our primary areas of competition for customers include consumer and commercial deposits commercial loans consumer loans including home mortgages and lines of credit financial planning and wealth management fixed income products and services and other consumer and commercial financial products and services our competitors in these areas include national state and nonus banks savings and loan associations credit unions consumer finance companies trust companies investment counseling firms money market and other mutual funds insurance companies and agencies securities firms mortgage banking companies hedge funds and other financial services companies traditional and otherwise that serve the markets which we serve the emergence of nontraditional disruptive service providers see industry disruption beginning on page has intensified the competitive environment some competitors are traditional banks subject to the same regulatory framework as we are while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation longstanding examples of lessregulated activity include checkcashing and independent atm services a recent example of unregulated activity is socalled peertopeer lending where investors provide debt financing andor capital directly to borrowers we expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products and services heightened competition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affected items upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs or both for additional information regarding competition for customers refer to competition within item beginning on page of this report we compete for talent our most significant competitors for customers also are our most significant competitors for top talent see operational risks beginning on page of this item for additional information concerning this risk we compete to raise capital in the equity and debt markets see liquidity and funding risks beginning on page of this item for additional information concerning this risk table start traditional strategic and macro risks table end we may be unable to successfully implement our strategy to grow our commercial and consumer banking businesses and our fixed income business although our current strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions change at present our strategy is primarily to invest resources in our banking and fixed income businesses growth is expected to be coordinated with a focus on strong and stable returns on capital in the past four years we have mixed organic growth with tactical acquisitions and a strategic acquisition capital bank in we expect to close a tactical acquisition of bank branches and a strategic mergerofequals with ibkc first horizon national corp form 10k annual report organically we have enhanced our market share in our traditional banking markets with targeted hires and marketing expanded into other southeast us markets with similar characteristics and expanded with commercial lending and private client banking in the houston texas market we have made similar moves in our fixed income business in the future we expect to continue to nurture profitable organic growth especially after we combine and integrate the branches and ibkc with our existing banking centers and operations we may pursue other acquisitions if appropriate opportunities within or outside of our current markets present themselves failure to achieve one or more key elements needed for successful organic growth would adversely affect our business and earnings we believe that the successful execution of organic growth depends upon a number of key elements including table start our ability to attract and retain customers in our banking market areas table endtable start our ability to achieve and maintain growth in our earnings while pursuing new business opportunities table endtable start in our fixed income business our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same time identifying and successfully executing upon opportunities to provide new or existing products and services to new or existing customers table endtable start our ability to maintain a high level of customer service while optimizing our physical banking center count due to changing customer demand all while expanding our remote banking services and expanding or enhancing our information processing technology compliance and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently table endtable start our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with growth especially organic growth and cashfunded acquisitions and table endtable start our ability to manage effectively and efficiently the changes and adaptations necessitated by a complex burdensome and evolving regulatory environment table end we have in place strategies designed to achieve those elements that are significant to us at present our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them or adopt new strategies as conditions change failure to achieve one or more key elements needed for successful business acquisitions would adversely affect our business and earnings to the extent we engage in bank or nonbank business acquisitions including the two currently pending we face various additional risks including table start our ability to realize planned or hopedfor strategic and tactical objectives including operating efficiencies table end and revenue synergies within a reasonable time period after closing the transaction table start our ability to identify analyze and correctly assess the execution credit contingency and other risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately table endtable start our ability to properly evaluate loss inherent in the target business loan portfolios table endtable start our ability to integrate the acquired business operations customers and properties quickly and costeffectively table endtable start our ability to manage cultural assimilation risks associated with growth through acquisitions which can be an oftenoverlooked and oftencritical failure point in mergers table endtable start our ability to combine the franchise values of the two companies without significant loss from rebranding and other similar changes and table endtable start our ability to retain core customers and key employees table end in fourth quarter we rebranded our businesses and began rebranding our banking centers that effort makes us somewhat more sensitive for a time to the risk that customers will experience confusion or branding fatigue which may be exacerbated in when we complete the rebranding of our banking centers convert the acquired branches and begin to convert ibkc businesses and locations to the first horizon brands fortunately some of the branches and most of ibkcs branches do not overlap with our banking center markets which should help mitigate ill effects a type of strategic acquisitiona socalled merger of equals where the company we nominally acquire has similar size operating contribution or valuepresents unique opportunities but also unique risks those special risks which are present in the ibkc transaction include table start the potential for elevated and duplicative operating expenses if we are unable to integrate the two companies efficiently in a reasonable amount of time and table endtable start the potential for a significant increase in the time horizon that may be needed before substantial economies of scale can be realized or substantial revenue synergies can be developed effectively table end first horizon national corp form 10k annual report table start industry disruption table end through technological innovations and changes in customer habits the manner in which customers use financial services continues to change at a rapid pace we provide a large number of services remotely online and mobile and physical banking center utilization has been in longterm decline throughout the industry for many years technology has helped us reduce costs and improve service but also has weakened traditional geographic and relationship ties and has allowed disruptors to enter traditional banking areas through digital marketing and service platforms many banks are making customer inroads unrelated to physical presence this competitive risk is especially pronounced from the largest us banks and from onlineonly banks due in part to the investments they are able to sustain in their digital platforms companies as disparate as paypal an online payment clearinghouse and starbucks a large chain of cafes provide payment and exchange services which compete directly with banks in ways not possible traditionally the nature of technologydriven disruption to our industry is changing in some cases seeking to displace traditional financial service providers rather than merely enhance traditional services or their delivery a number of recent technologies have worked with the existing financial system and traditional banks such as the evolution of atm cards into debitcredit cards and the evolution of debitcredit cards into smart phones these sorts of technologies often have expanded the market for banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those services away from banks and disrupting prior methods of delivering those services but some recent innovations may tend to replace traditional banks as financial service providers rather than merely augment those services for example companies which claim to offer applications and services based on artificial intelligence are beginning to compete much more directly with traditional financial services companies in areas involving personal advice including highmargin services such as financial planning and wealth management the lowcost highspeed nature of these roboadvisor services can be especially attractive to younger lessaffluent customers and potential customers as well as persons interested in selfservice investment management other industry changes such as zerocommission trading offered by certain large firms able to use trading as a lossleader may amplify this trend similarly inventions based on blockchain technology eventually may be the foundation for greatly enhancing transactional security throughout the banking industry but also eventually may greatly reduce the need for banks as financial depositkeepers and intermediaries we believe that over the course of the technologydriven evolution of our industry which is well underway the winners will be those institutions which can know their customers and make those customers feel they are known even when many customers increasingly do not visit banking centers or have facetoface live interaction two keys to achieving a psychological connection with such customers are data management and analytics using artificial intelligence processes which allow an institution to provide a differentiated personalized experience for the customer at the point of interaction and seamless integration of realtime customer contact with a human being through voice chat or otherwise a critical factor in successful data analytics allowing realtime differentiated interaction with customers is how traditionally uncaptured unstructured or siloed data is acquired managed and accessed some banks are experimenting with different methods of addressing this business need and more will follow in addition external vendors are developing processes to provide solutions a basic challenge for all these efforts is how to integrate analysis of extremely disparate forms of data and utilize that analysis in each customer contact in a manner which most customers not only accept but value developing workable proprietary solutions to the data analytics challenges ahead of competitors requires substantial investment in information technology systems and innovation even with a substantial it budget we cannot outspend or even come close to matching the largest us banking institutions therefore like most us banks our strategy must be focused on leveraging products and solutions which are within our means including those developed by external vendors our goal must be to keep pace with industry developments with a focus on improving the customers differentiated experience with us by recognizing and responding to customer needs technological innovation has tended to reduce barriers to entry based on cost put another way once someone finds a new better method to accomplish a task in our industry often others are able to replicate or improve on that method sometimes quite rapidly key risks for us therefore are whether we will be able to catch up to breakthroughs quickly enough to avoid customer attrition to adopt and enhance breakthroughs frequently enough and without significant technical failures to attract customers from competitors and if we are able to truly innovate to press our advantage quickly before competitors adopt it to thrive as our industry is disrupted we will need to embrace some of the attitudes of a technology company first horizon national corp form 10k annual report and shed some of the attitudes of a traditional bank this has and will continue to require an evolution in our corporate culture which in turn creates implementation risk in this process it is critical that we not lose sight of how our customers experience working with us and our systems including those customers who still want traditionallydelivered services those who seek and embrace the latest innovations and those who just want services to be convenient personalized and understandable just as disruptive business changes driven by new technologies and new customer preferences can adversely impact us and our entire industry similar events can adversely impact our commercial customers in time a major business disruption can cause dominant businesses to fail and can shrink or even end entire lines of business an example of this is the business failure of the blockbuster video distribution chain and most other video distribution stores and the rise of netflix many other examples of this kind of process are ongoing today in many industries including publishing retail sales news and the creation as well as distribution of audio and video entertainment to the extent disruptions impact our customers we may experience elevated loan losses and loss of ongoing business which we may not be able to recapture with new customers table start operational risks table end fraud is a major and increasing operational risk for us and all banks two traditional areas deposit fraud check kiting wire fraud etc and loan fraud continue to be major sources of fraud attempts and loss the methods used to perpetrate and combat fraud continue to evolve as technology changes our antifraud actions are both preventive anticipating lines of attack educating employees and customers etc and responsive remediating actual attacks our regulators require us and all banks to report fraud promptly regulators often advise banks of new schemes so that the entire industry can adapt as quickly as possible however some level of fraud loss is unavoidable and the risk of a major loss cannot be eliminated our ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon our ability to create maintain expand and evolve an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure manage expenses and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business operational risk can arise in many ways including errors related to failed or inadequate physical operational information technology or other processes faulty or disabled computer or other technology systems fraud theft physical security breaches electronic data and related security breaches or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties and exposure to other external events inadequacies may present themselves in myriad ways actions taken to manage one risk may be ineffective against others for example information technology systems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire incursion malware or other major casualty and they may be insufficiently adaptable to new business conditions or opportunities efforts to make systems more robust may make them less adaptable and viceversa also our efforts to control expenses which is a significant priority for us increases our operational challenges as we strive to maintain customer service and compliance at high quality and low cost a serious information technology security cybersecurity breach can cause significant damage and at the same time be difficult to detect even after it occurs among other things that damage can occur due to outright theft or extortion of our funds fraud or identity theft perpetrated on customers or adverse publicity associated with a breach and its potential effects perpetrators potentially can be employees customers and certain vendors all of whom legitimately have access to some portion of our systems as well as outsiders with no legitimate access because of the potentially very serious consequences associated with these risks our electronic systems and their upgrades need to address internal and external security concerns to a high degree and our systems have to comply with applicable banking and other regulations pertaining to bank safety and customer protection although many of our defenses are systemic and highly technical others are much older and more basic for example periodically we train all our employees to recognize red flags associated with fraud theft and other electronic crimes and we educate our customers as well through regular and episodic securityoriented communications we expect our systems and regulatory requirements to continue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue to evolve the operational functions we outsource to third parties may experience similar disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and in some cases limited ability to obtain an alternate vendor quickly to the extent we rely on third party vendors to perform or assist operational functions the challenge of managing the associated risks may become more difficult the operational functions of business counterparties may experience disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited or no control for example in recent years several major us retailers a major electronic mail provider and a major credit reporting first horizon national corp form 10k annual report firm all experienced data systems incursions reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information online account information and other data of millions of customers retailer incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks including our bank although our systems are not breached in retailer incursions these events can increase account fraud and can cause us to reissue a significant number of account cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to our bank and our customers our ability to recoup our losses may be limited legally or practically in many situations other possible points of incursion or disruption not within our control include internet service providers social media portals distantserver cloud service providers electronic data security providers telecommunications companies and smart phone manufacturers failure to build and maintain or outsource the necessary operational infrastructure failure of that infrastructure to perform its functions or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components suffer damage can lead to risk of loss of service to customers legal actions and noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards additional information concerning operational risks and our management of them all of which is incorporated into this item by this reference appears under the caption operational risk management beginning on page of our mda item the delivery of financial services to customers and others increasingly depends upon technologies systems and multiparty infrastructures which are new creating or enhancing several risks discussed elsewhere examples of the risks created or enhanced by the widespread and rapid adoption of relatively untested technologies include security incursions operational malfunctions or other disruptions and legal claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement competition for talent is substantial and increasing moreover revenue growth in some business lines increasingly depends upon top talent in recent years the cost to us of hiring and retaining top revenueproducing talent has increased and that trend is likely to continue the primary tools we use to attract and retain talent are salaries commission incentive and retention compensation programs retirement benefits change in control severance benefits health and other welfare benefits and our corporate culture to the extent we are unable to use these tools effectively we face the risk that over time our best talent will leave us and we will be unable to replace those persons effectively incentives might operate poorly or have unintended adverse effects incentive programs are difficult to design well and even if welldesigned often they must be updated to address changes in our business a poorly designed incentive programwhere goals are too difficult too easy or not well related to desired outcomescould provide little useful motivation to key employees could increase turnover and could impact customer retention moreover even where those pitfalls are avoided incentive programs may create unintended adverse consequences for example a program focused entirely on revenue production without proper controls may result in costs growing faster than revenues table start risk from economic downturns and changes table end generally in an economic downturn our credit losses increase demand for our products and services declines and the credit quality of our loan portfolio declines delinquencies and credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure on collateral values likewise demand for loans at a given level of creditworthiness deposit and other products and financial services may decline during an economic downturn and may be adversely affected by other national regional or local economic factors that impact demand for loans and other financial products and services such factors include for example changes in employment rates interest rates real estate prices or expectations concerning rates or prices accordingly an economic downturn or other adverse economic change local regional national or global can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses lower loan production levels lower deposit levels compression of our net interest margin and lower fees from transactions and services those effects can continue for many years after the downturn technically ends first horizon national corp form 10k annual report table start risks associated with monetary events table end the federal reserve has implemented significant economic strategies that have impacted interest rates inflation asset values and the shape of the yield curve these strategies have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our business and on many of our customers in response to the recession in and the following uneven recovery the federal reserve implemented a series of domestic monetary initiatives designed to lower rates and make credit easier to obtain the federal reserve changed course in raising rates five times by in each case by a modest basis points it then raised rates four times for a total of basis points in the last two raises were followed by substantial volatility in the us stock market and the last raise was accompanied by a substantial and broad stock market decline in the federal reserve changed course again cutting rates a total of basis points during the first two months of the federal reserve has signaled no clear up or down intentions for rates indicating that future actions will depend upon changes in economic data federal reserve strategies can and often are intended to affect the domestic money supply inflation interest rates and the shape of the yield curve effects on the yield curve often are most pronounced at the short end of the curve which is of particular importance to us and other banks among other things easing strategies are intended to lower interest rates flatten the yield curve expand the money supply and stimulate economic activity while tightening strategies are intended to increase interest rates steepen the yield curve tighten the money supply and restrain economic activity many external factors may interfere with the effects of these plans or cause them to be changed sometimes quickly such factors include significant economic trends or events as well as significant international monetary policies and events such strategies also can affect the us and worldwide financial systems in ways that may be difficult to predict risks associated with interest rates and the yield curve are discussed in this item under the caption interest rate and yield curve risks beginning on page we may be adversely affected by economic and political situations outside the us the us economy and the businesses of many of our customers are linked significantly to economic and market conditions outside the us especially in north america europe and asia and increasingly in central and south america although we have little direct exposure to nonusdollardenominated assets or nonus sovereign debt in the future major adverse events outside the us could have a substantial indirect adverse impact upon us key potential events which could have such an impact include i sovereign debt default default by one or more governments in their borrowings ii bank andor corporate debt default iii market and other liquidity disruptions and if stresses become especially severe iv the collapse of governments alliances or currencies and v military conflicts the methods by which such events could adversely affect us are highly varied but broadly include the following an increase in our cost of borrowed funds or in a worst case the unavailability of borrowed funds through conventional markets impacts upon our hedging and other counterparties impacts upon our customers impacts upon the us economy especially in the areas of employment rates real estate values interest rates and inflationdeflation rates and impacts upon us from our regulatory environment which can change substantially and unpredictably from possible political response to major financial disruptions table start risks related to businesses we may exit table end we may be unable to successfully implement a disposition or winddown of businesses or units which no longer fit our strategic plans we could have closures and divestitures as we continue to adapt to a changing business and regulatory environment key risks associated with exiting a business include table start our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms table endtable start our ability to identify and implement key customer technology systems and other transition actions to table end avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses table start our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses and table endtable start our ability to manage capital liquidity and other challenges that may arise if an exit results in significant legacy cash expenditures or financial loss table end first horizon national corp form 10k annual report table start legacy mortgage business risks table end we have risks from the mortgagerelated businesses we exited including mortgage loan repurchase and lossreimbursement risk claims of improper foreclosure practices claims of noncompliance with contractual and regulatory requirements and the risk of higher default rates on loans made by our former businesses in we exited our national mortgage and related lending businesses however in our nonstrategic segment we still retain as assets a significant amount of loans that those businesses created most of those loans are secured by residential or other real estate situated across the us we retain the risk of liability to customers and contractual parties with whom we dealt in the course of operating those businesses these legacy assets and obligations continue to impose risks on us key risks include table start we are contending with and defending litigation matters associated with indemnity claims arising out of our former pre2009 mortgage origination and sale activities the outcome of those matters is uncertain losses in excess of current accruals reserves could be material although some types of new claims and actions no longer are legally viable due to the passage of time others could still arise table endtable start we could be subject to claims that servicingrelated actions were done improperly or improperly were not done although we may be able to demand indemnity in cases where servicing was performed on our behalf by another institution there is risk that such an indemnity demand could be refused by the institution or rejected by an appropriate court table end additional information concerning risks related to our former mortgage businesses and our management of them all of which is incorporated into this item by this reference is set forth under the captions repurchase obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations beginning on page obligations from pre2009 mortgage businesses beginning on page repurchase accrual methodology beginning on page foreclosure practices beginning on page and contingent liabilities beginning on page of our mda item and under the captions material matters and exposures from pre2009 mortgage business both beginning on page within note 17contingencies and other disclosures of our financial statements item we have exposures related to the mortgage servicing obligations and assets which we retained after we generally sold our mortgage businesses in especially in relation to the subservicing arrangements we made between and the sale of substantially all our remaining servicing assets completed in when we sold our origination and servicing businesses in we retained significant servicing obligations and assets since then we engaged subservicers to provide loan servicing to borrowers and trustees on our behalf when we have been unable to divest those obligations complaints against the servicing provided often are directed first to us as the servicer of record additional information concerning risks related to former servicing and foreclosure practices and our management of them all of which is incorporated into this item by this reference is set forth under the captions repurchase accrual methodology beginning on page foreclosure practices beginning on page and contingent liabilities beginning on page of our mda item and under the caption exposures from pre2009 mortgage business beginning on page within note 17contingencies and other disclosures of our financial statements item several large purchasers of mortgagebacked securities have filed suits against the trustees for those securitizations asserting various theories of liability the trustee of our securitizations is defending such matters and many of our securitizations are among those alleged to have been purchased by the plaintiffs the claims for damages are based in part on allegations that the trustee did not properly or timely act against the originators of the securitizations or the servicers of the loans and further assert that the trustee has affirmative duties to act which were not set forth in the legal trust documents some of the legal theories advanced are untested or unsettled although we are not a defendant in these proceedings these complex suits may progress or evolve so as to compel us to defend ourselves or our trustee and could create financial exposure for us table start reputation risks table end our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and to obtain and retain customers is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and financial stability our reputation is therefore a key asset for us our reputation is affected principally by our business practices and how those practices are perceived and understood by others adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors or our industry as a whole first horizon national corp form 10k annual report also may adversely impact our reputation in addition negative perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring assessment and management damage to our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity could hamper our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones could impact the market value of our stock could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties and could undermine our ability to attract and retain talented employees among other things adverse impacts on our reputation or the reputation of our industry also may result in greater regulatory andor legislative scrutiny which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrain our business or operations events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk political and social fragmentation in the us combined with access to social media platforms can increase reputation risk in ways that might not be easily avoided by traditional means the predominant culture within the banking industry remains traditional in order to preserve their business reputations banks generally prefer to avoid direct public involvement in political or social controversy increasingly though certain groupshaving highly specific political or social agendas and with the ability to communicate their views effectively using social media platformshave made it more difficult to maintain a traditional approach one group for example may publicly criticize a bank for having as a customer a business which exploits persons of limited financial means while another group may criticize a bank for failing to have as a customer the same business which serves such persons in neighborhoods that many businesses avoid as another example a group may demand that a bank cease doing business with a specific business customer based on the customers industry or a specific business practice because that industry or practice though legal is objectionable to that group while the potential for such demands has always existed special interest groups today are more able and willing to publicize their criticisms and some are willing to use factual exaggerations and inflammatory language in stating their views to the public those criticisms in turn ultimately may be acted upon by legislators or regulators table start credit risks table end we face the risk that our customers may not repay their loans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a chargeoff we also face risks that other counterparties in a wide range of situations may fail to honor their obligations to pay us in our business some level of credit chargeoffs is unavoidable and overall levels of credit chargeoffs can vary substantially over time in the most recent credit cycle net chargeoffs were million in and increased to million and million in and respectively beginning in net chargeoffs began to decline million in million in and million in in recent years our loan loss reserves also have declined from high levels the allowance for loan loss was million as of december down substantially from million and million at yearend and respectively we have experienced very low levels of chargeoffs in recent years and have experienced some loanloss recoveries from loans that were charged off during the last down cycle net chargeoffs should increase at some point when the credit cycle moves into its next phase our ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of loan customers and other counterparties and the value of any collateral including real estate among other things we further manage credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio by managing its granularity by following perrelationship lending limits and by recording and managing an allowance for loan losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules we further manage other counterparty credit risk in a variety of ways some of which are discussed in other parts of this item and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance of having too much risk concentrated with any single counterparty we record loan chargeoffs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules as indicated in this item under the caption accounting tax risks beginning on page these guidelines and rules could change and cause provision expense or chargeoffs to be more volatile or to be recognized on an accelerated basis for reasons not always related to the underlying performance of our portfolio in fact as mentioned there starting january such an accounting change is applicable to us moreover the sec or pcaob could take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the federal reserve occ or other banking regulators a significant challenge for us is to keep the credit and other models and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment in real estate prices and other collateral values in the economy and in the regulatory environment among other things based on our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios changes in modeling could have significant impacts upon our reported first horizon national corp form 10k annual report financial results and condition in addition we use those models and approaches to manage our loan portfolios and lending businesses to the extent our models and approaches are not consistent with underlying realworld conditions our management decisions could be misguided or otherwise affected with substantial adverse consequences to us the recent lowinterest rate environment has elevated the traditional challenge for lenders and investors to balance taking on higher risk against the desire for higher income or yield this challenge applies not only to credit risk in lending activities but also to default and rate risks regarding investments if interest rates rise default risk also rises as borrowers obligations to pay interest increase financial weaknesses become more evident initially this results in lower consumer credit scores and lower commercial loan grading and later results in higher default rates credit losses tend to increase and decrease in a cyclical manner although the duration and timing of any given credit cycle is impossible to predict accurately it is clear that we and other us banks recently have experienced an extended period of very low credit losses and that period followed several years of extremely high losses it is inevitable that credit losses will rise well beyond current levels when the next cycle begins it is extremely difficult for banks and for investors to know when an uptick in credit loss is merely idiosyncratic or instead portends a major credit cycle change the composition of our loan portfolio inherently increases our sensitivity to certain credit risks at december approximately of total loans consisted of the commercial financial and industrial ci category while approximately consisted of the consumer real estate category the largest component of the ci category at year end was loans to mortgage companies a component which represented about of the ci category at that time the second largest component was loans to finance and insurance companies as a result approximately of the ci category was sensitive to impacts on the financial services industry as discussed elsewhere in this item with respect to our company the financial services industry is more sensitive to interest rate and yield curve changes monetary policy regulatory policy changes in real estate and other asset values and changes in general economic conditions than many other industries negative impacts on the industry could dampen new lending in these lines of business and could create credit impacts for the loans in our portfolio the consumer real estate category contains a number of concentrations which affect credit risk assessment of the category table start product concentration the consumer real estate category consists primarily of consumer installment loans and much of the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit table endtable start collateral concentration this entire category is secured by residential real estate approximately of the category consists of loans secured on a secondlien basis table endtable start geographic concentration at year end about of the category related to tennessee customers related to north carolina related to florida related to california and no other state represented more than of the category table endtable start legacy concentration we still have approximately billion of loans originated before by our legacy national mortgage lending business those include loans we originated and did not sell along with loans we have repurchased in the course of resolving claims with loan buyers our legacy loan portfolio continues to shrink but the rate of shrinkage is slowing table end the consumer real estate category is highly sensitive to economic impacts on consumer customers and on residential real estate values job loss or downward job migration as well as significant life events such as divorce death or disability can significantly impact credit evaluations of the portfolio also regulatory changes discussed above and elsewhere in this item are more likely to affect the consumer category and our accounting estimates of credit loss than other loan types volatility in the oil gas industry can impact us our houston office specializes in commercial lending that office significantly focuses on three areas energy commercial real estate cre and commercial financial industrial ci much of our houston business is connected at least in part to the energy industry especially oil and gas production and distribution in addition to general credit and other risks mentioned elsewhere in this item the energy business and related assets are sensitive to a number of factors specific to that industry key among those is global demand for energy and other products from oil and gas in relation to supply the shifting balance between demand and supply is expressed most simply in prices significant oilprice volatility can and often does impact our overall business in this industry by increasing chargeoffs and reducing demand for loans

respectively of our mda item table start regulatory legislative and legal risks table end the regulatory environment continues to be challenging we operate in a heavily regulated industry our regulatory burdens including both operating restrictions and ongoing compliance costs are substantial we are subject to many banking deposit insurance securities brokerage and underwriting and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly traded in the us securities markets and in particular on the new york stock exchange failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in financial structural and operational penalties in addition efforts to comply with applicable regulations may increase our costs andor limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities see supervision and regulation in item of this report beginning on page for additional information concerning financial industry regulations federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we as a financial institution may engage in addition we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business such as in the areas of employment and intellectual property federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities increasingly consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones such actions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge could further restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral could affect the terms or profitability of the products and services we offer or could materially affect us in other ways the following paragraphs highlight certain specific important risk areas related to regulatory matters currently these paragraphs do not describe these risks exhaustively and they do not describe all such risks that we face currently moreover the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish as circumstances change we and our bank both are required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios us capital standards are discussed in item of this report in tabular and narrative form under the caption capital adequacy starting on page pressures to maintain appropriate capital levels and address business needs in a changing economy may lead to actions that could be dilutive or otherwise adverse to our shareholders such actions could include reduction or elimination of dividends the issuance of common or preferred stock or securities convertible into stock or the issuance of any class of stock having rights that are adverse to those of the holders of our existing classes of common or preferred stock additional information concerning these risks and our management of them all of which is incorporated into this item by this reference appears under the captions capital adequacy and prompt corrective action pca in item of this report beginning on pages and respectively under the captions capital2019 compared to capital risk management and adequacy and market uncertainties and prospective trends beginning on pages and respectively of our mda item and under the caption regulatory capital in note 12regulatory capital and restrictions beginning on page of our financial statements item legal disputes are an unavoidable part of business and the outcome of pending or threatened litigation cannot be predicted with any certainty we face the risk of litigation from customers employees vendors contractual parties and other persons either singly or in class actions and from federal or state regulators we manage those risks through internal controls personnel training insurance litigation management our compliance and ethics processes and other means however the commencement outcome and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with any certainty typically we are unable to estimate our loss exposure from legal claims until relatively late in the litigation process which can make our financial recognition of loss from litigation unpredictable and highly uneven from one period to the next for most of our pending legal matters we have established either no accrual reserve or no significant reserve financial accounting guidance requires that litigation loss be both estimable and first horizon national corp form 10k annual report probable before a reserve may be established recorded as a liability on our balance sheet under that guidance reserves typically are not established for most litigation matters until after preliminary motions to dismiss or to narrow the case are resolved after discovery is substantially in process and in many cases after preliminary overtures regarding settlement have occurred potentially significant cases often are pending for years before any loss is recognized and a reserve is established moreover many cases experience relatively little progress toward resolution for a long period followed by a brief period of rapid development lastly although most cases are resolved with little or no loss to us for the others our loss typically is recognized either all at once near the time of resolution or very unevenly over the life of the case additional information concerning litigation risks and our management of them all of which is incorporated into this item by this reference appears under the caption legacy mortgage business risks beginning on page of this report under the captions repurchase obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations repurchase accrual methodology market uncertainties and prospective trends and contingent liabilities beginning on pages and respectively of our mda item and under the caption contingencies in note 17contingencies and other disclosures beginning on page of our financial statements item political dysfunction and volatility within the federal government both at the regulatory and congressional level creates significant potential for major and abrupt shifts in federal policy regarding bank regulation taxes and the economy any of which could have significant impacts on our business and financial performance moreover political conflict within and among branches of government and within and among government agencies can rise to a level where daytoday functions could be interrupted or impaired data privacy is becoming a major political concern the laws governing it are new and are likely to evolve and expand many nonregulated nonbanking companies have gathered large amounts of personal details about millions of people and have the ability to analyze that data and act on that analysis very quickly this situation has prompted governmental responses two prominent responses are the european union general data protection regulation and the california data privacy protection act neither is a banking industry regulation but both apply to banks in relation to certain customers further general regulation to protect data privacy appears likely and banking industry regulations might be enlarged as well public expectations concerning corporate controls on emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases could increase our operating costs in the future without a corresponding increase in revenue could curtail some aspects of our business or both at present environmental regulations do not require us to monitor the direct or indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with building operating or maintaining our physical facilities nor are we taxed or fined in relation to those emissions because such gases generally are not considered to be pollutants under federal law changing expectations could pressure us to physically measure monitor and curtail direct emissions and to estimate indirect emissions or impacts and eventually could result in legal requirements to take those actions or to pay for measured or estimated emissions whether or not legally required any such actions that we take would increase our operating costs in addition such expectations could pressure us to discontinue business relationships with certain customers or groups of customers that have suboptimal reputations for emissions table start risks of expense control table end our ability to successfully manage expenses is important to our longterm survival and prosperity but in part is subject to risks beyond our control many factors can influence the amount of our expenses as well as how quickly they grow as our businesses changewhether by acquisition expansion or contractionadditional expenses can arise from asset purchases structural reorganization evolving business strategies and changing regulations among other things we manage controllable expenses and risk through a variety of means including selectively outsourcing or multisourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes in recent years we have actively sought to make strategic businesses more efficient primarily by investing in technology rethinking and rightsizing our physical facilities and rethinking and rightsizing our workforce and incentive programs these efforts usually entail additional nearterm expenses in the form of technology purchases and implementation facility closure or renovation costs and severance costs while expected benefits typically are realized with some uncertainty in the future we have also focused our attention on the economic profit generated by our business activities and prospects rather than emphasizing revenues or ordinary profit economic profit analysis attempts to relate ordinary profit to the capital employed to create that profit with the goal of achieving higher more efficient returns on capital first horizon national corp form 10k annual report employed overall activities with higher capital usage bear a greater burden in economic profit analysis the process is intended to allow us to more efficiently manage investment and utilization of resources economic profit analysis involves significant judgment regarding capital allocation mistakes in those judgments could result in a misallocation of resources and diminished profitability over the long run despite our efforts our costs could rise due to adverse structural changes or market shifts for example the overall cost of our health insurance benefit is highly dependent upon regulatory factors and market forces beyond our control table start geographic risks table end we are subject to risks of operating in various jurisdictions to a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic regulatory natural disaster and other risks that primarily impact tennessee and neighboring states where we do our traditional banking business if the southeastern us were to experience adversity not shared by other parts of the country we are likely to experience adversity to a degree not shared by those competitors which have a broader or different regional footprint examples of these kinds of risks include earthquakes in memphis hurricanes in florida the carolina coasts or the texas coast a major change in health insurance laws impacting the many healthcare companies in middle tennessee and automotive industry plant closures we have international assets in the form of loans and letters of credit holding nonus assets creates a number of risks the risk that taxes fees prohibitions and other barriers and constraints may be created or increased by the us or other countries that would impact our holdings the risk that currency exchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish the us dollar value of assets or to enlarge the us dollar value of liabilities and the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in unexpected ways our ability to manage those and other risks depends upon a number of factors including our ability to recognize and anticipate differences in legal cultural and other expectations applicable to customers regulators vendors and other business partners and counterparties and our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed table start insurance table end our property and casualty insurance may not cover or may be inadequate to cover the risks that we face and we are or may be adversely affected by a default by insurers we use insurance to manage a number of risks including damage or destruction of property as well as legal and other liability not all such risks are insured in any given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss and many risks we face are uninsurable for those risks that are insured we also face the risks that the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them we treat the risk of default as a type of credit risk which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when practical the risk of refusal whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith is inherent in any contractual situation a portion of our consumer loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance if a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent that could adversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provision or writedown of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and in either case a corresponding impact on our financial results if many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time the risk of a financial impact would be amplified we own certain bankowned life insurance policies as assets on our books some of those policies are general account and others are separate account the general account policies are subject to the risk that the carrier might experience a significant downgrade or become insolvent the separate account policies are less susceptible to carrier risk but do carry a higher risk of value fluctuations in securities which underlie those policies both risks are managed through periodic reviews of the carriers and the underlying security values however particularly for the general account policies our ability to liquidate a policy in anticipation of an adverse carrier event is significantly limited by applicable insurance contracts and regulations as well as by a substantial tax penalty which could be levied upon early policy termination when we selfinsure certain exposures our estimates of future expenditures may be inadequate for the actual expenditures that occur for example we selfinsure our employee healthinsurance benefit program we estimate future expenditures and establish accruals reserves based first horizon national corp form 10k annual report on the estimates if actual expenditures were to exceed our estimates in a future period our future expenses could be adversely and unexpectedly increased table start liquidity and funding risks table end liquidity is essential to our business model and a lack of liquidity or an increase in the cost of liquidity may materially and adversely affect our businesses results of operations financial conditions and cash flows in general the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and therefore can positively or negatively affect our financial results our funding requirements in were met principally by deposits by financing from other financial institutions and by funds obtained from the capital markets deposits traditionally have provided our most affordable funds and by far the largest portion of funding however deposit trends can shift with economic conditions if interest rates rise deposit levels in our bank might fall perhaps fairly quickly if a tipping point is reached as depositors become more comfortable with risk and seek higher returns in other vehicles this could pressure us to raise our deposit rates which could shrink our net interest margin if loan rates do not rise correspondingly the market among banks for deposits may be impacted by current capital rules those rules generally provide favorable treatment for core deposits institutions with less than billion of assets are not required to maintain a minimum liquidity coverage ratio at or above billion the requirement increases with size and certain activities the largest banks which must maintain the highest minimum ratio may be incented to compete for core deposits vigorously although midsized banks like ours are only lightly impacted by this rule if some large banks in our markets take aggressive actions we could lose deposit share or be compelled to adjust our deposit pricing and practices in ways that could increase our costs we also depend upon financing from private institutional or other investors by means of the capital markets in we issued million of senior holdingcompany notes due the notes refinanced an earlier fiveyear notes issue presently we believe we could access the capital markets again if we desired to do so risk remains however that capital markets may become unavailable to us for reasons beyond our control a number of more general factors could make funding more difficult more expensive or unavailable on affordable terms including but not limited to our financial results organizational or political changes adverse impacts on our reputation changes in the activities of our business partners disruptions in the capital markets specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry counterparty availability changes affecting our loan portfolio or other assets changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure interest rate fluctuations ratings agency actions general economic conditions and the legal regulatory accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions in addition our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the us and world economies and financial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the us government and its agencies and may remain or become increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors beyond our control events affecting interest rates markets and other factors may adversely affect the demand for our products and services in our fixed income business as a result disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit table start credit ratings table end our credit ratings directly affect the availability and cost of our unsecured funding fhn and the bank currently receive ratings from several rating agencies for unsecured borrowings a rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of marketbased funding a debt rating of baa3 or higher by moodys investors service or bbb or higher by fitch ratings is considered investment grade for many purposes at december both rating agencies rated the unsecured senior debt of fhn and of the bank as investment grade the ratings outlook was stable from moodys and from fitch for both fhn and the bank to the extent that in the future we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of unsecured funding if our debt ratings were lowered further particularly if lowered below investment grade in addition other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affect the cost and availability of funding including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist please note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to first horizon national corp form 10k annual report buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating reductions in our credit ratings could result in counterparties reducing or terminating their relationships with us some parties with whom we do business may have internal policies restricting the business that can be done with financial institutions such as the bank that have credit ratings lower than a certain threshold reductions in our credit ratings could allow some counterparties to terminate and immediately force us to settle certain derivatives agreements and could force us to provide additional collateral with respect to certain derivatives agreements under our margin agreements we are required to post collateral in the amount of our derivative liability positions with most derivative counterparties at this time those of our isda master agreements which have ratings triggers reference the lower of standard poors financial services llc or moodys ratings if a credit rating downgrade had occurred as of december the maximum specified additional collateral we would have been required to post would have been approximately million table start interest rate and yield curve risks table end we are subject to interest rate risk because a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money and investing in financial instruments a significant portion of our funding comes from shortterm and demand deposits while a significant portion of our lending and investing is in mediumterm and longterm instruments changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses and could expand or compress our net interest margin we actively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates in addition our fixed income segment tends to perform better when rates decline or markets are volatile which tends to partially offset net interest margin compression a flat or inverted yield curve may reduce our net interest margin and adversely affect our lending and fixed income businesses the yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicable to short and long term debt the curve is steep when shortterm rates are much lower than longterm rates it is flat when shortterm rates are nearly equal to longterm rates and it is inverted when shortterm rates exceed longterm rates historically the yield curve usually is upwardly sloped higher rates for longer terms however the yield curve can be relatively flat or inverted sloped downward which happened several times in and a flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin which would adversely impact our lending businesses and it tends to reduce demand for longterm debt securities which would adversely impact the revenues of our fixed income business we appear to be in a waiting period in terms of interest rate policy the uncertainties of the direction magnitude and timing of future rate actions could adversely affect us the federal reserve raised shortterm rates by four times in and reduced rates by three times in the actions flattened the yield curve the actions steepened the curve only very modestly the federal reserve has signaled no direction for rate changes in or if rates in fact remain stable and market participants come to expect longterm stability the yield curve may steepen to a more normal shape which should benefit us however in the meantime in many respects the impact on us of uncertain interest rate policy is likely to be uneven with benefits and detriments that are difficult to predict see risks associated with monetary events beginning on page of this report for additional information marketindexed deposit products are very sensitive to changes in shortterm rates and our use of them increases our exposure to such changes expectations by the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements can impact the demand for fixed income investments which in turn can impact the revenues of our fixed income business that risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain the likely discontinuance of libor as a viable benchmark rate after may adversely affect our business and our operating results in the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after as a result libor as currently operated may not continue after it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the administrator of libor or whether any additional reforms to libor may be enacted in the united kingdom or elsewhere there are serious doubts that libor will continue after in a form that will be practical at this time it is not clear which rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor the leading alternative rate in the us the secured overnight financing rate sofr published by the federal reserve bank of new york is not directly comparable to libor and cannot easily or simply be substituted for it in outstanding instruments key differences between the two are sofr is first horizon national corp form 10k annual report based on secured lending libor is not and sofr historically has been published only as an overnight rate while libor is published in several shortterm maturity periods starting in march a compounded average sofr will be published for periods of and days which is intended to address the latter difference it is impossible to predict the effect of sofr or any other alternatives on the value of liborbased securities and variable rate loans our primary exposures to libor are in variablerate loans and in hedging transactions we are not able to determine the impact on us that libor discontinuance will have the simplicity and long history of using libor the lack of a definite alternative and the possibility that different alternatives ultimately may be used in different circumstances means that libor continues to be used in many new instruments in addition it is not known how a transition away from libor or to a new version of libor will impact our ability to use hedge accounting after however accounting and tax agencies have issued preliminary guidance that should ease that transition a few instruments issued by us including the banks class a noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and certain trust preferred obligations have floating rate terms based on libor as mentioned above it is not known whether libor will continue after in a workable form we have risk that an adverse outcome of the libor transition after could increase our interest dividend and other costs relative to those instruments we may not be able to refinance those instruments on terms that reduce those costs to the level we would have expected if libor were to continue indefinitely unchanged additionally a transition from libor could adversely impact or change our hedge accounting practices table start asset inventories and market risks table end the trading securities inventories and loans held for sale in our fixed income business are subject to market and credit risks in the course of that business we hold trading securities inventory and loan positions for purposes of distribution to customers and we are exposed to certain market risks attributable principally to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with those assets we manage the risks of holding inventories of securities and loans through certain market risk management policies and procedures including for example hedging activities and valueatrisk var limits trading policies modeling and stress analyses average fixed income trading securities long positions were billion for billion for and billion for average fixed income trading liabilities short positions were billion billion and billion for and respectively average loans held for sale in our fixed income business were billion billion and billion for and additional information concerning these risks and our management of them all of which is incorporated into this item by this reference appears under the caption market risk management beginning on page of our mda item declines disruptions or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect our fees and other income sources we earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business and our management of assets for customers declines disruptions or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources significant changes to the securities markets performance can have a material impact upon our assets liabilities and financial results we have a number of assets and obligations that are linked directly or indirectly to major securities markets significant changes in market performance can have a material impact upon our assets liabilities and financial results an example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pension plan so that it may satisfy benefit claims in the future our pension funding obligations generally depend upon actuarial estimates of benefits claims the discount rate used to estimate the present values of those claims and estimates of plan asset values our obligations to fund the plan can be affected by changes in any of those three factors accordingly our obligations diminish if the plans investments perform better than expectations or if estimates are changed anticipating better performance and can grow if those investments perform poorly or if expectations worsen a rise in interest rates is likely to negatively impact the values of fixed income assets held in the plan but would also result in an increase in the discount rate used to measure the present value of future benefit payments similarly our obligations can be impacted by changes in mortality tables or other actuarial inputs we manage the risk of rate changes by investing first horizon national corp form 10k annual report plan assets in fixed income securities having maturities aligned with the expected timing of payouts because there are no new participants the actuarialinput risk should slowly diminish over time changes in our funding obligation generally translate into positive or negative changes in our pension expense over time which in turn affects our financial performance our obligations and expenses relative to the plan can be affected by many other things including changes in our participating employee population and changes to the plan itself although we have taken actions intended to moderate future volatility in this area risk of some level of volatility is unavoidable our hedging activities may be ineffective may not adequately hedge our risks and are subject to credit risk in the normal course of our businesses we attempt to create partial or full economic hedges of various though not all financial risks for example our fixed income unit manages interest rate risk on a portion of its trading portfolio with short positions futures and options contracts and we use derivatives including swaps swaptions caps forward contracts options and collars that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rates change generally in the latter example these hedged items include certain term borrowings and certain heldtomaturity loans hedging creates certain risks for us including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform counterparty risk which is a type of credit risk and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended hedge failure risk unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings table start accounting tax risks table end the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements the estimate that is consistently one of our most critical is the level of the allowance for credit losses however other estimates can be highly significant at discrete times or during periods of varying length for example the valuation or impairment of our deferred tax assets estimates are made at specific points in time as actual events unfold estimates are adjusted accordingly due to the inherent nature of these estimates it is possible that at some time in the future we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses andor sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of assets or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today moreover in some cases especially concerning litigation and other contingency matters where critical information is inadequate often we are unable to make estimates until fairly late in a lengthy process we lack firsthand visibility regarding certain loans other assets or liabilities which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate for example interagency supervisory guidance related to practices for loans and lines of credit secured by junior liens on family residential properties requires that the performance of the first lien should be considered when assessing the collectability and inherent loss of a performing junior lien we own and service a consumer real estate portfolio that is primarily composed of home equity lines and installment loans as of december that amount was billion as of december approximately billion or of the consumer real estate portfolio consisted of standalone second liens while billion or were second liens whose first liens are owned or serviced by fhn we are not able to actively monitor the performance status of the first liens that are serviced by others we obtain first lien performance information from third parties and through loss mitigation activities and we place a standalone second lien loan on nonaccrual if we discover that there are performance issues with the first lien loan it is possible that if our evaluation methods change or information sources otherwise improve our additions to nonperforming loans may be material changes in accounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets liabilities revenues expenses and earnings although such changes generally affect all companies in a given industry in practice changes sometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or business operations of companies within the same industry one such accounting change asu measurement of credit losses on financial instruments substantially revises the measurement and recognition of credit losses for certain assets including most loans in a manner that will substantially and adversely change when and how we recognize loan loss asu is effective for us on january under asu when we make or acquire a new loan that is covered by the standard we will be required to recognize immediately the current expected credit loss or cecl of that loan we will also reevaluate cecl each quarter that the loan is outstanding cecl is the difference between our cost and the net amount we expect to collect over the life of the loan using certain estimation methods and our experience with other similar loans in contrast the current accounting standard first horizon national corp form 10k annual report delays recognition of credit loss until loss is probable very likely we adopted asu and cecl accounting starting in with the impact on regulatory capital having a short phasein period starting in recognition of estimated credit loss will be significantly accelerated compared to prececl practice additional information concerning asu and its effects upon us appears in note 1summary of significant accounting policies within our financial statements item under the heading accounting changes issued but not currently effective beginning on page which information is incorporated into this item by reference in comparison with former pre2020 standards cecl accounting likely will result in a significant increase in our loan loss provision expense and allowance reserve during any period of loan growth including organic growth and growth created by acquisition or merger through the increased provision adversely impact our earnings and correspondingly our regulatory capital levels and enhance volatility in loan loss provision and allowance levels from quarter to quarter and year to year especially during times when the economy is in transition moreover cecl creates an incentive for banks to reduce new lending in the down part of the economic cycle in order to reduce loss recognition and conserve regulatory capital that perverse incentive could nationwide prolong a down cycle in the economy and delay a recovery changes in regulatory rules can create significant accounting impacts for us because we operate in a regulated industry we prepare regulatory financial reports based on regulatory accounting standards changes in those standards can have significant impacts upon us in terms of regulatory compliance in addition such changes can impact our ordinary financial reporting and uncertainties related to regulatory changes can create uncertainties in our financial reporting our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures controls and procedures must be effective in order to provide assurance that financial reports are materially accurate a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations table start stockholding and governance risks table end the principal source of cash flow to pay dividends on our stock as well as service our debt is dividends and distributions from the bank and the bank may become unable to pay dividends to us without regulatory approval we primarily depend upon common dividends from the bank for cash to fund dividends we pay to our common and preferred stockholders and to service our outstanding debt regulatory constraints might prevent the bank from declaring and paying dividends to us in without regulatory approval applying the applicable regulatory rules at january the bank could legally declare cash dividends on the banks common or preferred stock of approximately million without obtaining regulatory approval also we are required to provide financial support to the bank accordingly at any given time a portion of our funds may have to be used for that purpose and therefore would be unavailable for dividends furthermore the federal reserve has issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings the federal reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies among other things that as a general matter a bank holding company should inform the federal reserve and should eliminate defer or significantly reduce its dividends if i the bank holding companys net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters net of dividends previously paid during that period is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends ii the bank holding companys prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding companys capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition or iii the bank holding company will not meet or is in danger of not meeting its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios our stockholders may suffer dilution if we raise capital through public or private equity financings to fund our operations to increase our capital or to expand if we raise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders will be reduced the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of our common or outstanding preferred stock and additional issuances could be at a sales price which is dilutive to current stockholders we may also issue equity securities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that would be dilutive to stockholders in terms of voting power and shareofownership and could be dilutive financially or economically the ibkc merger for example will result in a significant increase in our outstanding shares we estimate that immediately after the ibkc merger fhn will issue to former ibkc shareholders fhn common first horizon national corp form 10k annual report  representing about of our postclosing outstanding shares legacy fhn shareholders will own only about of the postclosing outstanding shares we hope to mitigate the financial and economic pershare dilutive effects of that issuance by integrating ibkcs businesses and operations with our current businesses and operations effectively and at an acceptable level of cost and as a result achieving net expense reductions and net revenue increases in comparison with the two companies on a standalone basis a key risk is that we will fail to achieve one or more of those results our issuance of preferred stock raises regulatory capital without issuing common shares but creates or expands our general obligation to pay all preferred dividends ahead of any common dividends currently we have two series of preferred stock outstanding one issued by the bank and one by fhn after the ibkc merger closes fhn will have outstanding three additional series of preferred stock subject to capital needs and market conditions additional series may be issued in the future provisions of tennessee law and certain provisions of our charter and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of our stockholders in addition federal banking laws prohibit nonfinancialindustry companies from owning a bank and require regulatory approval of any change in control of a bank certain legal rights of holders of our stock to pursue claims against us are limited by our bylaws our bylaws have an exclusive forum clause which provides unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum that a state or federal court located within shelby county in the state of tennessee will be the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought in the right of fhn ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director officer or other employee of fhn to fhn or its shareholders iii any action asserting a claim against fhn or any director officer or other employee of fhn arising pursuant to any provision of the tennessee business corporation act of fhns charter or of its bylaws or iv any action asserting a claim against fhn or any director officer or other employee of fhn that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine the bylaws exclusive forum clause may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against fhn or its directors officers or other employees or against the depositary as applicable the clause also may lead to increased costs to bring a claim or may limit the ability of holders of fhns stock to bring a claim in a judicial forum they find favorable in addition to the fullest extent permitted by law the exclusive forum clause will apply to any actions or proceedings described in the four categories specified above that arise or purport to arise under the federal securities laws including those under the securities act of as amended andor the securities exchange act of as amended to the extent the exclusive forum clause restricts the courts in which holders of our stock may bring claims arising under the federal securities laws there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce the clause the exclusive forum clause does not mean that holders of fhns stock have waived fhns obligations to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder
