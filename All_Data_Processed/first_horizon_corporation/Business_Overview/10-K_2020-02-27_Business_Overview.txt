framework applicable to bank and financial holding companies and their subsidiaries and to companies engaged in securities and insurance activities it also provides certain specific information about us to the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions it is qualified in its entirety by express reference to each of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions a change in applicable statutes regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business overview fhn first horizon national corp form 10k annual report fhn is a bank holding company and financial holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of as amended the bhca and is registered with the federal reserve we are subject to the regulation and supervision of and to examination by the federal reserve under the bhca we are required to file with the federal reserve annual reports and such additional information as the federal reserve may require pursuant to the bhca a bank holding company that is not a financial holding company is limited to engaging in banking and activities found by the federal reserve to be closely related to banking eligible bank holding companies that elect to become financial holding companies may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature financial activities are broader in scope than those which are closely related to banking see financial activities other than banking beginning on page below the federal reserve may approve an application by a bank holding company to acquire a bank located outside the acquirers principal state of operations without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law although state law may still impose certain requirements see interstate banking and branching beginning on page and community reinvestment act cra beginning on page the tennessee bank structure act of among other things prohibits subject to certain exceptions a bank holding company from acquiring a bank for which the home state is tennessee a tennessee bank if upon consummation the company would directly or indirectly control or more of the total deposits in insured depository institutions in tennessee as of june we estimate that we held approximately of such deposits the bank our bank is a tennessee banking corporation subject to the regulation and supervision of and to examination by the tdfi in addition to general supervision and examination powers the tdfi has the power to approve mergers with the bank the banks issuance of preferred stock or capital notes the establishment of banking centers and many other corporate actions the bank has chosen to be a member of the federal reserve as a result the federal reserve is the banks primary federal regulator as a member bank the bank must buy and hold stock in its district federal reserve bank equal to of the banks capital stock and surplus the bank is paid a dividend on its investment at a rate which varies with tenyear us treasury rates capped at the bank cannot sell its investment in federal reserve bank stock and the investment provides the bank with no control over the federal reserve system tennessee law requires the bank as a member of the federal reserve to comply with federal capital and many other regulatory requirements in lieu of or sometimes in addition to state requirements for that reason this supervision and regulation section focuses on federal requirements for many topics related to the bank mentioning state requirements only where significant from until october the bank was a national banking association subject to the regulation and supervision of and to examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency during october the bank converted from a national bank to a tennessee state bank conversion did not significantly alter the scope of the banks activities tennessee law generally allows a tennessee state bank to take any action that a tennesseebased national bank could take the bank is insured by and subject to regulation by the fdic and is subject to regulation in certain respects by the cfpb the bank is also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged limitations on the types of investments that may be made activities that may be engaged in and types of services that may be offered various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the bank in addition several of the banks subsidiaries are regulated separately as discussed in subsidiaries beginning on page of this report in addition to the impact of regulation commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the federal reserve as it attempts to control money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy also the bank and certain of its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tiein arrangements in connection with extensions of credit leases or sales of property or furnishing products or services the regulatory framework governing banks and the financial industry is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the federal deposit insurance fund not for the protection of our bank or our security holders regulatory tiers based on asset size many rules dealing with critical regulatory topics divide banks into tiers based largely or entirely on asset size different topics have different cutoff points for the tiers within each topic different rules apply to the different tiers cutoff points vary significantly however as a rough generalization for many regulatory topics the critical cutoff points are billion billion and billion companies with less than billion are less regulated in several important ways than we are and companies with billion or more are regulated much more severely in many important ways than we are as a result under first horizon national corp form 10k annual report current law compliance costs and restrictions grow with size they tend to change abruptly as a company crosses to the next tier and we are in a middle tier in many respects the remainder of this supervision and regulation discussion focuses on current rules which apply to fhn based on our current asset size largebank supervision risk categories federal regulators have established four riskbased categories for applying enhanced prudential standards enhanced for larger banks category i applies to the global systemically important companies categories ii iii and iv apply with certain exceptions to institutions with total consolidated assets of at least billion billion and billion respectively currently we and the bank are below category ivs floor and therefore generally we are not subject to enhanced prudential standards we expect that immediately after closing the ibkc merger and 30branch acquisition mentioned in this item above we will continue to be below category ivs floor payment of dividends fhn is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and other subsidiaries fhns principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends on its stock or to pay principal including premium if any and interest on debt securities is dividends from the bank there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the bank to fhn as well as by fhn to its shareholders fhn under tennessee corporate law fhn is not permitted to pay cash dividends if after giving effect to such payment fhn would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving in addition in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size our board must consider our current and prospective capital liquidity and other needs including the needs of the bank which fhn is obligated to support the bank under tennessee corporate law the bank like fhn discussed above may not pay a dividend if the bank would not be able to pay its debts when due or if the banks assets would be inadequate in a dissolution to pay liabilities and preferential rights similarly the banks board must consider current and prospective needs in making a decision to declare a dividend in addition in order to pay cash dividends the bank must obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve and the tdfi commissioner if the total of all dividends declared by the banks board of directors in any calendar year exceeds the total of i the banks retained net income for that year plus ii the banks retained net income for the preceding two years less certain required capital transfers as applicable below that ceiling approval generally is not required but see other factors affecting dividends immediately following this discussion applying the applicable rules at january the bank could legally declare cash dividends on the banks common or preferred stock totaling approximately million without obtaining approval the application of those restrictions to the bank is discussed in more detail in the following sections all of which is incorporated into this item by reference under the caption liquidity risk management in our mda item beginning on page of this report and under the caption restrictions on dividends in note 12regulatory capital and restrictions of our financial statements item beginning on page of this report other factors affecting dividends if in the opinion of the federal reserve fhn or the bank is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of fhn or the bank could include the payment of dividends the federal reserve may require fhn or the bank to cease and desist from that practice the federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institutions or holding companys capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice in addition under the federal deposit insurance act an fdicinsured depository institution such as the bank may not make any capital distributions pay any management fees to its holding company or pay any dividend if it is undercapitalized or if such payment would cause it to become undercapitalized the payment of cash dividends by fhn or by the bank also may be affected or limited by other factors such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines and requirements imposed by debt covenants for example as discussed under capital adequacy starting on page fhns ability to pay dividends would be restricted if its capital ratios fell below minimum regulatory requirements plus a capital conservation buffer the federal reserve generally requires insured banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends only out of current operating earnings the federal reserve has released a supervisory letter advising among other things that a bank holding company should inform the federal reserve and should eliminate defer or significantly reduce its dividends if i the bank holding companys net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters net of dividends previously paid during that period is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends ii the bank holding companys prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding companys capital needs and overall first horizon national corp form 10k annual report current and prospective financial condition or iii the bank holding company will not meet or is in danger of not meeting its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios transactions with affiliates the banks ability to lend or extend credit to fhn and its nonbank subsidiaries including for purposes of this paragraph in certain situations subsidiaries of the bank is restricted the bank and its subsidiaries generally may not extend credit to fhn or to any other affiliate in an amount which exceeds of the banks capital stock and surplus and may not extend credit in the aggregate to all such affiliates in an amount which exceeds of its capital stock and surplus extensions of credit and other transactions between the bank and fhn or such other affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances including credit standards that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies further the type amount and quality of collateral which must secure such extensions of credit is regulated there are similar legal restrictions on the banks purchases of or investments in the securities of and purchases of assets from fhn and its nonbank subsidiaries the banks loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of fhn and its nonbank subsidiaries the issuance of guaranties acceptances and letters of credit on behalf of fhn and its nonbank subsidiaries and certain bank transactions with fhn and its nonbank subsidiaries or with respect to which fhn and its nonbank subsidiaries act as agent participate or have a financial interest capital adequacy federal financial industry regulators require that regulated institutions maintain minimum capital levels the capital rules in the us are based on international standards known as basel iii those standards require the following table start common equity tier capital ratio for all supervised financial institutions including fhn and the bank the ratio of common equity tier capital to riskweighted assets common equity tier capital ratio must be at least to be well capitalized the common equity tier capital ratio must be at least common equity tier capital consists of core components of tier capital the core components consist of common stock plus retained earnings net of goodwill other intangible assets and certain other required deduction items at december fhns common equity tier capital ratio was and the banks was table endtable start tier capital ratio for all supervised financial institutions including fhn and the bank the ratio of tier capital to riskweighted assets must be at least table end to be well capitalized the tier capital ratio must be at least tier capital consists of the tier core components discussed in the bulleted paragraph immediately above plus noncumulative perpetual preferred stock a limited amount of minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock net of goodwill other intangible assets and certain other required deduction items at december fhns tier capital ratio was and the banks was table start total capital ratio for all supervised financial institutions including fhn and the bank the ratio of total capital to

institutions including fhn or the bank the leverage ratio must be at least to be well capitalized the leverage ratio must be at least the leverage ratio is tier capital divided by quarterly average assets net of goodwill certain other intangible assets and certain required deduction items at december fhns leverage ratio was and the banks was table endtable start leverage ratiosupplemental for the largest internationally active supervised financial institutions not including fhn or the bank a minimum supplementary leverage ratio must be maintained that takes into account certain offbalance sheet exposures table endtable start liquidity coverage ratio this requirement does not apply to institutions with assets of less than billion and so does not apply to fhn or the bank for larger institutions the requirement applies based on which category a bank is in categories iv iii and ii apply to banks with billion billion and billion respectively subject to several exceptions based on certain holdings activities or exposures category i includes systemically important institutions table end fhn believes that both fhn and the bank were in compliance with applicable minimum capital requirements as of december federal regulators have incorporated market and interestrate risk components into its riskbased capital standards those standards explicitly identify concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities and the management of such risks as important qualitative first horizon national corp form 10k annual report factors to consider in assessing an institutions overall capital adequacy federal regulators market risk rules are applicable to covered institutionsthose with aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities of at least of their total assets or at least billion fhn and the bank are covered institutions under the rule the rules specify the methodology for calculating the amount of riskweighted assets related to trading assets and include among other things the addition of a component for stressed value at risk the rule eliminates the use of credit ratings in calculating specific risk capital requirements for certain debt and securitization positions alternative standards of creditworthiness are used for specific standardized risks such as exposures to sovereign debt public sector entities other banking institutions corporate debt and securitizations in addition an capital surcharge applies to certain covered institutions not including fhn or the bank moreover the federal reserve has indicated that it considers a tangible tier capital leverage ratio deducting all intangibles and other indicia of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies including the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and to certain restrictions on its business and in certain circumstances to the appointment of a conservator or receiver see prompt corrective action pca immediately below for additional information in addition the bank is required to have a capital structure that the tdfi determines is adequate based on tdfis assessment of the banks businesses and risks the tdfi may require the bank to increase its capital if found to be inadequate prompt corrective action pca federal banking regulators must take prompt corrective action regarding fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements for this purpose insured depository institutions are divided into five capital categories the specific requirements applicable to us are summarized in the following table requirements for pca capitalization categories table start well capitalized common equity tier capital ratio of at least tier capital ratio of at least total capital ratio of at least leverage ratio of at least not subject to a directive order or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels adequately capitalized common equity tier capital ratio of at least tier capital ratio of at least total capital ratio of at least leverage ratio of at least not subject to a directive order or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels undercapitalized failure to maintain any requirement to be adequately capitalized significantly undercapitalized failure to maintain common equity tier capital ratio of at least tier capital ratio of at least total capital ratio of at least or a leverage ratio of at least critically undercapitalized failure to maintain a level of tangible equity equal to at least of total assets table end at december the bank had sufficient capital to qualify as well capitalized under the regulatory capital requirements discussed above an institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating institutions generally are not allowed to publicly disclose examination results an fdicinsured depository institution generally is prohibited from making any capital distribution including payment of dividends or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the federal reserve system in addition undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans an insured depository institutions holding company must guarantee the capital plan up to an amount equal to the lesser of of the depository institutions assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan for the first horizon national corp form 10k annual report plan to be accepted by the applicable federal regulatory authority the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator generally within days of the date on which they become critically undercapitalized holding company structure and support of subsidiary banks because fhn is a holding company its right to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the latters liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors including depositors in the case of the bank except to the extent that fhn may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary in addition depositors of a bank and the fdic as their subrogee would be entitled to priority over the creditors in the event of liquidation of a bank subsidiary under federal reserve policy fhn is expected to act as a source of financial strength to and to commit resources to support the bank this support may be required at times even though absent such federal reserve policy fhn might not wish to provide it in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment crossguarantee liability a depository institution insured by the fdic can be held liable for any loss incurred by or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with i the default of a commonly controlled fdicinsured depository institution or ii any assistance provided by the fdic to any commonly controlled fdicinsured depository institution in danger of default default is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver and in danger of default is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance the fdics claim for damages is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt other than affiliates of the commonly controlled insured depository institution currently the bank is the only depository institution owned by fhn if fhn were to operate another depository institution any loss suffered by the fdic in respect of one subsidiary bank would likely result in assertion of the crossguarantee provisions the assessment of such estimated losses against fhns other subsidiary banks and a potential loss of fhns investment in its subsidiary banks interstate branching and mergers as mentioned above the bank generally must have tdfis approval to establish a new banking center technically a branch for a new banking center located outside of tennessee tennessee law requires the bank to comply with branching laws applicable to the state where the new banking center will be located federal law allows the bank to establish or acquire a branch in another state to the same extent as a bank chartered in that other state would be allowed to establish or acquire a branch in tennessee for an interstate merger or acquisition the acquiring bank must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged concentration limits on liabilities and deposits may not be exceeded regulators must assess the transaction for incremental systemic risk and the acquiring bank must have at least satisfactory standing under the federal community reinvestment act discussed immediately below once a bank has established branches in a state through de novo or acquired branching or through an interstate merger transaction the bank may then establish or acquire additional branches within that state to the same extent that a bank chartered in that state is allowed to establish or acquire branches within the state community reinvestment act cra the cra requires each us bank consistent with safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of each community where the bank accepts deposits including low and moderateincome lmi communities the federal reserve assesses the bank periodically for cra compliance and that assessment is made public the banks lmi operations and activities generally are critical focal points in those assessments the next cra assessment is expected in or a cra rating below satisfactory can slow or halt a banks plans to expand by branching acquisition or merger and can prevent a bank holding company from becoming a financial holding company the bank received a rating of satisfactory in its most recent cra assessment issued in first horizon national corp form 10k annual report late in certain federal regulatory agencies proposed changes to their regulations under the cra although highly technical the proposal prompted several federal legislators to submit letters in opposition the federal reserve did not join the proposal so technically the proposal does not apply to fhn or the bank however this proposal could lead to some type of cra regulatory reform that the federal reserve does join or possibly legislation amending the cra financial activities other than banking federal law federal law generally allows financial holding companies broad authority to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity these include insurance underwriting and brokerage merchant banking securities underwriting dealing and marketmaking real estate development and such additional activities as the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental a bank holding company may engage in these activities directly or through subsidiaries by qualifying as a financial holding company to qualify as a financial holding company a bank holding company must file an initial declaration with the federal reserve certifying that all of its subsidiary depository institutions are wellmanaged and wellcapitalized federal law also permits banks to engage in certain of these activities through financial subsidiaries to control or hold an interest in a financial subsidiary a bank must meet the following requirements table start the bank must receive approval from its primary federal regulator for the financial subsidiary to engage in the activities table endtable start the bank and its depository institution affiliates must each be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged table endtable start the aggregate consolidated total assets of all of the banks financial subsidiaries must not exceed the lesser of of the banks consolidated total assets or billion subject to indexing for inflation table endtable start the bank must have in place adequate policies and procedures to identify and manage financial and operational risks and to preserve the separate identities and limited liability of the bank and the financial subsidiary table endtable start if the bank is one of the one hundred largest banks the bank must meet the longterm debt rating or alternative standards adopted by the federal reserve and the us secretary of the treasury from time to time if this fifth requirement ceases to be met after a bank controls or holds an interest in a financial subsidiary the bank cannot invest additional capital in that subsidiary until the requirement again is met table end no new activity may be commenced unless the bank and all of its depository institution affiliates have at least satisfactory community reinvestment act ratings certain restrictions apply if the bank holding company or the bank fails to continue to meet one or more of the requirements listed above in addition federal law contains a number of other provisions that may affect the banks operations including limitations on the use and disclosure to third parties of customer information at december fhn is a financial holding company and the bank has a number of financial subsidiaries as discussed in subsidiaries beginning on page of this report tennessee law tennessee law does not expressly restrict the activities of a bank holding company or its nonbank affiliates however no tennessee bank may maintain a branch office on the premises of an affiliate if the affiliate is engaged in activities that are not permissible for a bank holding company a financial holding company a national bank or a national bank subsidiary under federal law tennessee law permits tennessee banks to establish subsidiaries and to engage in any activities permissible for a national bank located in tennessee subject to compliance with tennessee regulations relating to the conduct of such activities for the purpose of maintaining bank safety and soundness interchange fee restrictions regulations severely cap interchange fees which the bank may charge merchants for debit card transactions volcker rule the volcker rule generally prohibits banks from engaging in proprietary trading which is engaging as principal for the banks own account in any purchase or sale of one or more of certain types of financial instruments and limits banks ability to invest in or sponsor hedge funds or private equity funds consumer regulation by the cfpb the cfpb adopts and administers significant rules affecting consumer lending and consumer financial services key rules for the bank include detailed regulation of mortgage servicing practices and detailed regulation of mortgage origination and underwriting practices the latter rules among other things establish the definition of a qualified mortgage using traditional underwriting practices involving down payments credit history income levels and verification and so forth the rules do not prohibit but do tend to discourage lenders from originating nonqualified mortgages data privacy security federal law restricts the banks ability to share certain information with affiliates and nonaffiliates for marketing first horizon national corp form 10k annual report andor nonmarketing purposes or to contact customers with marketing offers federal law also requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards data privacy and protection increasingly is a significant legislative regulatory and societal concern the concern is driven by major technological and societal shifts in the past years led by relatively unregulated firms such as amazoncom alibaba facebook and google and their many customers worldwide those firms have gathered large amounts of personal details about millions of people and today have the ability to analyze that data and act on that analysis very quickly these firms seek to understand enough about a person to know what a person wants before the person does banks as mentioned above already are subject to significant privacy regulations probably for that reason the banking industry is not at the political center of these concerns today even so banks are likely to be affected by broader legislative and regulatory responses to the perceived problems two prominent responses to date include the european union general data protection regulation and the california data privacy protection act neither is a banking industry regulation but both apply to banks in relation to certain customers to date neither has had a material impact on the bank fdic insurance assessments difa us bank deposits generally are insured by the deposit insurance fund dif the system of fdic insurance premium rates charged consists of a rate grid structure in which base rates range from to basis points annually and fully adjusted rates range from to basis points annually key factors in the grid include the institutions risk category i to iv whether the institution is deemed large and highly complex whether the institution qualifies for an unsecured debt adjustment and whether the institution is burdened with a brokered deposit adjustment other factors can impact the base against which the applicable rate is applied including for example whether a net loss is realized a basis point is equal to insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by a federal bank regulatory agency depositor preference federal law provides that deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including federal funds and letters of credit in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver securities regulation certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various securities laws and regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate our registered brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to the secs net capital rule rule 15c31 that rule requires the maintenance of minimum net capital and limits the ability of the brokerdealer to transfer large amounts of capital to a parent company or affiliate compliance with the rule could limit operations that require intensive use of capital such as underwriting and trading certain of our subsidiaries are registered investment advisers which are regulated under the investment advisers act of advisory contracts with clients automatically terminate under these laws upon an assignment of the contract by the investment adviser unless appropriate consents are obtained insurance activities certain subsidiaries sell various types of insurance as agent in a number of states insurance activities are subject to regulation by the states in which such business is transacted although most of such regulation focuses on insurance companies and their insurance products insurance agents and their activities are also subject to regulation by the states including among other things licensing and marketing and sales practices compensation and risk management the federal reserve has issued guidance intended to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at financial organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices the guidance is based on three key principles calling for incentive compensation plans to appropriately balance risks and rewards be compatible with effective controls and risk management and be backed up by strong corporate governance in response we operate an enhanced risk management process for assessing risk in incentive compensation plans several key incentive programs use a net profit approach rather than a revenuesonly approach and mandatory deferral features are used in several key programs including an executive program in federal agencies proposed regulations which could significantly change the regulation of incentive compensation programs at financial institutions the proposal would create four tiers of institutions based on asset size institutions in the top two tiers would be subject to rules much more detailed and proscriptive than are currently in effect if interpreted aggressively by the regulators the proposed rules could be used to prevent as a practical matter larger institutions from engaging in first horizon national corp form 10k annual report certain lines of business where substantial commission and bonus pool arrangements are the norm in the proposal the top two tiers included institutions with more than billion of assets fhn and the bank currently would fall into the third tier where the impact of the proposed rules would be substantially more modest and would move up to the second tier after the ibkc merger closes however prompted by post2016 legislation which significantly raised several statutory assetsize tiers if this proposal were finalized now the billion floor might be raised significantly allowing fhn to remain in the third tier fhn cannot predict what final rules may be adopted nor how they will be implemented table start effect of governmental policies table end the bank is affected by the policies of regulatory authorities including the federal reserve the tdfi and the cfpb the federal reserve also sets and manages monetary policy for the us in this latter role the federal reserves mandate from congress is to pursue price stability and full employment among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve are purchases and sales of us government and other securities in the marketplace changes in the discount rate which is the rate any depository institution must pay to borrow from the federal reserve changes in the reserve requirements of depository institutions changes in the rate paid on banks required and excess reserve deposits at the federal reserve and changes in the federal funds rate which is the rate at which depository institutions lend balances to each other overnight these instruments are intended to influence economic and monetary growth interest rate levels and inflation the monetary policies of the federal reserve and other governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future because of changing conditions in the national and international economies and in the money markets as well as the result of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities it is not possible to predict with certainty future changes in interest rates deposit levels loan demand or the business and results of operations of fhn and the bank or whether changing economic conditions will have a positive or negative effect on operations and earnings table start other proposals table end bills occasionally are introduced in the united states congress and the tennessee general assembly and other state legislatures and regulations occasionally are proposed by our regulatory agencies any of which could affect our businesses financial results and financial condition we are not able to predict what if any changes that congress state legislatures or the regulatory agencies will enact or implement in the future nor the impact that those actions will have upon us table start competition table end in all aspects of the businesses in which we engage we face substantial competition from banks doing business in our markets as well as from savings and loan associations credit unions other financial institutions consumer finance companies trust companies investment counseling firms money market and other mutual funds insurance companies and agencies securities firms mortgage banking companies hedge funds and other firms offering financial products or services regional banking our regional banking business primarily competes in several areas within the southeast us where we have banking center locations however competition in our industry is trending away from the traditional geographic footprint model that trend is happening throughout the industry but the rate of change is highly uneven among different types of customers products and services our regional banking business serves both consumer and commercial customers the consumer business remains strongly linked to our physical banking center locations even as our delivery of financial services to consumers becomes increasingly focused on popular nonphysical delivery methods such as online and mobile banking online and mobile banking have contributed to a decline in banking center usage but not so far an erosion of the link between banking center versus consumer customer location increasingly however consumers are able to manage their funds and financial affairs at multiple first horizon national corp form 10k annual report financial institutions through only one of them if cross institutional management features become popular they may hasten a delinking of consumers to traditional banking center networks the commercial business also has a geographic linkage but it is weaker some areas of our commercial banking business particularly in specialty lending are broadly regional or even national in scope rather than being heavily centered on banking center locations key traditional competitors in many of our markets include wells fargo bank na bank of america na firstcitizens bank trust company dba first citizens bank pinnacle bank headquartered in tennessee synovus bank truist bank and regions bank among many others including many community banks and credit unions additional key competitors in south florida are jpmorgan chase bank national association pnc bank national association and bankunited a number of recent technologies created or operated by nonbanks have been integrated into the financial systems used by traditional banks such as the evolution of atm cards into debitcredit cards and the evolution of debitcredit cards into smart phones these sorts of incrementally evolutionary technologies often have expanded the market for banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those services away from banks prior methods of delivering those services were disrupted but often at a pace which all but the weakest banks could accommodate recently some evolutionary pressures have arisen which may prove to be less incremental and more disruptive for example in financial planning and wealth management companies that are not traditional banks including both longestablished firms such as vanguard and new ones such as betterment have developed highlyinteractive systems and applications these services compete directly with traditional banks in offering personal financial advice the lowcost highspeed nature of these roboadvisor services can be especially attractive to younger less affluent customers and potential
