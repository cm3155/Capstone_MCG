call 21apr2020 this mornings speakers include our ceo bryan jordan our cfo bj losch and our chief credit officer susan springfield ill now turn it over to bryan d bryan jordan chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee thank you aarti good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call i hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe in this environment the covid19 health crisis is certainly unprecedented and causing significant economic uncertainty across the world not to mention here in the united states while early in the game im encouraged by the efforts of the federal reserve to provide liquidity and orderly markets and the stimulus passed by the congress and signed by president trump before we go into the quarterly trends ill talk about how were responding to the covid19 crisis were focused on supporting the wellbeing of our employees our customers and our communities for our employees we provided resources and flexibility to work remotely and offered extra sick time and financial assistance for childcare we understand how critical the role of banks is now and our employees are working incredibly hard to support customers and our communities our bankers are proactively reaching out to customers to discuss challenges and solutions were participating in the ppp program so far weve approved approximately applications and processed billion of loans were also working with our customers to provide payment deferrals liquidity loans and fee waivers on slide our business diversification combined with our strong capital and liquidity gives us a position of strength from which to successfully manage through the current economic challenges first quarter results demonstrated our solid foundation ppnr was up yearoveryear and reasonably steady linkedquarter driven by profitable balance sheet growth strong countercyclical business performance and excellent expense management earnings however were impacted by a million loan loss provision building reserves to incorporate the steep decline in the economic outlook in march we also adopted cecl accounting rule on january 1st net chargeoffs remain modest or million in the quarter we will continue to closely monitor and evaluate covid19s potential impact on the economy our customer base and our loan portfolio our current loan loss allowance represents of stress test losses over a nine quarter period as the full impact of the economic shutdown becomes clearer we will make appropriate adjustments if necessary balance sheet trends were strong with periodend loan and deposit growth of billion and billion respectively linkedquarter loan growth was driven by increases in loans to mortgage companies and higher line draws low rates drove an uptick in volume and loans to mortgage companies and draws increased from customers preparing for economic uncertainty periodend deposits reflected significant customer inflows so far in april weve seen deposit growth continue while line draws have moderated weve also seen some decline in loans to mortgage companies which increased sharply in the last week of march our capital and overall liquidity position remained strong with excess funding capacity that will allow us to continue to utilize our balance sheet to support our customers needs our periodend capital ratios were impacted by an increase in risk weighted assets primarily due to loan growth combined with an incremental provision bills first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 ill give a quick update on our merger and branch acquisition before turning the call over to bj to provide more financial details a merger of equals with iberiabank is on track weve made good progress in integration planning and processes and weve completed initial regulatory and shareholder filings our shareholder votes were set for april and the two major proxy advisory firms recommended votes for the merger we anticipate closing the merger by the end of the second quarter of after final regulatory approval regarding the branch acquisition weve agreed with truist to postpone finalizing the transaction until the third quarter due to the ongoing pandemic situation the postponement will alleviate customer disruption in this uncertain time and allow us to comply with social distancing guideline we believe both of these transactions will enhance our longterm value with improved funding additional earnings accretion and capital generation ill now turn the call over to bj to go through the financial highlights bj william c losch iii chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee great good morning and thanks everybody and i will start with financial results on slide yearoveryear highlights included strong ppnr nii growth on strong balance sheet growth and pricing discipline despite a tightening higher fixed income revenue and excellent expense management the nii was up yearoveryear due to strong commercial loan growth coupled with solid deposit pricing discipline with the linkedquarter decline driven by lower accretion and fewer days in the quarter fee income was up from continued strong performance from our fixed income business average daily revenues were million in the first quarter an increase of yearoveryear and up per day or linked quarter fixed incomes extensive distribution platform remains wellpositioned to capitalize on its favorable market conditions in todays environment the implementation of the new cecl loan loss methodology this quarter which as you know is supposed to be an estimate of lifetime losses in the credit portfolio contributed to a much higher provision from million in the fourth quarter to million in the first net chargeoffs were again very low at only million in the quarter with the additional provision increase driven by future economic factors in the models related to the covid19 pandemic ill get into more details on the reserve increase in a few minutes balance sheet trends were again strong on both the loan and deposit side particularly in the last five weeks of the quarter as you can see on slide we saw significant increases in our periodend loans with the vast majority of the growth occurring in the last week of the quarter linkedquarter total periodend loans were up billion about billion of the growth was related to loans to mortgage companies about million in the loan growth associated with line draws and about million was related to organic loan growth across the other commercial and consumer portfolios so far in april line draws have abated loans to mortgage companies balances are down from periodend levels and expected to come down about a billion to billion from periodend levels as purchase and refi volumes declined due to covid19 impacts in this uncertain environment our job is threefold in terms of lending number one utilize the government programs particularly ppp to get funds into the hands of those who need it two to keep credit flowing to strong credit worthy borrowers and three protect our balance sheet and capital levels and in this context where were seeing the majority of our lending are in areas that tick these boxes first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 over the next quarter we expect the majority of new loan growth to be driven by ppp loans which carry risk weighting we expect loans to mortgage companies given the industry dynamics related to covid19 impacts to come down meaningfully in the range of billion to billion from billion and we expect lines draws to occur but at lesser rates while new fundings decline and offset those incremental line draws turning to the positive trends on slide you see we saw strong deposit inflows towards the end of the quarter with balances of billion linkedquarter on a periodend basis the growth was driven by billion increase in market index deposits in march we saw a significant inflow of these balances as customers exited the equity markets and put their cash into fdic insured accounts additionally weve executed on an additional billion of insured network deposit contracts at attractive rates currently between basis points and basis points weve seen similar trends in april quartertodate deposits which are up by about billion or over billion levels the drivers of deposit growth in april are related to organic customer activity consumers receiving stimulus checks seasonal public funds and increases in non interestbearing commercial deposits as customers hold more cash in addition to continued inflows of market index deposits moving on to capital on slide as i noted earlier we had strong ppnr in the quarter that led to capital generation that supported the dividend and the increase to the provision as you can see on this slide the decline in cet1 ratio was due to the increase in riskweighted assets at the end of the month about points was related to commercial loan growth with a periodend uptick in loans to mortgage companies in addition to the increased line draws about basis points to the impact was related to higher market risk assets in our fixed income business the increase was largely driven by a large spike in value at risk due to the extreme volatility therefore as you all know capital ratios are calculated on periodend assets not average assets so even though average assets were roughly billion lower than periodend the capital ratio calculation is sensitive to the spot balance at the end of the quarter to put the impact of the periodend run up in assets in perspective the rule of thumb for us is that about a million increase in rwa is equal to about basis point capital ratio impact therefore that increase in billion in periodend assets over the last five weeks of the quarter versus the average assets in the quarter is about a basis point impact to the cet ratio said in different way if cet was calculated on average risk weighted assets versus periodend our cet ratio would have been about as ive said earlier when talking about loan growth we expect riskweighted assets to go down in the second quarter as loans to mortgage company balance sheet declined and new loan growth is driven primarily by riskweighted ppp loans with the expected reduction in rwa combined with continued strong ppnr we would expect our standalone cet ratio to move back more towards the range in the second quarter slide shows the drivers that changed under cecl adoption as you know cecl replaces the incurred loss methodology with a life of loan estimate concept while net chargeoffs were only million in the quarter the initial day one impact and the socalled economic factors related to the future economic outlook drove the aggregate increase in our reserves to put numbers to it as you can see in the walkforward the ending reserve as of was million weve indiscernible day one impact as of of million and subsequently by quarter end even though we had very little change in portfolio characteristics some things such as chargeoffs changes first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 or loan growth in the quarter following million and the economic factors the associated changes in the future economic outlook led to an additional million of reserves resulting in the lending loan loss reserve balance at million as of march we believe this represents a healthy reserve particularly when compared to both peers and our own severely adverse stress test which you can see on slide turning to slide there are several key points that id like to highlight here first as ph noted in the top of the list our total loan portfolio is predominantly commercially oriented at of total loans with a meaningful portion of them about considered investment grade equivalent and within that of those commercial loans at quarterend were loans to mortgage companies which as weve discussed many times carry minimal credit risk of loan to mortgage company balances are collateralized with government guaranteed loans while these loans are commercial loans and therefore carry a riskweighting if held individually on our balance sheet there would be riskweighted it is a very high quality portfolio second the consumer loans that we have are of high quality as well as evidenced by the high average refreshed fico scores and the lack of a meaningful higher loss content credit card exposure third about of our total loan portfolio still has million of unamortized loan mark in addition to million of reserves which provides additional loss absorption capacity and finally as you can see on the right hand side of this slide our reserve coverage to total loans and to  annualized net chargeoffs are very healthy relative to peers and we have prudently built reserves that equate to of our severely adverse modeled losses well above the peer averages and if you add in the additional million of unamortized loan mark were at approximately of our severely adverse modeled losses a very healthy number turning to slide since this is both the first quarter using the new cecl methodology and the factors related to the future economic outlook are such large drivers of both the size of the aggregate loan loss reserve and the first quarter provisions we thought it might be helpful to give you some details on our economic assumptions as few other regional banks we utilize various moodys scenarios and wait them to arrive at our quantitative modeled outputs we then use more severe scenarios on specific portfolios as wanted to come up with additional qualitative overlays to the modeled results so as you can see on this slide in the upper left our most heavily weighted baseline scenario has the following characteristics it considers the covid19 pandemic impacts including the cares act the fed stimulus including the open ended quantitative easing as well as the various announced liquidity and credit facility programs it assumes the fourth stimulus in the recession starting already in the first half of this year with only a partial bounce back in the third quarter then slow growth with acceleration of gdp growth not occurring till later in and no return to full employment until for certain select portfolios we still might have more stress such as aspects of the restaurant franchise finance or hospitality portfolios we used more severe moodys scenarios with characteristics such as in the upper right at the bottom we also laid out for you the epidemiological assumptions that corresponded with our various weighted scenarios then on slide we thought it might be helpful to graph out some of the key economic assumptions driving the loss estimates and compare them to our stress test assumptions on each of these graphs you have five lines the lighter dotted lines are the individual upside baseline and downside scenarios utilized the heavy blue line is the weighted average of the scenarios we utilize across our portfolios and the heavy grey line is the stress test assumptions few observations that i make here first on rates assumptions such as for the threemonth treasury yield and fed funds theyre very similar on both gdp and unemployment the current weighted scenarios showed a deeper gdp drop and steeper spike in unemployment initially but over the following months the severely adverse assumptions are worse for longer and for key price indexes such as cre or home prices or the dow index for equity markets the stress test assumptions are worse of near and longer term first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 well the outlook obviously remains uncertain a key difference between the stress test assumptions and the current environment to be determined is the ultimate effectiveness of the massive federal reserve liquidity programs and the unprecedented financial stimulus programs via the cares act regardless with our reserves as of at of our severely adverse modeled stress test losses we believe we have been proactive in building healthy loan loss reserves for an uncertain environment wrapping up this section on slide i wanted to remind you of our stress test results to show the resiliency of our business first our ppnr earnings power remained strong due to our countercyclical business and fixed income and we are seeing that countercyclicality play out currently and second the lower loss content mix of our credit portfolio with a meaningful portion of ci and very low risk loans to mortgage companies and underweight cre portfolio and a de minimis credit card portfolio should serve us well in a stressed environment with that ill turn it over to susan to give you a little bit more color on our credit portfolio susan l springfield chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee thanks bj good morning everyone ill start with slide which gives an overview of how our loan portfolio has evolved over the past years since the last financial crisis since we have meaningfully reduced our real estate exposure and exited certain riskier portfolios as bj said our loan portfolio is now commerciallyoriented with more than of our loans ph would map to an investment grade rating and the portfolio is diversified by product categories and geography ph note also on this slide our low cre to total capital ratios versus peers during this time we felt indiscernible and credit leadership with significant experience in underwriting within our commercial loan portfolio specialty areas comprised about half of that this specific industry knowledge about these teams allows us to have strong client selection and strong underwriting discipline and will provide expertise in navigating through this unprecedented economic crisis now ill turn to slide this slide shows the detail of our commercial loans portfolio based on naics industry codes our loan balances are across several sectors in ci weve also broken up certain commercial real estate balances as well as as well the overall ph free portfolio is diversified across property types and geography we remain disciplined in acquiring significant equity across property types and have sized new loan amounts in our cre book using a minimum underwriting rate that was typically basis points or more higher than the prevailing rates at the time of underwriting this type of underwriting built some conservatism into the portfolio at the initial origination across all our portfolios we believe weve taken the right approach to risks and have been prudent in our credit disciplines ill go over some of the specific portfolios in the next three slides on slide first take a look at healthcare portfolio its diversified among physicians offices medical centers hospitals and residential facilities this billion of average balances includes the healthcare specialty area as well as other healthcare related loans on our balance sheet the energy portfolio is million or about of our total loan portfolio about half of the energy portfolio is comprised of reserve based loans with approximately of reserve based borrower revenues hedged through and with approximately hedged through the remainder of energy portfolio is diversified between midstream compression refineries terminals storage and other oil field services indiscernible with the price volatility in the energy market these are portfolios that we discussed on a very regular basis first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 on slide ill go with the hospitality and restaurants portfolios the hospitality portfolio is about million with roughly three quarters of it related to hotel in this hotel portfolio more than of flagged hotels ph and are predominantly business traveler oriented with very few properties and reserve resort destination categories the average loan size for our hotel loans is about million the restaurant portfolio is billion of average balances and includes the billion franchise finance specialty area these borrowers are experienced business owners and have typically had access to multiple sources of capital and where about of our borrowers have more than locations as weve talked about previously about twothirds of this portfolio is limited service meaning fast food representing well known concepts the full service restaurants are mostly family style restaurants and have limited exposure to fine dining i should note that the franchisors are working closely with their franchisees during this time in a number of ways deferring discounting or waiving marketing fees and royalty fees lowering prices on supplies that are provided by the franchisor so in addition to the government programs we are seeing work across different segments trying to help businesses during this difficult time on slide i will talk about loans to mortgage companies one of our special key areas that we talk about every quarter periodend balances were billion as bj noted earlier over a billion of the growth came in the last five days of the quarter the growth reflected elevated levels of typical month end increases driven by large by increased refinance activity loans to mortgage companies are countercyclical business since loan rates tend to drive mortgage activity the loans to mortgage companies include collateral that are government guarantee mitigating most of the credit risk as bj noted earlier if these loans were directly on our balance sheet they would require only a percent risk weighting we have over years of experience in this business and our balance sheet capacity knowledge stringent focus on operational control and expertise have led to increased market share with our commercially oriented diverse loan portfolio and our consistent balanced approach to risk in addition to our reserve build associated with cecl adoption and the increase associated with the unknown economic impacts of covid we believe we are well positioned to weather the current crisis ill try turn it back to bryan for the wrapup d bryan jordan chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee thank you susan on slide were excited about our merger of equals with iberiabank we see it is clearly transformative weve made a great deal of progress planning the integration the merger strengthens our presence in key markets diversifies our loan portfolio both geographically and in industry concentrations and it gives us a unique a unique opportunity to drive greater efficiency from the day we announced the merger weve each been comfortable with the combined loan portfolios and while the economy has changed due to the coronavirus pandemic i believe together we are a stronger and better institution positioned to drive attractive shareholder returns and strong earnings accretion while these are clearly unusual times i believe we are well prepared to deal with the fall out of covid19 we have a strong capital and liquidity base weve maintained consistently strong underwriting standards and have built a diversified portfolio that is focused on profitability and our loan loss allowance is strong we have good expense controls in place and very importantly we have solid underlying earnings power first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 were facing an economic environment that differs from many in the past but were also seeing unprecedented government programs aimed at mitigating covid19s economic effects and hopefully leading to a quicker recovery our company ph stands ready to continue to assist our employees our customers and the community in an effort to overcome covid19s impact and revitalize the economy the health and safety of our employees remains of utmost importance its almost unimaginable the amount of work that our folks did over the last several weeks to help the treasury and the sba rollout the ppp and really serve our customers and communities teams of people working around the clock grateful for all of the dedication and commitment that my colleagues have shown in dealing with these unprecedented times many of them working remotely so thank you for all that you are doing and with that nick well now turn it over to you and ask for questions question and answer section operator well now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions first question comes from steven alexopoulos jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning everybody william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee hey steve susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start on reserves if we look at the reserve build it seems fairly aggressive in terms of the reserve covering of dfast losses which is well above peers now we look at most banks theyre at risk for another sizable reserve increase in just given the outlook and the economy seems to have worsened since how do you guys think about this for first horizon do you think youre at risk also or do you feel like with the assumptions youve made which seem more harsh than others that youve gotten ahead of the curve william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee hey steve its bj good morning so we obviously as i talked about use the moodys economic scenarios which were done very late in the quarter and then even through april we continue to monitor the economic assumptions ph until while we ran our models using weightings from the moodys scenarios as i talked about earlier we also overlaid qualitative reserves on top of those specifically stressed sectors to make sure that we were trying to take into account as much as we knew at the end of the quarter to be able to build as first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 healthy a reserve and try to follow what is supposed to be the ph role around cecl which is truly estimating your lifetime losses as of a period ending and so with all of those factors we try to be as we tried to be over the last plus years very prudently conservative in terms of transparency and how we built those reserves and so as you talked about weve built it much more towards a severely adverse environment clearly the unknown going forward is what does the economy ultimately do how do borrowers actually behave how do the stimulus programs and the unprecedented fed programs ultimately soften the impact but those are hopeful and what we wanted to do is make sure that we were building as healthy a reserve as we possibly could right now so next quarter as we would in any given quarter well reevaluate our existing portfolio and the portfolio changes as well as any new economic factors over the next days and reevaluate but the bottom line is we feel very good about the healthy reserves that we built this quarter d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee hi steve this is bryan to add on to bjs comment this is an environment that we sit around and we like the rest of the world clearly have a lot of things we dont know what we dont know and maybe more than any other environment in my career there are more known ph and unknowns than weve seen at any point in time and ph as you really if you go back to the timeframe was to make sure that we provide as much transparency about whats in our portfolios and we try to be realistic not overly conservative but realistic and conservative about what we think the lifetime losses are in the portfolio and lay that out for our investor base and our regulators as well at the end of the day our risk profile is very very different today than it was in and but weve taken the same approach which is to be realistic to take what we do think the economic environment looks like and as bj said use a moodys baseline in those portfolios that we think will be adversely impacted use more severe scenarios around them but again ph provide transparency and be realistic about how we think it plays now as bj said facts on the ground is unchanged were all going to know a lot more in days and we know that the day were going to know a lot more are days and well make adjustments as necessary steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats helpful maybe for susan can you give us a sense as to the loans which you provided deferrals modifications in the quarter maybe the overall balance and maybe some color on which segments susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee certainly so if i look at the deferrals that we provided business purpose deferrals was beyond about billion worth of underlying loan balances of that about million would be what i consider small business the two biggest portfolios as you would imagine we had about million in cre or about of the cre book and about ph not quite of the franchise finance and then the remainder within just what i would call core ci so we are dedicated to working with these great customers who are experiencing this difficulty relating to the pandemic and believe that this could be a factor in addition to the government programs that can help get them beyond this point in addition to that on the consumer side we have had deferrals on traditional consumer of about million of balances and mortgage about million first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you susan susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee ph now i think it was mentioned earlier i think it was mentioned earlier about in fees waived william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee ph about steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then finally for bj i know its almost impossible to forecast the margin here but in terms of just the ability to absorb losses can you talk about do you think you can grow net interest income in the coming quarter with all the pressure on nim and offsets on ppp thanks brady gailey a analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah so we do have a slide slide if you want to look at our net interest margin and net interest income trends in the appendix but yeah i think in terms of nii i think there is going to be continued pressure as we expect libor to continue to come down its remained more elevated than i think any of us would have thought given the rapid decline in fed funds but we expect that to continue to come down though it hasnt yet come down to where we think it will be so thatll continue to be a headwind our teams have done an excellent job both taking care of customers and growing deposits while also remaining very disciplined around pricing whether its base rates earnings credit rates promo rates retention rates et cetera and as you can see in the quarter we brought deposit rates down quite significantly and i would expect that to continue into the second quarter so that will be helpful as well i would expect that those two the net impact will probably be a net negative because libor and our floating rate loans would come down more indiscernible bring down deposit costs but as you said the ppp program particularly around the fees that we will generate from the billion of fundings that we are making will flow through the net interest income line and hopefully be able to offset any of the net negative in terms of the rate dynamic so all of that to say is i do think that we can hold our net interest income relatively steady with the addition of the ppp fees steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc perfect i appreciate all the color thanks d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee thanks steve first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee thanks steve operator next question from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning brady gailey a analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee good morning william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee hi ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey i guess bryan just following up to your comments relative to i think theres one like you provided lot of details on the portfolio like at what point like whats your level of comfort around the portfolio as someone who took the bank indiscernible to the bank in ran it through the crisis through the ph cleanup when you look at the portfolio do you see a realistic risk where losses exceed your severe loss estimates because i think the numbers you can all look at you should be able to own it even if you have million instead of million that youve reserved today but just talk to us in terms of the portfolio around and just your confidence around like that number is probably the high watermark when you think about losses d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so as i think about the portfolios today versus and i dont think theres any comparison at all the risk profile in the portfolio is completely different we dont have the national business we dont have all of the residential construction we dont have all of the nonfootprint home equity exposures and we didnt have a lot of the we dont have the corresponding portfolios that we had in today we have made a very conscious effort over a 10year period to transform the way we underwrite the way we document the collateral and there was a slide i dont recall which one theres a slide in there bj showed page that shows the risk ratings and the portfolio and sort of the evaluation but i would suggest that i have a very high degree of confidence in our underwriting in our portfolio management first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 we have transformed intentionally our mantra has been we want a portfolio that we will be proud of in any cycle and this would qualify in any cycle and we believe that this portfolio will perform well clearly our losses will go up as everybodys will but we think this portfolio will hold up and perform very very well and so i think its very little comparison to and if the framework that people are applying how do we do in and how were going to perform to date its night and day i think the portfolio performance will be vastly different and vastly better in this cycle ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess susan just following up on that what percent like do you know what percentage of your restaurant finance customers were or totally business customers were qualified for the ppp program susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee you asked about franchise finance customers ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc right susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee indiscernible youre applying ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah how many qualified for ppp yeah susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah we over of our franchise finance customers have applied for ppp ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it got it and in terms of the mortgage warehouse like of the collateral government gsebacked mortgages is there any risk in terms of the warehouse where a mortgage company runs into trouble like do you see any meaningful credit risk there or not susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee i really dont we thought that is governmentbacked another or is jumbo and really conforms in every other way except for the loan size and a small amount of noncumulative d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 our experience ebrahim with those portfolios is even when weve had to manage out of a position the collateral is liquid it is we liquidated and we get out of the position and so we see it as more of an operational risk portfolio than a credit risk portfolio as susan just reiterated as you pointed out its a highly liquid almost essentially a conforming gse eligible portfolio so we see it as very little credit risk and its really most important that we stay focused on what weve always been focused on is that we have good title to good collateral ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee the other thing ebrahim is that these mortgage warehouse customers were highly profitable through and yeartodate and so their ability should you have a mortgage or two that cant go into the permanent market their ability to pull it back amortize it take it back from us is their ability to do that has been increased because of the profitability that theyve had in and year to date ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and if i can sneak in one last for bj when i look at your amended s4 for march stocks come down just help us think through around how the pro forma capital ratio tangible book looks coming out of the iberia deal if you could provide some colors that would be helpful william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so clearly with significant moves in the stock price theres been some talk around do you have goodwill or do you have a bargain purchase gain in those those types of things and really when it comes down to its none of that really fundamentally changes the tangible common equity that youll get from the transaction so the tangible common equity will be the same whats going to change as we get closer to close is clearly the fair value marks that were going to be looking at on a portfolio from a credit perspective or an interest rate of liquidity mark perspective as well as the mix of pcd purchase credit deteriorated versus nonpcd loans in that mix and how well have to account for those so were clearly going through all of that work right now and as brian talked about we anticipate closing the transaction towards the end of the second quarter and well be doing our calculations on fair value marks as of that day ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc well thanks for taking my questions d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee sure operator next question is from brady gailey with kbw please go ahead first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee hi brady susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee hi brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so when you look at some of the categories in your loan book that would be deemed higher risk like energy hotel restaurant healthcare i mean none of these exposures are big for first horizon which is good but when you look at the riskier exposures which categories are you most concerned about actually losing money as this you know current economic status continues susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee brady clearly we stress several portfolios were heavily as weve previously discussed and the immediate impact to hospitality and restaurants was significant and then within the healthcare sector since all nonelective procedures and visits who indiscernible thats where weve seen the most requests for assistance either in deferrals or liquidity line what we dont know as weve talked about previously is that the stimulus is healthier and the additional stimulus that is planned to be out there with another round of ppt the main street lending program to specific programs for healthcare hospitals it could in that being better than it looks right now because weve not seen an economic environment with this much stimulants so even while we believe those portfolios are probably more riskbased on whats going on today which is why we did stress some of those portfolios a little bit more heavily really indiscernible the next to days i think all of us will see what is the impact and then the other thing that ive been thinking technical difficulty as we think about managing this portfolio not just the what happened during the shutdown its what patterns of behavior change and how does that drive different things so i think we will all have to go through this together and see how we emerge from the present pandemic brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful and then you know first indiscernible there has been great operating leverage and lowering its expense base and getting the efficiency ratio down i mean when you look at the company now especially with whats going on with higher provision costs and the net interest margin coming in is there opportunity to go back and look at the expense side even more to harvest some more savings at this point d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 hi brady this is bryan i appreciate the confidence and our ability to manage it i think our team has done a very good job and we saw indiscernible and we had in our expense base of million roughly for the increase in our reserve for unfunded commitments if you take those things out we showed good expense leverage in the first quarter from fourth quarter and from a year ago we will have a fair amount of work to do and we think that there are opportunities to control some costs in the categories of known unknowns its not clear today of what our work footprint looks like today we have about or more of our people who are working remotely how do we have to space people out and some of those things but we do think that there is operating leverage that we can get in the foreseeable future the other thing that i pointed out when i commented about iberia bank when we do that merger of equals we still feel very strongly that we can get at least million of cost savings out of that combination and those are costs that neither one of us could get at if we werent doing that merger so in essence we have a cost tailwind by completing that merger that also allows us to restructure our entire combined cost base and so i think there is opportunity for leverage on the cost structure but there are some things about the operating environment that will need another days or so to figure out how it impacts us brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and then lastly for me bj when youre talking about the mortgage warehouse coming down billion to billion youre talking about end of period balances correct william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee correct yeah yeah so you saw i think on one of our slide brady that literally in the last five days of the quarter we saw loans to mortgage companies go up by about billion or billion so a huge huge spike and we actually show you the day by day chart from to of what loans from mortgage companies did so if you go back five weeks before the end of the quarter it was almost billion change over five weeks so significant run out we expect that to come back down in that billion to billion range from the periodend simply because on the purchase side weve seen a significant backup in reduction in applications as you might expect because of the covid19 pandemic and people just being very hesitant on new purchases and then even with refi theres still activity out there but a lot of it is just finishing what was already in process and if you think about having to do a refi there are appraisers that have to go into houses there are title companies and closing attorneys that actually have to be able to finalize the paperwork and with the stay at home orders and those types of things its made it much harder to actually get those things done so again the combination of those two we believe caused the spike at the end of the quarter but correspondingly we think will cause a reduction of a somewhat equal amount by the end of the second quarter d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee hey brady this is bryan to add to bj estimates vary but it was something like or so of the mortgage universe can benefit from these low rates and a refi environment and as bj said a lot of that started in the march timeframe and well see the pull through there are some structural issues that bj mentioned to further refi i think purchase volume which is a little less than half of the day continues to decline and quite depending on your outlook on the economy unemployment rates are going to have an impact on ability to refi so we think that theres natural downward pressure on that first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 we talk about that portfolio and its impact on the capital ratios and as that portfolio shrank those capital ratios go up one of the reasons that i dont worry in addition to the strength of the credit portfolio about the cet ratio at a given point in time is if the economy gets bad and that capital is more of an important factor that mortgage warehouse business is going to be probably a billion or billion portfolio its going to come down because the economy is bad those capital ratios go up in the neighborhood of basis points if that happens so that portfolio it will ebb and flow based on the economic environment and the impact of rates we like that business it is a business that has as susan said very strong customer base and it has been very attractive to us from a financial perspective so were not worried about what that portfolio does bj is sort of pointing out that its got a natural tendency down over the next couple of months so as youre modeling dont forecast that its almost billion in outstanding brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks guys operator next question comes from michael rose of raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey thanks guys d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee good morning michael michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc so it looks like if i take those core categories that you outlined is kind of higher risk its about of loans ex warehouse do you have a sense for what that looks like with iberia included like i know their energy portfolio is about and you guys are about proforma but do you have a sense for a what that would look like on a complexion basis and then b would you look to maybe deemphasize some of those portfolios or take a bigger market potentially on those portfolios once you consummate the deal thanks susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so ill speak to a couple of the portfolios that you mentioned your energy comment was correct on a combined basis on a commercial real estate in this time our commercial real estate overall they do have a larger commercial real estate book as a percentage of their portfolios than we do so that will go up but i do want to reiterate we did significant due diligence on each other during the process before the merger was announced and whilst the energy portfolio will go up somewhat indiscernible portfolio will go up a little bit more we do feel very good about the disciplined underwriting and client selection that both banks have employed and so i feel like well be able to manage through that i do think there probably is an expectation that over time as we are a bigger bank indiscernible but we would look for ways to continue to diversify the portfolio and clearly those could be areas where over time we first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 would want to deemphasize the growth there doesnt want to remain open for good customers once we get beyond this pandemic but at the same time thats another benefit of being a big organization is the ability to continue to diversify so thats really how were thinking about that but again prepandemic looking at the portfolio is very similar approach very disciplined approach to initial underwriting servicing and client production michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and maybe just one followup for me if i look at the ppp program just one or two questions there i think if i combine both you and what iberia announced last week its about billion how long would you expect those loans to stick around and then when you do combine the company do you expect to hold those loans as held for sale or held for investment because the way i understand is indiscernible for investment it will impact the margins but you hold it as held for sale the fees will go through noninterest income thanks d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah on that last question i think weve fully decided yet on which one we are going to do hfi or hfs so we are still working through that i think the terms are two years but the forgivable portion or that is much shorter so we would expect them to largely just stay on the balance sheet maybe through the balance of this year running down towards the end of the year william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee its got a zero risk weighting too michael and i think well also step back and look at the liquidity facility that the fed has provided because that looks like an attractive way to find these zero risk weighting but as you point out they are very low spread with a coupon rate and so weve been running as i said in my transition the question weve been running really really hard to get these loans under written booked and funded and so now well catch our breath and well figure out how we finance them on the balance sheet but we dont think its a problem either way either on the balance sheet or using the fed facilities and well so we will work through that over the next days or so d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah and forgive me for stating the obvious but what im obviously talking about is that what we just funded if the government does reup the program and comes on new well have it going on further but again the way i understand it is the fees as well as the spreads are included in the margin so we will once we figure out exactly how thats going to flow through and when you recognize the fees well certainly be transparent and disclose all of that michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay very helpful thank you d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee thank you first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 operator our next question comes from tyler stafford of stephens please go ahead tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc hey guys good morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee hi tyler d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee hi tyler william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee good morning tyler tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc hey i apologize i hopped on really late so im sorry if youve already covered this but i just had a question around the fixed income business this quarter it looks like the revenues out of that segment were up around million but the expenses were up around million and that theres a footnote that said that the fees were impacted by trading losses given the extreme market volatility so can you just i guess help parse out for us what is going on but i guess behind curtain in terms of the negative operating leverage this quarter and why that should move differently next quarter thanks william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah hey tyler its bj yeah so what we clearly saw in the quarter was the rapid change and increase in volatility which led to our higher market risk assets because of higher value at risk so indiscernible and team in fixed income did an excellent job working through our inventory and managing our exposures and marks over the last five weeks of the quarter but as they were repositioning the inventory and having to take those marks those trading losses day to day were coming through the revenue side but the actual activity of the sales force was fully commissionable that makes sense so though our abr was net about million in the quarter if you take out the trading losses the gross adr was more in the million range but netting out as trading losses it reduced the adr so your revenues led lower with the higher commissionable variable comp on the other side as they work through that inventory by the end of the quarter its very much better positioned such that going forward we believe were going to have much lower net trading losses and the gross adr and the net adr will be much more aligned and youll see the normal pattern start to reemerge between our incremental revenue growth and any incremental variable comp growth first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee thanks tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee this is bryan we refer to them as negative split you heard us say in the past were in the moving business were not in the storage business we move these portfolios through the balance sheet and the significant dislocations that happened particularly in the municipal bond marketplace some of the corporate marketplace and the volatility thats sort of erupted in the late march timeframe was largely stabilized by the efforts of the fed that i mentioned earlier to bring liquidity and stability to the marketplace so we think the majority of that has sort of work through the systems and there were days in there we would have volatility where we did a day i think it was about million in average daily revenue that netted down to about million with the negative split so there was a lot of activity and we think that the stability in the marketplace has largely put that behind as we think it all to move to more normalized levels depending on how things play out more normalized levels in the second quarter the second quarter is off to a decent start tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay thanks for that bryan and bj so i guess if some of these more extreme market volatility issues and trading losses have been cured at this point i mean do you expect i guess going back to bryan your last comment there to be more towards that gross or the net million or somewhere in between or whats your kind of nearterm expectation and what youre seeing d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee youll have to forgive me on the 21st day of april im not going to take the bait on that one so every stated revenues have been good theres couple of things that could impact the business that i think we will keep around one is financial institutions broadly speaking or funding ppp loans in a number of our customers until they can put loans into the facility that will constrain liquidity so that could have some impact on the bond business and i think our total return business continues to look good were optimistic about the outlook for the quarter and as we started off days or so is the trend were starting off in the same area we ended the first quarter and so we feel good about the outlook but its way too early in the quarter and obviously theres too many unknowns about the economy and how this is going to play out over a day period tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc sure thats totally fair thanks bryan and then just one more for me on the mortgage warehouse business how much of the mortgage clients or balances are to mortgage originators versus mortgage servicers first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee its almost exclusively mortgage ventilators we have very little mortgage services closure william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee there is some of our customers that will serve us but we dont really finance in the space our lending as against the originations tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay very helpful thats it for me thanks guys d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee thank you william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee thanks tyler operator our next question comes from garrett holland of baird please go ahead garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc good morning thanks for taking the questions d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee hi garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc i appreciate all the detail but could you help us understand the sensitivity and the reserve level and the potential reserve build if you weighted the cecil forecast more towards your downside economic assumptions versus the baseline employee for the current reserve level at william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so let see to try to give you a sense of the magnitude i think the pure downside model would probably be doing this ive got my head about more than what the baseline would be to more so i think we took that into account in terms of a our weightings of baseline upside and downside as well as what we talked about particularly around the sectors where we thought they were most vulnerable to that downside and might not have as much support from the various stimulus programs or the fed facilities that others might have so we took first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 all of that into account using quantitative modeling multiple discussions on qualitative modeling and overlays and feel comfortable about how weve looked at the aggregate reserve to this point garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc thanks bj and then just a followup on iberia obviously a lot of change in the micro front and change out to the deal and heard the reiteration of the cost savings projections so do you still feel good about the timeframe for realizing those benefits and maybe some of the pro forma profitability metrics d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah this is bryan so if i take it in reverse order can you tell me what the economy is going to be at the end of and i can tell you better about the pro forma profitability metrics but i think over time yes i feel very good about our ability to get to the pro form profitability metrics i think by we have forecasted about of the cost saves in and being at a run rate by the end of i still feel good about that and our ability to achieve that itll be interesting to see how the first year plays out we might be a little shy in year one simply because of all of the needs to support ppp and the market that were in but we think by the time we get to the end of the year even then we will be at our cost reduction level in so we still feel good about it we still feel good about our ability to hit the pro forma profitability numbers were not sure that will be or will be back to economy but given that it is we feel good about our performance garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc thats helpful and then just wanted to ask you a quick one about the dividend payout here obviously capital indiscernible but wanted to confirm how youre thinking about that claim on capital thank you for taking questions d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah sure so we think that returning capital to our shareholders is important and bj pointed out in several slides from the deck and in the appendix our stress testing and our stress testing through most of our adverse scenarios we assume that we continued with the dividend at current levels and thats our working assumption that we continue to manage the dividend at current levels and we believe that capital adequacy is sufficient pre provision earnings even net of provisions will be adequate to clearly support the return of capital to our shareholders garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc thanks bryan i appreciate it d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee youre welcome first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 operator operator instructions our next question comes from jennifer demba of suntrust please go ahead d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee hey jennifer jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you good morning hi bryan what do you think the longterm implications of this pandemic shutdown are going to be on first horizon whether it would be less need for office space or other implications d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah we started a good bit of time talking about that and we think there are a number of things operationally office space and in the short run how to clean office spaces and things of that nature how you protect customers that come in your financial centers its interesting im doing this off the top of my head all of our financial centers are open most of the activity is happening in a drivethru facility our transactions are down but were doing all of it through drivethru facilities and in some ways you almost have to smile because were using old technology to serve customers a drive up facility clearly customers are using call centers they are using online technology i do think that well have to figure out how we cope with social distancing probably for you know you need to believe the epidemiologists for year two maybe longer i think people have gotten much more comfortable and were much more comfortable in our ability to work remotely weve done the vast majority of the ppp work on a remote basis so i think we have more people working remotely well probably need less office space and centralized facility within those spaces well probably spread people out more i think customers over time will do less business in financial centers because theyve gotten closer to technology and using the tools that are available to them so i think it is a opportunity to really rethink how we do business and thats one of the things that as we plan for the integration or the merger of vehicles with iberiabank is we think about how does this change our business longterm and as we make our systems and process decisions lets think about what this educates us about customers and customer preference and the likelihood of doing business so i think more remote banking spread out more and more social distancing and using more technology to serve customers in unique and different ways
