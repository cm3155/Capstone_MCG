natalie good morning everyone thank you for joining our call before we get into the details of the quarter i want to express our concern and support for those who were impacted by hurricanes helene and milton im incredibly proud of our team how our team prepared for and responded to the needs of our associates clients and communities we were on the ground immediately providing food water fuel and other essential supplies in north carolina and tennessee all but one of our banking centers are back open with mobile banking units on site there to provide continuous banking services to our clients florida is in the early stages of recovery but our banking centers fared well and all are open at this time weve also announced financial commitments to the restoration of these communities and will remain heavily engaged in the rebuilding process on slide weve shared some of the financial highlights for the quarter first horizon delivered another strong quarter for our shareholders as we grew revenue maintained expense discipline improved credit coverage and continued to generate capital our results this quarter reflect the strength of our diversified business model and our continued focus on growing and deepening client relationships we achieved an adjusted eps of per share which was a increase from the prior quarter pre provision net revenue increased million improving our adjusted return on tangible common equity to we continue to deploy capital through share repurchases buying back million of stock in the third quarter and over million yeartodate we ended the quarter with a common equity tier ratio of our results continue to demonstrate the benefit of our disciplined credit culture as we sold just million or basis points of net chargeoffs this quarter im proud of the dedication of our bankers that our bankers display in serving our clients and communities throughout the southeast i believe we are wellpositioned to capitalize on our attractive footprint and opportunities to grow along with these markets as we head into next year i remain incredibly optimistic that our franchise is fully equipped to navigate any economic environment we encounter while continuing to enhance shareholder value with that ill hand the call over to hope to run through our financial results in more detail hope hope dmuchowski senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you bryan good morning everyone on slide you will find our adjusted financials and key performance metrics for the quarter we generated adjusted earnings per share of a increase from prior quarter preprovision net revenue improved by million from last quarter largely due to strong performance from our fixed income business while our net interest income and adjusted expenses remained essentially flat we continue to see solid credit performance from our portfolio with net chargeoffs of basis points and million of provision expense acl coverage increased modestly to including million of qualitative reserves for potential losses related to hurricane helene the improved revenue and lower reserve build drove an first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 increase in our adjusted return on tangible common equity to our cet1 ratio increased to modestly above our nearterm target driven by lower than expected riskweighted assets due to a late in the quarter portfolio sale on slide we outline a couple of notable items in the quarter which reduced results by per share third quarter pretax notable items include a million credit to expenses that was trued up to the fdic special assessment accrual a million of visa derivative valuation expenses related to the escrow funding that occurred in september and lastly million of restructuring expenses associated with the operational efficiencies we have continued to identify all of this totals an million reduction to net income on slide you will see that nii of million was relatively stable to the prior quarter benefiting slightly from a higher day count the net interest margin compressed basis points from last quarter to with better asset yields partially offsetting higher deposit costs the increase in average deposit costs was driven by higher use of brokered deposits as well as acquisition costs on the billion of new client growth loan yields expanded basis points from second quarter benefiting from new and renewing floating rate spreads and repricing of fixed rate cash flows as we move into the fourth quarter we expect modest margin contraction due to lag between the loan and deposit repricing on slide we take a closer look at our strong deposit growth period end balances increased with client acquisition driving almost billion of growth we are also pleased to see that noninterestbearing balances have continued to remain relatively stable over the last few quarters the average rate paid on interestbearing deposits increased to from the spot rate we saw at the end of june this was driven in part by the higher use of brokered deposits as seasonality in loans to mortgage companies drove a higher need for funding deposit costs are already beginning to improve with the interestbearing spot rate declining to approximately by the end of september partially due to the billion of deposits which are market indexed deposit rates have declined another basis points in october with a spot rate today of we will continue to make progress on repricing the deposit portfolio as we have approximately billion of promotional deposits that are set to reprice over the remainding sic remainder of the year in addition to the billion of brokered cds that are maturing on slide we have an overview of loans average loans were up from the prior quarter driven by seasonality in loans to mortgage companies period end loans declined or million from last quarter this included an opportunistic sale of approximately million as we exited the sponsored health care lending vertical the portfolio consisted of approximately relationships of higher leverage lowpass graded health care loans we do not have the intent to sell any other loan portfolios in the foreseeable future after a period of fundups in our commercial real estate portfolio the balances in this portfolio have stabilized as previously mentioned loan yields were up basis points from second quarter due to wider spreads and fixed cash flow repricing as we move into the fourth quarter loan yields are likely to decline as of our loan portfolio is indexed to shortterm rates on slide we highlight the increase in fee revenue we saw in the quarter fee income excluding deferred compensation increased million from the prior quarter average daily revenue in our fixed income business improved to driving a million increase in fee income july was a relatively muted month first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 however as the market confidence and rate cuts increased we saw increasing momentum in the business in both august and september lastly other noninterest income increased million due to some nonrecurring items including securities and other gains higher federal home loan bank dividends and boli benefits on slide we show that excluding deferred compensation adjusted expenses decreased by million personnel excluding deferred comp was down million from prior quarter as a reduction in incentives and commissions offset the impact of a higher day count on salary expense and elevated medical expense the million reduction to incentives included the continued stepdown in retention awards that took place at the end of the second quarter and outweighed the incremental incentives associated with the higher fixed income production we are constantly evaluating options to improve operational efficiency this quarter we implemented two items that impacted head count first we optimized the retail staffing model across our footprint to more efficiently serve our clients we also recently outsourced our property management functions which lowered head count and salary expense but will be offset by some incremental occupancy cost we expect this to make our building support more efficient while providing a better experience for our clients and associates moving down to occupancy and equipment there was a million increase driven by our new property management engagement as well as incremental software maintenance and depreciation from our strategic initiatives offsetting the increase is a million reduction to outside services driven by lower advisory services as certain strategic initiatives enter the production phase ill cover credit on slide which continues to perform very well net chargeoffs decreased by million to million or basis points of average loans loan loss provision was million this quarter increasing acl coverage to the million of reserve build included million of qualitative reserves related to hurricane helene as well as the impact of continued grade migration which was partially offset by improved economic scenarios nonperforming loans increased million with an increase in ci slightly exceeding declines in consumer and commercial real estate we remain optimistic that our clients can navigate to a soft landing as of commercial npls are still current on their payments overall we are very pleased with the continued strength of our portfolio through a high rate environment and expect to see continual improvement if rates do continue to decline on slide well talk through our outlook for the remainder of the year what we have laid out here is consistent with the guidance we gave last quarter though we are now focusing more on total revenue versus the individual components we believe total revenue will be flat to up yearoveryear with the composition driven by what the fed chooses to do over the next couple of months our countercyclical businesses are a natural hedge against our asset sensitivity if we see incremental declines in interest rates those businesses revenues will offset that incremental nii pressure turning to expenses our guidance remains unchanged as we remain committed to continuing to identify efficiencies to help offset our investments for net chargeoffs you can see that we are trending favorably to our guidance but we have left the range unchanged until we have more information on the potential for losses that could arise from the recent weather events in our footprint lastly we continue to target an cet1 ratio near term first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 ill wrap up as we turn to slide i am proud of all the progress we have made as a company so far this year we are focused on improving profitability while making the strategic enhancements needed to set us up for success as we continue to grow the franchise as a leadership team we remain extremely optimistic about the future of first horizon and are excited to continue delivering value to our shareholders and a premier banking experience for our clients now ill give it back to bryan d bryan jordan chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you hope many of you have heard me say that our goal is to stack one good quarter on top of the next this quarter added momentum to that track record and puts us one step closer to achieving our longer term return goals as an organization we are intently focused on execution we aim to improve revenue through client growth and retention while maintaining expense discipline through operational excellence we will continue to align capital and resources with the greatest business opportunities while enhancing our technology capabilities to deliver exceptional client experience i remain confident that our diversified business model including our wellestablished countercyclical businesses will allow us to continue to deliver strong shareholder value over the remainder of and into next year our associates dedication combined with our attractive footprint and extraordinary client base positions us to build an unparalleled banking franchise in the southeast thank you to our associates for all that you do for our clients communities and for each other carly we can now open it up for questions first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you bryan operator instructions our first question comes from ebrahim poonawala bank of america ebrahim your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc maybe bryan hope indiscernible it makes sense in terms of talking about total revenue versus nii fees given the countercyclicality of your businesses but just talk to us i guess the question there in case in the very near term nii i think hope you mentioned a margin compression over the next quarter or two will impact nii when we look at the fixed income business the million in fees this quarter is it as good as it gets in terms of the upper bound on this or whats like weve seen a fair amount of bond book restructuring in their banks rates rate got cut rates got cut or is there another leg higher to go on additional rate outlooks certainty would love for you to address that hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning ebrahim this is hope happy to answer that question i mentioned in my comments that we saw a very muted july so we absolutely think we see some upside if we continue to see rates decline as september and august were much stronger than july and weve seen strong momentum ending the quarter the one thing you mentioned was were people still buying we had a conversation with our business the other day if rates go down another basis points this year theyve already talked to some clients that locked things that earlier this year that late last year that are thinking about restructuring again and so i do think therell be continued momentum in a decreasing rate environment ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and just the other question was around the loantodeposit ratio i think you called out the decline from to partly driven by the some of the actions you took during the quarter i know we talked about this in the past just remind us when you look at the loantodeposit ratio is there a certain level to which youre managing to and as a result is that kind of making you a little bit more cautious in terms of how quickly you flex deposit pricing lower first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee we continue to monitor our loantodeposit ratio but we also monitor there are our loans plus securitiestodeposit ratio we run a much smaller securities portfolio than most of our peers and our belief is that as much as we can use deposits to help our clients thats where we want to put it first as we move forward we continue to see loantodeposit ratio does tend to change as we have to fund up mortgage warehouse and youll see we did put additional brokered on were comfortable generally with where its at in the near term but of course we want to continue to work it down over time i would say its not the biggest piece of our competitive pricing what were trying to do is defend our home front we want to make sure that clients that are with us are staying with us and so i would say the newtobank absolutely comes in at a higher rate but its really the back book and the current clients that are being made offers by other banks that are out there looking for the same deposit growth that were looking for and to retain them in order to continue to have deposit growth quarteroverquarter does come in a little bit higher of a premium d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee ebrahim ill add we look at our deposit activity and deposit pricing largely through the customer acquisition lens now we dont think about it in a significant way around loantodeposit ratio so while that is important over time we look at growing customer relationships and youll note that we grew customer deposits about during the course of this quarter about billion or so on the customer side and we want to continue to grow in what are very attractive footprints with highquality customer relationships were pricing attractively versus wholesale funds and were pricing attractively to gain market share so while the two are somewhat related we spent more time focusing on how we grow our customer relationships particularly and our retail private client high net worth businesses ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thank you both d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator thank you very much our next question comes from michael rose of raymond james michael your line is now open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions hope i just wanted to dig into your comments on the margin a little bit certainly understand a little bit more pressure in the fourth quarter just given the mismatch of timing that you referenced first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 but as we think about the margin into next year with some of the tailwinds as you mentioned on the deposit side some additional repricing opportunities i think the slide deck mentioned a chunk of deposits that was eligible for repricing billion of promotional client deposits that are eligible for repricing in the fourth quarter are we at a point where the fourth quarter do you think is the inflection point for the nim and we can move higher despite your rate sensitivity or is the expectation that its going to be a push and pull each quarter and we shouldnt expect the margin to really move at least over the next couple quarters thanks hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee michael thank you for the question i would say its probably going to be more of a push and pull quarterto quarter it really depends on how quickly we do the rate cuts we see backtoback rate cuts in november december and then we see some stabilization our margin can stabilize but we continue to see month after month or quarter after quarter repricing down as i mentioned in my comments our loans are going to of our loans are going to reprice down our deposits were going to have to work through that as they come off promotions and newtobank so i dont think it will necessarily be a steady trajectory one way or the other based on the current forward curve in but we are doing everything we can to put things in place to make sure that we can take somewhat asset sensitivity off of the table as we see a very uncertain rate cut environment for example we just shortened our newtobank furloughs that you see a 90day guarantee to days guarantee and that allows us a little bit more flexibility quicker and we are less assetsensitive currently because of that deposit repricing its just maybe the lag quartertoquarter especially depending on how late in a quarter we get the loan repricing ph for at the deposit side d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee one of the key variables michael is as hope said the pacing of rate cuts and as she properly noted the more significant rate cuts are the more impact you will see on net interest income but the more offset youll see in our fixed income business et cetera and thats why we focused on the total revenue where we think were significantly more balanced and less sensitive to interest rate cycles than it might appear if you focus on one line item or the other but we do believe that weve got the balance sheet positioned in such a way that we can manage through interest rate volatility and we will adapt to whatever pace the fomc sets for moving rates in the rest of this year and into michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc certainly understand that maybe just as a followup and i know that rate backdrop is difficult to project and i know its early for next year but is the plan or the expectation that you can grow kind of adjusted ppnr year overyear and are you planning at this point for positive operating leverage and i asked that because i certainly understand you pulled some levers on the cost savings front but were hearing more and more banks looking to hire bankers i assume that would be some of your expectation to drive first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 some balance sheet growth but just wondering just initially if you had any comments on how we should kind of think about that thanks d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah well provide a little more guidance in the remainder of this quarter or outlook for next year but i sit here today i expect that we will drive positive ppnr next year and were still working through the various line items but i do think you will see us growing our ppnr in michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right ill step back thanks for taking my questions d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee all right thank you operator thank you very much our next question comes from jon arfstrom of rbc capital jon your line is now open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc bryan one for you give us your thoughts on loan growth expectations looks like you guys referenced some cre stability but ci was a bit weaker but talk about what youre seeing how much of this is selfimposed and what kind of an outlook you have for growth d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i would say very little of what were seeing is selfimposed were not limiting the size of the balance sheet theres one caveat to that that i will come back to in a second the loan growth in the marketplace is somewhat muted at this point it has not picked up i couldnt tell you well how to weight the parts but i suspect some part of it is what happens in the elections that are coming up in the next month its partly weighted on what the fed is going to do with interest rates and in particular when deals start to look better financially and then just overall are we going to have a soft landing or something else first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 and im somewhat optimistic that we get through the next days well have greater clarity maybe on all three of those and if we do i think theres some pentup loan demand at least we hear that in our customer conversations the marketplace is still somewhat muted and its still very very competitive at this point i mentioned the one exception there are a few places where we have taken some participations where we had been in participations for a period of time we had not broadened or deepened the relationship as we thought we might and weve used the opportunity to exit out of some of that but other than that were looking to grow with our client base were looking to grow and lean in when customers are ready to make investments jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay fair enough on that so maybe a little more optimism potentially i know thats a lot of hedging there but it feels like youre still somewhat optimistic on growth d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee i didnt mean the hedge as much as i meant to convey uncertainty about whats going to happen jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay hope a followup on fixed income are you willing to share what the adrs look like in august and september how big of a stepup that was i think that would help us with maybe your run rate hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee jon i actually dont have that in front of me august and september were generally pretty equal as i recall but the end of september following the rate cuts was a significant uptick and right before the rate indiscernible i would say that months were not materially different but the weeks told a much different story nobody really wanted to buy anything right before the rate cut and after the rate cut we finished the quarter really strong and i think well see that same type of momentum as theres uncertainty about rate cuts in the coming few months d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee jon the 10year the rate curve has moved around a good bit as peoples expectations for the economy have changed i gave you the last two weeks if you look at the first week of october we were a little over million last week we were a little over so two weeks does not make a trend and it moves around based on what interest rates and sentiment in the market are doing on the whole we were a little over i think were at for this quarter and just passed and our outlook is to be slightly better for that than the remainder of the year and you have to keep in mind as you well know that at some point the markets tend to shut down as you get into the back part of the year so were optimistic on activity for the remainder of this year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 yeah okay thats helpful thank you very much d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah operator thank you very much operator instructions our next question comes from jared shaw of barclays capital jared your line is now open jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning everybody d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc and maybe just going back on the deposit side the billion that you referenced thats coming due in fourth quarter could you give us an update on the pricing of those deposits now and where you expect to see that move into and also is there a term change in that promotion hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee jared yeah starting at the end of your question we have changed the term as recently as last week as we continue to look at how to bring down rates it is really a sensitivity analysis of how sensitive our clients to how quickly the rates are falling and so we did just roll out the of last week new rates that as i mentioned earlier only guaranteed for days versus our prior our money market is currently at that compares to last quarter when you asked me on the earnings call our retention offer is now and so weve been walking it back ahead of the rate cut and after and we have quite a few scenarios for how that might walk back depending on the rate cuts we see in  december rate cut is really hard for us to make much headway with deposits and so the november rate cut will have the most meaningful impact on how much we can walk it back jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay okay thanks and then as we look at the deposit composition whats the appetite for additional brokered from here i heard your commentary that you built that up in anticipation of the mortgage business should we expect to see brokered be a bigger part of the overall deposit mix or are we near the top hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee jared our goal is always use client money first and brokered second but lets start with that being our goal the more we can bring and retain client money the less brokered we need brokered for us is always kind of a match first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 funding for mortgage warehouse we saw mortgage warehouse on average of about million last quarter which ill note is against past years typically  comes down and we actually saw it come up with some of the rate cuts and we saw our refi activity actually increased quarteroverquarter so as we think about that its really going to be more about mortgage warehouse and how much we continue to have balances there in the short run but yes our goal is always try to get out of it quarteroverquarter when we can whether we see decreasing mortgage warehouse balances or increasing client money but i am comfortable where its at were well below our peer group the last couple quarters when i compared our growth rate versus theirs jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks and then just finally for me i know youre guiding us more towards total revenue versus nii versus fees but with the expectation how should we think about the dynamic between continued margin pressure but potentially some balance sheet growth are we at a trough for nii here or trying to gauge or what the our ending the year what the exit of nii is for hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee jared for i dont see much of a change from our prior guidance when you look at the new revenue guidance we gave it is in line of both revenue and nii ph just so we come in the low end of one the high end on the other for us not just for  going into next year as we think about nii the big unknown for us is how much mortgage are we going to see its our highest yielding asset and so we did see a large refi boom when it moved from a to historical or or weve been seeing that would help nii significantly so as we talk about countercyclical fhn financial is in the fee income line but the majority of mortgage warehouse and mortgage is in the nii line so that also is as we talk about embedded hedges that we do have an embedded hedge with hopefully loan growth going into of both of those businesses jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay great thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from samuel varga of ubs samuel your line is now open samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning just wanted to switch over to deposits a little bit i wanted to see if you could give some color on any initiatives you might have going on to attract some noninterestbearing deposits whether its through retail or commercial d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 yeah this is bryan were looking to really grow across the entire deposit base we have had very been very active in growing our noninterestbearing deposits theyve been stable which sort of follows along with what we articulated earlier in the year which is you get to a core level as a percentage it drops a little bit but thats because we grew noninterestbearing but were looking to grow customer relationships and growing core checking account noninterestbearing low cost deposits is an important part of that so we have had a number of efforts across our entire franchise to grow those deposits and we will continue to lean in and look to grow client customer relationships on the commercial and the consumer side samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc understood and then hope the of loans that are arms can you give us a sense for what sort of weighted average yield that part of the book currently has and i understand that over the next year theres not much of a reset on any of those but i guess as we think about late and are there sort of bigger chunks that we should be aware of as we model nii hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee i dont have the weighted average of where theyre at currently from the rate but we dont have a large wall of them at any time in the next three years theyve kind of been steadily added to our balance sheet over the last years what ill say though is we expect a lot of them to get prepaid theyre being fixed for five six seven years whatever they have left at a if we really see rates get cut to that is one of the items that i think will that i mentioned earlier that we could see a large amount of refi in the arm space for what we have on our balance sheet today d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee if i remember correctly and i look to natalie because she remember these numbers better than i do but you can use as a proxy i think our consumer loan portfolio yielded in the or so range maybe a little higher in the third quarter and thats largely driven by arm so thats a proxy for that number hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee agreed samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc awesome thank you very much i appreciate it operator thank you very much operator instructions our next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw chris your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 good morning hope maybe a question or bryan on the ppnr being above just i guess a couple questions maybe a comment between is that more of a revenue comment or an expense control given your steps and secondarily does that currently factor in the forward curve right now thanks d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yes so if i break that yes down we can prognosticate about rates that its probably most efficient to always use a forward curve so thats sort of our point of reference and its been in flux and were always focused on growing revenue were always focused on controlling expenses i think we have a number of catalysts that were working to leverage that are really really important in terms of our ability not only of driving ppnr in but creating longterm shareholder value essentially taking our return to a little over on tangible common equity back north of 15plus percent and those initiatives that were focused on are really the logical follow on of the work associated with the merger of equals that didnt get done during the integration period so we see a number of opportunities once we get the systems investments made at a very tactical level to grow revenue to deepen relationships to drive additional loan growth and to control our cost centralizing further centralizing processes things of that nature so ill circle back around to yes we think its going to be across all of the levers that you mentioned christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats really helpful thanks bryan and then maybe on regulation your target of on cet1 youre slightly above it i would expect youre saying youre going to continue with the buyback but just any changes over the medium term that you might be contemplating now that basel has been a little bit watered down and also maybe a comment bryan about where you are on the investment for billion thanks d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah yeah we look at capital and literally our board is involved in any discussions about buyback and authorization we feel like we have sufficient authorization to get us through the fourth quarter we will talk to the board in the early part of about further authorization we dont see any shortterm catalysts to bring the cet1 ratio below what weve said is were looking at the economy and how things play out and i would or get circle back in some ways to what i said earlier that customers have uncertainty about soft landing and interest rates and the election process that clarity they get will also be clarifying to us and the more certain we get about continued strength and improvement in credit performance and things like that the more comfortable we get as we approach a soft landing to bring that ratio down we do think that the cet1 ratio is above where we need it through the cycle so we will look at that probably itll be sometime in the early part of before we really start to reassess it in a meaningful way the second part of that is regulatory hurdles particularly around becoming an lfi on billion we are doing a fair amount of work and then making investments in the near term to prepare for crossing that threshold as we look at it we think weve got a number of years to do that work and we will further those costs in over time and build those capabilities that infrastructure first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 but given the markets that were in given the strong client relationships that we have we do believe that leaning forward and growing the balance sheet is an important part of it and its not a matter of if we hit the billion threshold its really a matter of when and that we are going to build the preparatory infrastructure to get it in place so that it wont be an obstacle to our ability to continue to grow on the other side of that i also think that in the event that you have a more difficult landing building that infrastructure gives us the opportunity to be opportunistic if there are strong deposit base that we have the opportunity to pick up in a more difficult financial set of circumstance today you have more trouble in institutions christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you very much d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee sure thing operator thank you very much our next question comes from timur braziler of wells fargo timur your line is now open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning maybe one for hope just following up on some of your comments relating to mortgage outlook for next year i guess whats the rate environment need to look like for mortgage to get back to some of the type of performance that maybe you were implying on the upside hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee our overall belief is that we have to be at a sub6 mortgage rate how that will play out is a little bit uncertain this last basis point cut barely touched mortgage rates as the forward as the curve became less inverted and actually had a steepened curve for a little while there what i think it will be the telling thing and the thing that we continue to see is new home purchases theyre not refi the firsttime home purchases second homes has been historically low for the last two years so a lot of the data were seeing in the mortgage industry says we have the highest supply weve seen indiscernible buyers will start getting back in so i think its going to be a combination of new purchases when we get under a as well as a refi where people are in their fixed rate part of their arm timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then maybe just on the revenue guide it implies a pretty wide range of outcomes in the fourth quarter im just wondering where the greater variability is is it on the nii side is it on the fee side and then maybe more specifically on fees you called out some of the other fees this quarter as being onetime in nature can you maybe give us a starting run rate for kind of ex some of those onetime fees first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee sure what i would say is start with we did not intend to change our range it really comes down to rounding is we would have had to say like instead of flat it would have been the intent is not at all to change our revenue range for  or for the year theres probably more upside on fee income and more downside on nii if the forward curve plays out we really see basis points of cuts in two successive months nii will be on the lower side and fee income will pick up if we dont see any cuts nii is going to come in better i think fee income would look similar to this quarter its really hard to handicap whether when the current forward curve is basis points but most of the market doesnt believe well get more than basis points timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just the onetimers this quarter for fees was that the full increase in the other line hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee ill say the other items it always bounces around boli is something that it just comes when it comes and you dont know so we often have to comment on boli since we do run a portfolio of that moving quartertoquarter i cant really predict whats going to happen next quarter obviously you can figure out as well that those dividends pay in a quarter arrears and the more that were borrowing the more we get those dividends i dont expect it to be materially up or down if im honest it tends to go about in a million range quartertoquarter timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great and if i can sneak one more question in so the comment on commercial real estate that the funding schedule has kind of stabilized out im just wondering as we do get rate cuts as paydowns start to accelerate is there any way you can quantify maybe what historical paydowns have looked like what they have looked like more recently and what type of headwind that might be to broader loan growth hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee you talk about paydowns on npls d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee no just commercial real estate timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc no no paydowns on commercial real estate hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 okay i thought youre talking about the ones that weve mentioned that were in nonperforming that were still paying thomas hung a chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i think this is thomas hung here i think thats going to be a little hard to predict right now because for us a lot of our commercial real estate is went heavier on the construction side and probably a lot of our peers and so in terms of paydowns itll really come down to the other term financing market how much appetite there is for that term takeout financing thats what will really drive the level of paydown that we see timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator thank you very much our next question comes from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott christopher your line is now open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning i have a followup credit question as it relates to the shared national credit exam this year is there anything that could fall out on that in terms of either inflows of npas or more importantly charge offs as we move into  and  thomas hung a chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah hi this is thomas hung again i dont expect so overall shared national credit its run a little under billion for us overall and if you look at kind of the relative performance of our snc book to our ci book the metrics are all generally about the same in line theres not really a material difference in terms of our classified assets npls or yeartodate net chargeoffs and so my expectation is that snc should continue to perform about the same as the overall book we havent really seen a variance christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you for that and then hope just a quick one for you i know you broke out a lot of information on the other expense numbers this morning is there anything in there for operational losses or customer fraud things of that nature that would stand out hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee theres nothing that stands out no as i said it was a bunch of small items that added up to million we did not significant fraud change quarteroverquarter or any large onetime gains on any sales of property or things like that first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call
