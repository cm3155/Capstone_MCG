morning everyone and thank you for joining our call im pleased with the results we achieved in another solid quarter we continue to demonstrate our ability to produce consistent returns for our shareholders while also providing unparalleled service to our clients as i look back at the last couple of months there has been a significant uptick in the competitive landscape especially promotional deposit officers as banks compete for growth against the backdrop of a higher for longer interest rate environment and a shrinking deposit base ill start on slide where we have shared some of the financial highlights for the quarter we delivered adjusted eps of per share which was a increase from the prior quarter with preprovision net revenue increasing by million adjusted return on tangible common equity improved to driven by the benefit of returning excess capital to shareholders we repurchased million of stock in the second quarter and over million yeartodate ending the quarter with an tangible common equity tier ratio excuse me common equity tier ratio we intend to continue to stack one good quarter on top of the next we accomplished that this quarter through modest improvement to net interest income and traditional banking fees while simultaneously managing the expense base and maintaining strong credit performance i remain incredibly optimistic that first horizon will continue to deliver strong results quarter after quarter while serving our customers and communities just as we have for over the past years first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 we have an attractive footprint a competitive product set and a strong credit culture culture that will allow us to profitably navigate whatever scenarios we encounter over the second half of the year with that ill hand the call over to hope to run through our financial results in more detail hope hope dmuchowski senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you bryan good morning everybody on slide you will find our adjusted financials and key performance metrics for the quarter we generated adjusted earnings per share of up from the prior quarter preprovision net revenue was stable to the prior quarter as net interest income and traditional banking fees offset the moderation in the fixed income business credit performance continues to be within our expectations with net chargeoffs of basis points and a slight increase in acl coverage ratio to we achieved our near term target of cet1 this quarter in part by returning million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases this return of excess capital drove improvement in adjusted return on tangible common equity to on slide you will see that nii increased by million as the margin slightly expanded by basis point from the prior quarter to the loan portfolio continues to be a tailwind to both nii and margin average loans are up from the prior quarter roughly twothirds of that growth is in loans to mortgage companies which is our highest yielding loan portfolio loan yields also continue to improve up basis points from first quarter benefiting from new and renewing floating rate spreads and repricing of fixed rate cash flows funding mix partially offset that benefit from the asset side noninterest bearing balances were down on average but encouragingly those balances have been relatively stable since march deposit costs increased basis points as late cycle mix shift continues within the interest bearing portfolio we dive further into deposits on slide seasonality and continued contraction in the money supply drove a reduction in balances in line with the industrys h8 data despite this we have been successful retaining our clients with a retention versus the prior year we have seen stabilization in noninterest bearing balances for the first time in several quarters which is illustrated with both average and periodend balances totaling billion the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased basis points to during the quarter over billion of balances migrated from lower cost base rate accounts into higher rate retention offers which increased the spot rate to approximately up basis points from the end of first quarter on slide you will see that the period end loans were up billion or from the prior quarter the spring home buying season drove an increase in consumer real estate as we continue to focus on balance sheet production around the medical doctor program seasonality impacted loans to mortgage companies as well but we also benefited from competitive disruption in this industry opening or increasing lines for more than clients cre loans also continue to fundup though the pace of that is expected to slow in the coming quarters as previously mentioned loan yields were up basis points from first quarter due to wider spreads and fixed cash flow repricing spreads on new loans increased basis points yearoveryear we continue to expect fixed rate loan cash flows to provide opportunity over the next year with a roll off yield of approximately on billion of cash flows on slide you can see that the growth in our banking fees helped to offset the anticipated moderation within our fixed income business fee income excluding deferred compensation decreased million from first quarter average daily revenue in our fixed income business stepped down to resulting in a million decrease first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 to fee income the moderation in this quarter was driven by a reduction in the markets rate cut expectation and lower portfolio restructuring activity absent a rate cut we expect the rest of the year to be similar to this quarter mortgage fees increased million due to home buying seasonality service charges card and digital fees are both up million each due to seasonal volume trends that tend to be higher in the second quarter we saw a million increase in brokerage trust and insurance fees as second quarter includes incremental fees for tax filing services within our trust department and our wealth management fees benefited this quarter from a higher market index lastly other noninterest income increased million mostly due to incremental swap fees and a gain from a tax credit investment on slide we show that excluding deferred compensation adjusted expenses increased less than million personnel excluding deferred comp was down million from last quarter mostly due to a reduction in incentives and commissions the million reduction to the incentives was driven by lower fixed income revenue and a step down in retention awards offsetting the personal decrease was a reinvest into outside services which increased million from last quarter related to marketing for the new checking account campaigns and third party services for strategic investments as we have shared before we still expect expenses related to our technology investments to moderately increase over the remainder of the year and we plan to offset those costs by continuing to identify and implement operational efficiencies which will allow us to keep the expense base flat to down in the back half of the year credit continues to perform very well as you can see on slide net chargeoffs decreased by million to million or basis points of average loans nonperforming loans increased million with declines in ci offset by an increase in cre though npls have increased clients are still managing through the higher rate environment with approximately of commercial npls still current on their payments loan loss provision was million this quarter increase in acl coverage slightly to coverage on the cre portfolio increased from in first quarter to largely driven by the office sector overall we are pleased with how our balance sheet has performed in this cycle and continue to believe ph credit yield is very manageable on slide weve revisited our nii outlook at the end of last quarter we guided to the lower end of our previous range however due to mix shift and increased deposit competition that we saw late in the quarter we are updating our expectations for net interest income range to flat to down we are assuming a relatively flat balance sheet in the back half of the year as we continue to remain disciplined on loan pricing and client selection the higher for longer environment in addition to heightened competition from new entrants into our markets has pressured funding mix and deposit costs more than anticipated as i previously mentioned we are pleased to see stability in our noninterest bearing deposits for the first time in several quarters however weve continued to see more mix shift than expected within the interest bearing portfolio during the quarter over billion of balances migrated from lower cost base rate accounts into higher rate retention offers our average base rate account yield approximately basis points while our retention offer is roughly all other guidance remains unchanged and we will continue to seek efficiencies to help offset revenue pressures and improve shareholders return lastly you can see that weve achieved our near term cet1 target of we plan to maintain the cet1 around that level and we can reassess moving towards our longer term target of to as we gain more certainty around the macroeconomic and regulatory environment as you turn to slide ill give my closing thoughts im extremely proud of the work that our company has accomplished in the first half of this year the macro economic outlook for has changed significantly in the last six months while there were previous expectations heading into the year of four or more rate cuts now we first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 are looking at one to two but despite all the changes around us we continue to grow earnings per share quarter after quarter i believe that the experience and knowledge of our bankers our teams and our leaders give first horizon the flexibility to efficiently and effectively navigate any economic cycle as we advance the second half of the year we continue to expect strong performance from our diversified business model we will continue to identify operational efficiencies to counter headwinds in revenue we will also remain diligent on managing our capital our balance sheet and our credit performance in order to deliver attractive returns near term and into the future now ill give it back to bryan d bryan jordan chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you hope i echo hopes sentiments we have demonstrated our ability to execute in changing the economic and competitive environments we now know how to pull the necessary levers in order to operate profitably i have complete confidence in our ability to continue doing so over the back half of and beyond i firmly believe that one of first horizons greatest attributes is our southeastern footprint and our established client base while that attracts some of the greatest competition i remain confident that we have the associates the client relationships and the dedication to maintaining an unparalleled banking franchise in the south as always im grateful for the great work of our associates in serving their customers and their communities in particular our thoughts are with those in houston impacted by hurricane beryl and the thousands that dealt tens of thousands hundreds of thousands that dealt for a long period without power we remain committed to supporting our associates clients and the greater community as they recover carly we can now open it up for questions first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you very much bryan operator instructions first question comes from ebrahim poonawala ebrahim your line is now open ebrahim can we check that your line is not locally muted it appears that we cant connect to ebrahim so well move on to the next question next question comes from jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets jon your line is now open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning can you talk a little bit more about the deposit pricing competition youre seeing you flagged late in the quarter and what are you seeing give us some examples of that and what do you think changes or eases that environment d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah ill start and then hope pick up from there its interesting to see the impact it had on our balance sheet there have been an increasing number of deposit offers that are specials across our footprint we saw from large and medium and small competitors and it had the effect of driving the higher cost in our existing customer base the number of customers who came in with an offer from somebody else at a higher rate and then our need to match or come close to matching that rate picked up over the last month or so of the quarter there was north of probably billion billion of that occurring in the third the back half of the second quarter third month of the quarter if youve looked at deposit costs early in the quarter our aggregate cost of deposits dropped early in the quarter was flattish in may and then really accelerated in the june timeframe and the proximate cause is this competitive environment which in the most narrow sense we had to match the competitive offer to maintain and defend customer relationships hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee jon ill add to what bryan said you asked about the offers we have a very competitive offer from a marketing perspective from kind of a new entrance to the southeast of a ph guarantee through yearend and thats been aggressively marketed walked into most of our branches and many of our employees here have been kind enough to indiscernible houses and so that we saw kind of midquarter as bryan mentioned that competitive environment first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 going into the quarter we expected a rate cut this quarter a highly anticipated rate cut so everyone had pulled back from their promotional rates the rate guarantees that we were seeing was really three months we were at a three month rate guarantee and as the forward curve moved to a really late in  expectation for the first rate cut we saw the offers the marketing the digital marketing from competitors significantly increased the longer term and higher rate in the second half of the quarter jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay if we dont get a cut hope do you expect this kind of pressure to persist and i guess its kind of clean this up talk a little bit about the higher end of the lower end of the nii guide and kind of what gets you to the higher end or the lower end thank you hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee jon i do think that if we dont get a cut in  or this year the further out that cut gets the more competitive this environment stays as the money supply continues to shrink out of the economy i am hopeful that with that first cut well start to see some come back but as i mentioned one of the major rate offers that our clients are bringing in it is a guarantee through yearend so even if we were to see a rate cut in september theres still an offer out there that is valid through december at ph a rate but hopeful that that will start to subside with the first rate cut hopefully a second one not too far behind that as far as the guidance absolutely a rate cut we hope will offset the deposit pressure but we are asset sensitive and so the earlier that we get the cut in the year the more that in year well be able to kind of see the deposit costs come down to match the loan side repricing but the loan of our loan book will reprice in the month and well have to work that deposit costs back therell be a little bit of lag as we walk that deposit pricing back as well as promos that come off three months to six months rate offers d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee jon i think its largely a gut call at this point of what happens i think it really depends on what happens with loan demand how the fed normalizes its balance sheet most importantly and particularly what impact that has on deposits across the industry the deposit market is still very tight and i dont think a cut or two is likely to change that very much in the shortterm i dont think it makes it very much different if rates stay higher but i think its going to be a competitive environment because the fed is going through this normalization process and thats going to keep deposit costs probably on the whole more competitive than we might have felt three months ago two months ago jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thank you very much appreciate it d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 operator thank you so much our next question comes from michael rose of raymond james michael your line is now open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions just if i use the midpoint of the guidance you guys are looking at negative operating leverage this year i know it may be a little too early to kind of count or talk about but do you think positive return to positive operating leverage next year is in the cards and kind of what are the factors rates improvement in fixed income and momentum and fees stuff like that that would kind of get you there i assume a little bit more balance sheet growth as well thanks hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee michael our goal is always to start with the intent as we put together a budget to have positive operating leverage to manage our efficiency ratio yearoveryear and so at this point its really hard to say whats going to happen with the rate cut environment right now the forward curve has two this year and three to four next year we went into this year thinking four to six and we might end up one to two so i expect we will work hard and we will set a budget that has positive operating leverage but i think that theres going to be a lot of uncertainty going through on deposit costs as well as money supply we still have an inverted curve so our countercyclical specifically our capital markets fixed income fees needs to see that curve steepen and that will be a huge help for us we can see that start to flatten out to steepen at the end of next year michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great maybe just as a followup as we do think about hopefully a better growth environment for you youve clearly benefited from some a little bit of momentum in mortgage warehouse just as rates come down a little bit and were back to a normal seasonal market but ci loan utilization is still relatively low youve had some fund ups in multifamily and construction and things like that just bryan can you discuss kind of the demand outlook and what youre hearing from your customers is it going to take a couple of rate cuts to see that utilization move up and see some better loan growth thanks d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah particularly so back up to the first question in a macro sense to the extent that the fed is reducing rates we think on the whole that will help our countercyclical businesses and as hope said philosophically we start with always trying to drive positive operating leverage and we have these countercyclical businesses in particular i think our mortgage businesses will be ph helped as rates set and the yield curve reset and that yield curve starts to normalize particularly if and when it starts to drive refinancing activity which is likely to curve as the shorter incomes down and adjustable arms become more affordable i think as we ended the quarter something like of mortgage warehouse lending activity was actually refinanced the rest was purchase money mortgage that tends to be more balanced over time so to that point i think you can see a significant pick up in mortgage warehouse lending and i think in all likelihood youll see a pickup in mortgage lending as the rate curve begins to normalize broadly speaking loan demand is more tepid than we would have thought at this point in the cycle people are generally cautious about investing i think the twin mountains of change out there what is the fed going to do first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 and whats going to happen in the presidential and congressional elections and what does that mean in terms of economic policy because there is a lot of divergence between where our two presidential candidates are so at the end of the day people are a little more tepid but i think as rates begin to fall i think people will become more optimistic both on a consumer level particularly in the mortgage space as well as in the commercial lending spaces michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks i appreciate that you taking my questions d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee sure thank you operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan steven your line is open d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning steve anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning hi good morning this is anthony elian on for steve just to followup on the question on loan growth from michael so your updated nii outlook assumes a relatively flat balance sheet in the back half of the year do you just talk about the drivers of the slowdown in loan growth you expect following a pretty solid quarter you saw in the second quarter i know you mentioned cre fundups were slowing hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hi anthony this is hope one thing that weve got that you need to look at is the seasonality of mortgage warehouse so about twothirds of the or half the increase a little bit more quarteroverquarter on average is mortgage warehouse which seasonally increases in quarter two and quarter three is during the home buying season and then kind of significantly tails off in  and  as a part of that is just the normal increase we have in loan growth we are reaching the end of or near the end of the large fundups we had in loans we originate in the last two years in the pro cre market were not really seeing a whole lot of originations in cre as we continue so were kind of going to tread water in the back half of the year as we see paydowns cash flows come in with what new lending will be susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee anthony this is susan anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you and then first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee hey anthony let me add a couple of things anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc sure go ahead susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee i do think as we as we go in though into and i know michaels question earlier about is if theres a better growth environment if you get some rate cuts and the outlooks are better i do think some of our specifically ci clients who may have put capital projects on the backburner well move those back to the frontburner and youll see some opportunities with clients who may want to reengage in some lending activity and we stand ready to work with those clients assuming they meet our risk profile anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you and then my followup can you provide more color on the increase in outside services you attribute in the press release this is tied to deposit marketing campaigns and thirdparty services for strategic investments i guess how much of the million increase you saw sequentially is sticky versus onetime in nature thank you hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee marketing is a seasonal spend there at yearend and going into the new year marketing tends not to be very effective especially with checking accounts it just doesnt tend to be a seasonal time where we see a lot of movement between banks and so  and  are typically where we see more effective directtoclient marketing and so i think i wouldnt say sticky as in yearoveryear as there is some seasonality there we did mention in multiple previous calls that our technology investments were a little slower to get started the end of last year and this year than we had originally anticipated so i think of the technology spend kind of hitting its run rate now and the marketing being seasonal throughout the year typical in past years as well if you look back to last years earnings youll see the same type of seasonality increase in marketing in  and towards the end of  anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you anthony operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america ebrahim your line is now open first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you and good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yes maybe first question just around bryan and hope on fixed income i think you said the million seems like a good run rate for the back half from what i can recall just in prior cycles rate cuts it is countercyclical you should see a lot more bond book restructurings at your clients et cetera so i would assume that if the september rate cut outlook firms up and the steepening of the yield curve should push that to pretty strong levels would be my understanding so am i missing something there or are you just being conservative when you talk about the cap markets outlook d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah ill point you to theres a very pretty graph that natalie put in the appendix that sort of shows fed funds and what it does the average daily revenues and your instincts are right to the extent that rates are moving down youre likely to see an impact on average daily revenue being up and what weve talked about there is a more steady environment were not making any broad assumptions about the fed making significant rate cuts basically following the forward curve but on the whole if the fed is more aggressive in moving rates down is likely to be better than weve talked about for our fixed income business ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess the other side of the other countercyclical business around mortgage warehouse if we get fed cuts but mortgage rates remain around is that enough based on what youre hearing from your mortgage warehouse clients to get activity and a pickup in balances or is there a level of rates on the mortgage front that needs to occur to get that business sort of momentum going d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i think youve got to see mortgage rates drop more significantly to see any real pickup in refinance activity i think youll still continue to see a steady flow of purchase activity but i think to see anything meaningful in terms of refinance activity youre going to see rates drop more than that we have had a opportunity to pick up a little bit of share by increasing lines and we think that will help maintain some stability and balances there and were optimistic that thats a business thats going to pick up nicely as the rate environment does normalize and get a normally shaped yield curve ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and one last question if i may indiscernible on deposit pricing sounds a lot more i think circumspect relative to what ive heard from the banks so far this earning season so one i think remind us is first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 there a loan to deposit ratio that youre managing too which is causing first horizon to be a lot more active in bringing in deposits or retaining deposits and yeah and am i over reading it because what were hearing from most banks is some cooling in deposit pricing things repricing lower from three six nine months ago so i just to make sure im not missing anything d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i think its a couple of indiscernible one is we are attentive to our loan to deposit ratio but thats not driving the deposit pricing strategy as much as it is protecting defending existing customer relationships so were thinking about it from a relationship side of things and thats whats driving the activity if you look underneath the covers i quoted some numbers about our existing customer relationships that indiscernible we also had a significant balance of customers where we were able to move the ph rate back its just on the whole because of competitive dynamics in certain sectors we saw a net aggregate inquiry and deposit costs but it was really driven by our desire to defend customer relationship clearly as i said we will pay attention to our loan to deposit ratio but we think we have the flexibility in our balance sheet to support attractively at least for me to say attractively priced wellstructured credit and through any cycles so its not really constraining our ability in the near term not to say that that wont change but in the nearterm we feel like were well positioned to find customer relationships that make sense for our balance sheet hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee ebrahim theres two things ill add to that ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc sure hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee we are a southeast regional bank and i think everyone with the exception of one that releases a national bank but most everybody is coming talking about the southeast being target for growth and so we are competing differently than the national banks when you look at multiple of our competitors and they talk about their growth opportunities theyre talking about the southeast theyre announcing new branches theyre announcing hiring new teams and so i think the southeast allows us to grow more than the average on loans but its also become more competitive on both the loan and deposit side as more banks are trying to increase their footprint or enter here the second on the loan to deposit ratio as mortgage warehouse funds up in  and  we always see that drift up as ive mentioned before we may have to go deeper into brokered or wholesale during that time but being a basis point yielding asset im okay with that match funding and that loan to deposit ratio going up during the two quarters there heightened line increases d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee basis point spread not yield first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee basis point spread good catch bryan ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc all good thanks a lot for taking my questions d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks ebrahim operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw chris your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great good morning hey good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i hope maybe hey bryan hello in terms of the spot margin do you have that as of june im trying to think about exit exit velocity as you go into next year with what youre doing with the deposits hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee we didnt have spot margin but we do have on slide the spot rate for the quarter which was christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc for june okay hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah thats on slide christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great i must have missed that thank you and then bryan on capital youre at the you talked about clarity on regulation and clarity on the economy being the keys to going down to do you think its a possibility that you could you could have that clarity in the back half of the year or is that probably a event to take down the capital ratios d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i still think its a question were not planning on changing our thinking about that in the near term we want to see the path of rates and what the economy is doing and as most everybody were hopeful that the fed creates a soft landing for the economy but were prepared for something different than that and until we see greater clarity we dont plan to reevaluate that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats perfect thank you d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator our next question comes from casey haire of jefferies casey your line is now open casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks good morning everyone d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc i want to follow up on nii any thoughts to using some of the capital towards a bond book restructuring and improving the yield there i know its a small asset for you but just wondering some updated thoughts there d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah this is bryan casey the short answer is probably not and then in our view the restructuring of the bond portfolio really creates a lot of friction and doesnt really create anything other than a difference in the timing of first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 earnings that discount or aoci mark is going to accrete back to earnings or capital over time and so its unlikely that thats something that we evaluate just simply because it creates friction that doesnt create a lot of economic it doesnt create any economic value over time casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay and then just switching to credit quality the npl migration sounds like it was driven by cre i was wondering do you have any color on product or geography and whats driving that thomas hung a deputy chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah hey casey this is tom hung it was predominantly driven by our cre portfolio in particular office what i would point to though is i think the other performance is within the range of our expectations i dont think there was anything that was surprising to us this is really kind of a just driven more by the higher the longer environment wherein as well as macroeconomic environment what i would point to is within our office cre portfolio we continue to believe we have strong client selection and i think thatll certainly prove itself out in the long run just kind of give you some high level information of our office portfolio by square footage at nine storeys or less and so i think that speaks to kind of the profile of our office portfolio in fact we only have eight buildings that are 10plus storeys and so i believe were with the right projects the right borrowers and the right portions of office to have a good longterm outcome d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator thank you so much our next question comes from ben gerlinger of citigroup ben your line is now benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hi good morning good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc i was curious if we could talk a little bit about the share repurchase activity i know that the cet1 the kind of has probably next year outcome or the banks having a pretty good month so far i was kind of curious how you guys think about the math on buyback kind of taking into consideration to that thats a relative valuation but then also a in total the math is a little bit different because the stocks are going up i was just kind of curious and then if you do continue to buy back could we theoretically see another reauthorization this calendar year because indiscernible so i was just kind of curious on your thoughts on overall share repurchase activity first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah the buyback activity we are thoughtful about price and relative value and our expectations of long term values we think that even with the significant improvement in stock prices across the industry over the last few weeks we think were still at a relative discount and opportunistically we will continue to use capital to repurchase shares i dont know how to evaluate as we sit here today about whether we would reauthorize a buyback this year or next thats a board decision we have plenty of capacity under the authorization that we have that expires in january of this coming year and so we will evaluate that as appropriate but we do think maintaining excess capital when we can return it to shareholders through a buyback is probably more appropriate that we put it in the hands of our shareholders and so we will continue to be opportunistic well look at relative valuations and well make decisions later on about whether we need to increase our authorization or not benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats helpful and then hope i know you said expenses in your prepared remarks i think you said flat to down in the second half of this year i was kind of curious theres always levers you can pull up virtually theres a pretty sizable franchise that you guys have but is that pushing anything out into that could be done today im just kind of curious on how you get down relative to flat hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah ben good question we do expect to be flat to down in the second half of the year part of that is in the as weve spoken about before our bond business or fhn financial had a really good  and we had a high revenue quarter and a high expense quarter we expect that to come back down weve had the td retention the first step down in the back half of this year and we think weve hit the stride of our technology investments and so we are looking at operational efficiencies we have in our adjustments a restructuring cost as we continue to look at ways to reduce our cost with a low growth environment how much head count do you need were you previously spending money with third parties that you dont need to anymore the environment has significantly shifted over the last year and were looking at every opportunity we can to be as efficient as we can and make sure that we have the bryan and i had talked about it before were very focused on our efficiency ratio and not letting that grow over time benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thats helpful but theres nothing being push that so im just trying to think about the hill to climb next year its not like youre intentionally kind of making a little bit bigger by managing to that correct hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee correct benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 okay thank you d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator thank you ben operator instructions our next question comes from samuel varga of ubs samuel your line is now open samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc i wanted to just go back to the nii guide for one second you assume a flattish balance sheet and obviously with the loan growth yeartodate youre kind of close to the middle of the guide you said and obviously seasonality and the lmc vertical isnt going to help for the second half of the year so im just trying to ask is there any sort of mix shift assumption within ph that sized balance sheet or should we think that that loans and securities and cash are all sort of staying relatively flat for the second half of the year hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee sam thanks for the question when do you change your guidance you run a whole set of scenarios and to hopefully only change it once in the year and so the answer is the zero the flat to down takes into account all of the things that could happen and increasing deposit cost a flat balance sheet a slightly up slightly down balance sheet and we feel that whatever is going to happen in the back half of the year we will hit the new guidance between flat and down samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc okay understood thank you and then just on the deposit side thinking about late this year probably on the sort of the noninterest bearing front i wanted to get a sense for i guess where would you expect that growth to return from the retail franchise into the commercial franchise and what would have to happen for your commercial clients to actually increase the dollars they hold in those nib accounts hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee i think the answer is both weve gotten frontfooted on a checking account marketing campaign we havent done that in years really since the moe and we saw a lot of success in the second quarter and so we hope that that will continue and well see stabilization in the noninterest bearing and i also mentioned as we look at that theres a small amount of noninterest bearing but also interest bearing when we talk about the commercial first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 clients weve talked a lot about our technology investments one of the biggest investments were making is converting and upgrading our treasury management systems and on the back half of that we expect to convert that complete that conversion in  and some into  we do expect that well be able to attract and retain clients and deepen relationships and attract new clients with our new and improved treasury management system d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i think the opportunities for growth exist on both sides and a fed shrinking its balance sheet world that money is ultimately coming out of customer accounts too and if you look at customer accounts theyve been declining over the last several months and really going back a year or so but we think there are opportunities as hope to grow both on the consumer side weve got a checking offer that is showing very good signs early in the process we think the completion of the treasury integration effort will be very significant in terms of our ability to continue to grow in the market that product so were optimistic on both sides and as weve said a number of times were in a bit of a very attractive footprint its competitive but its a very attractive footprint and we think that gives us plenty of opportunity to invest in some of these higher growth markets where we have in many cases smaller shares and so were optimistic about our ability to invest and grow across this state footprint samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks for all the color i appreciate it hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator our next question comes from christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott christopher your line is now open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning chris christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc susan i had a question for you on the i had a question on the cre reserves and was curious if theres flexibility there now that those rose in the quarter and given that the lease renewals are very limited as you had outlined in the slides first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee so your question is that there is can you repeat the question chris christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc is there flexibility on your reserve can you reserve for cre growth less than we just saw just because youve got limited renewals and sort of address what you needed to this last quarter susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i do believe that especially as rates and rates have continued to while theyve been stable if they come down were going to see i think a good bit of relief on commercial real estate and actually ci indiscernible everybody and so we will see some healing there i also think that weve been very proactive and on the conservative side as we think about grading and weve done that for really the duration and so as weve built some reserves over time i believe were adequately reserved at this time and at this time we dont expect to build and are there opportunities to release as things moderate i absolutely think there could be christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks for that and then just had a question for hope as it pertains to the technology spend i know you mentioned that there was sort of slow on the pace as it accelerates is it going to be treasury management things like youve mentioned or would it be upping other initiatives back towards the core at the bank hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee early on we have a three year plan and early on a lot of it was kind of what were calling run the bank is end of life systems like treasury management and gl things that we had put on pause following the moe integration and following the month dating and courting we had that end up working out now as were framed in that most of that run the bank is getting through we are doing more change the bank more client facing in the back half of our three year investment strategy and next year well be talking about this year were talking about the big two which are gl and treasury management and next year well share with you some of the big what were doing as well christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks very much hope i appreciate the time d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks chris operator operator instructions our next question comes from jared shaw of barclays jared your line is now open first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 jonathan rau q analyst barclays capital inc hi this is jon rau on for jared i guess just if we could get a little more color on the migration into npls and the office portfolio i guess what portion of the increase in npls was from office in particular and has there been any differentiation across geographies just on overall performance within the office portfolio thomas hung a deputy chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee hey jon this is tom hung a large portion of the npl increase is driven by office i think thats probably not surprising but as i mentioned i believe its within the range of expectations that weve had based on what we based on the information we have about kind of the broader environment and the rate environment that were in i would reiterate that i believe weve continue to show good underwriting and client selection and so even as we go into these deals we certainly did always stress test the portfolio for potential rises in interest rates interest rates change and vacancy rates and so on and so i think what youre seeing overall is just obviously as rates have been higher the cushion has been smaller and so weve wanted to make sure were always appropriately if not conservatively grading our portfolio and hence why you see some negative grade migrations susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee hey jon ill add a few things to what tom said this is susan ill say and youre seeing this just in articles that are coming out from others and from just commercial real estate databases some of the geographies that have seen some weakness in the southeast around office would be atlanta raleigh so a couple of areas in our some a little bit in some of the texas cities so but again these are more at this point we still think of these as kind of project by project and not indicative of a kind of an issue necessarily with a specific geography and to reiterate what tom said weve been conservative in commercial real estate underwriting for many many years and so the upfront equity that we require across all types of commercial real estate projects is significant and so even with some drops in appraised values that weve seen as with reappraised properties either because theyve been downgraded or theres a credit event a maturity weve not seen a lot of loss content there but its something we continue to evaluate on a loan by loan basis thomas hung a deputy chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah we do watch it closely and i would just add that in our traditional office portfolio based on the information we currently have were looking at an average stabilized ltv of about on our office book so that still is a pretty significant amount of cushion for any softness hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee jon the other thing ill reiterate is what we said before is we reiterate our chargeoff guidance so npls are up this quarter of them are current on payments and we still stand behind our chargeoff guidance for the full year first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 jonathan rau q analyst barclays capital inc okay great and thats all are really good color and then i guess just on the reserve it sounded like pre reserves expanded mostly due to office just can you put a number on what the office reserve is and what the rest of the cre portfolio reserve is that susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee we dont break it down by property type but there is cre coverage is outlined overall in the materials that weve provided jonathan rau q analyst barclays capital inc okay sounds good thats all for me thanks for all the color hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator we currently have no further questions so ill hand back to bryan jordan the ceo for closing remarks d
