very proud of the resilience of the first horizon team and the continued progress and results that we delivered once again highlighting the benefit of our business model the team remains strongly focused on understanding and anticipating the needs and prospects and clients alike in order to deliver valueadded advice and services across an increasingly competitive landscape our specialty businesses and higher growth markets helped to drive the momentum in the second half of the year and coupled with funding discipline a focus on expenses and improving credit quality resulted in eps of per share in the fourth quarter and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of for the full year adjusted eps was up over driven by the benefit of the iberiabank merger while pressure on shortterm rates continued and the competitive landscape amplified our client focus value proposition with a broader product set continued to provide a point of differentiation and generate better than expected results strong focus on deposit pricing helped drive net interest income up despite a million reduction in net merger accretion and paycheck protection program benefits core nii was up with commercial loan growth up excluding the impact of the ppp portfolio we continue to see momentum in our commercial business and ended the quarter with unfunded commitments up to just over billion our focus on reducing our deposit costs has really paid off in the fourth quarter our interestbearing deposit cost declined basis points and declined basis points from yearend as many of you know we are extraordinarily wellpositioned to benefit in a rising rate environment and a strengthening economy we ended the quarter with our interest rate sensitivity profile of a increase in net interest income to a basis point rate shock across the yield curve as expected we continue to see further moderation of fixed income and mortgage banking fees given both the impact of higher longterm rate and seasonality as well as additional pressure from our recent reduction in nsf od pricing expense control is an area of focus and expenses were down despite a million increase tied to special bonuses we paid to our frontline associates primarily designed to reward associates who have served clients continuously during the pandemic throughout our banking and our call centers our asset quality trends continued to show strong performance highlighted by net chargeoffs of only basis point and a decrease in nonperforming loans the stabilizing economic outlook and overall credit quality improvement drove another robust reserve release with provision credit of million in the quarter our capital levels remained strong with a cet1 ratio of nearly and given the lower growth environment we increased our return of capital to shareholders including the repurchase of million common shares in the quarter in a total of million shares repurchased for the year first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 this drove a yearoveryear decrease of in our share count despite the impact of dividends and buybacks tangible book value per share of was up in the quarter and for the full year we have made substantial progress towards our upcoming systems conversion in february including additional mock conversions further upgrades to online banking platforms and finalizing client communications we believe the planning and focus on investments in technology products and people positions us well to capitalize further on the power of the combined platform into and beyond as of the fourth quarter we have identified approximately million in revenue synergies related to the merger we remain confident in our ability to deliver at least million in net annualized cost savings by the fourth quarter of this year as the world continues to deal with the impact of covid and variants im very optimistic about the continued macroeconomic recovery and the momentum and strength of our combined organization is providing towards our commitment to delivering top quartile returns i am very grateful for the dedication and hard work of our associates as they continue to navigate the various impacts of the pandemic and at the same time deliver value for all of our constituents clients communities and shareholders im also pleased to introduce our new cfo hope

will be instrumental in helping to drive continuous improvement with that let me turn it over to hope to take the call from here welcome hope dmuchowski chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee thank you bryan good morning to you all i am excited to be with you today id like to start off by saying im deeply honored to serve this company and our shareholders as the chief financial officer im grateful to everyone that has encouraged supported and believed in me all along the way i could not have asked for a warmer welcome from the first horizon team im so thankful for the incredible foundation they have provided me and im excited about the future of our company now starting on slide which provides the highlights of the quarter some of which bryan has already covered overall our results reflect a solid quarter with improvement in core net interest income and continued strength in credit quality and capital return as we look toward the upcoming systems conversion in february and our trajectory in the coming year we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the strength of the combined organization particularly given our higher growth footprint and our highly assetsensitive balance sheet in light of accelerating improvements in the economy turning to slide we outlined the notable items in the quarter which reduced our results about million after tax or per share in addition to net merger related notable items of million we recorded a million noncash charge on retirement of the remaining legacy iberiabanks trust preferred securities million of deferred compensation costs resulting from litigation tied to a company that was fully divested more than years ago million tied to derivative valuation adjustments related to prior visa classb share sales this was triggered by the fact triggered by the fact that these have funded additional escrow balances related to their litigation prior to yearend turning to slide we provide highlights on our adjusted financials and key performance metrics for the quarter we generated betterthanexpected ppnr of million as solid improvement in net interest income was driven by lower funding costs higher other interest earning assets and commercial loan growth excluding ppp first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 this helped to mitigate expected declines in fee income driven by the impact of higher longterm rates and seasonality adjusted expenses of million was in line with expectations which included the impact of a special bonus for employees of million the stabilizing economic outlook and continued improvement in asset quality led to provision for credit of million this quarter which was down from the million credit last quarter this reduction drove a decline in earnings per share adjusted rotce was and adjusted rotce before the impact of the provision credit was tangible book value per share came in at about up as gaap net income was largely offset by a impact tied to return of capital and an decline tied to the markto market impact on the securities portfolio turning to slide we are really pleased to report that our fully taxable equivalent nii was up million linked quarter despite a million reduction in net merger accretion and ppp revenue our strong focus on reducing interestbearing deposit costs through disciplined pricing benefited nii in the quarter by over million as a result core nii was up million or reflecting improvements tied to lower funding costs as well as growth in commercial loans and other interestearning assets which more than offset the impact of spread tightening in the quarter during the quarter we continue to put additional excess cash to work with security purchases of an incremental million at a yield of approximately we ended the quarter with excess cash of million and our securities to interestearning assets totaled as the rate environment changes we will continue to reevaluate opportunities to redeploy excess cash and manage our overall asset sensitivity prudently the net interest margin was up basis point linked quarter and stable on a core basis we lowered our interestbearing deposit costs by basis points which helped drive a 4basispoint benefit to the margin from total deposit costs turning to slide as we anticipated headline fee income was down around in the quarter driven by expected declines in fixed income and mortgage banking fixed income fees remained relatively resilient and were down in line with expectations average daily revenue came in at million compared with million last quarter and resulted in a full year average of million service charges and fees were stable despite a modest decrease related to our recent nsf pricing changes which was partially offset by higher volumes mortgage banking and title fees were down million as the impact of lower secondary origination volumes was partially offset by higher gain on sale margins in the quarter we continue to shift more of our production on balance sheet card and digital banking fees were down million driven by a million decrease tied to a revenue sharing adjustment which more than offset the benefit of seasonally higher transaction volumes in the quarter other noninterest income increased million largely reflecting higher sba servicing income in the quarter turning to slide lets review our expense trends adjusted expenses of million was down million in the quarter driven by a million decrease in personnel the decrease was driven by lower incentives and commissions largely tied to reductions in fixed income and mortgage banking fees these results were partially offset by the million impact of a special bonus to our frontline associates which bryan mentioned earlier personnel costs also reflected lower salaries and benefits reflecting merger saves and lower 401k costs which were partially offset by increase in fica taxes from unusually low third quarter levels outside services remain stable the slight increase was primarily from branding initiatives and advertising related to the upcoming conversion our noninterest expense increased million driven by a dda product reward accrual catch up as well as higher travel and entertainment expenses as well as an increase fdic cost first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 on slide and we covered loan and deposit growth our efforts to broaden their reach and market penetration across our footprint helped generate another quarter of underlying momentum in loan growth average ppp loans were down billion in the quarter with forgiveness coming in faster than we originally expected as bryan mentioned annualized loan growth before the impact of ppp loans was driven by linked quarter commercial loan growth of on a periodend basis we generate loan growth before the impact of ppp and loans to mortgage companies this was driven by a increase in other ci we continue to see great traction in our specialty businesses particularly equipment finance assetbased lending franchise finance and correspondence as well as growth in our markets such as florida tennessee and our midatlantic region these results have been muted some by reductions in commercial real estate given high levels of refinancing activity in the capital markets as well as lower balances in the energy portfolio deposits continue to drive our balance sheet growth again this quarter with billion increase in average dda or which continued to further improve the deposit mix i mentioned the success and benefit of driving down our interestbearing deposit costs which were reduced by basis points to basis points in the quarter that also reduced total funding costs by basis points turning to slide ill cover asset quality and reserves credit quality continues to be strong with exceptionally low levels of chargeoffs and nonperforming loans our allowance coverage ratio remains healthy at and excluding loans to mortgage companies and the ppp portfolio we recorded a million provision credit giving the stabilizing economic outlook and overall improvement in credit quality this was the fourth consecutive quarter with a provision credit turning to capital on slide our cet1 ratio of remained strong but decreased modestly linked quarter as bryan mentioned we returned million in capital to common stockholders during the quarter including million or million shares of common stock repurchased turning to the merger integration on slide we continue to make substantial progress across a number of fronts including conducting additional mock conversions rolling out additional upgrades to online banking platform and completing our client communications weve achieved million in annualized run rate savings against our net annualized target of million by the end of this year additionally we continued making solid traction on revenue synergies with million of annualized revenue synergies that are largely tied to commercial loans with additional synergies tied to debt capital markets mortgage and private client wealth we are extremely focused on retaining and growing our client base and leveraging our expanded set of products and services turning to slide and we provide our outlook for fullyear and for the first quarter our expectations reflect a relatively robust economic outlook with rate hikes in march july and december we also incorporate full year unemployment of approximately with real gdp growth of around and a house price index increase of for fullyear we expect nii to be relatively stable with a roughly million reduction in net merger accretion and ppp benefits largely offset by the benefit of higher rates loan growth and reduced funding costs we expect to generate loan growth excluding ppp in the midsingle digit percent range at period end we had a total of billion in ppp loans with remaining fees of approximately million we now expect the vast majority of portfolio to be forgiven by the end of the second quarter we recognize that there has been a fair amount of first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 volatility in the expectation of rates recently so we thought it might be helpful to provide some additional information on our sensitivity first it is important to note that nearly of our interest rate sensitivity is concentrated at the short end of the curve this predominantly reflects the fact that roughly of our loan portfolio is variable rate here i would note that about billion of those loans are subject to floors with about half of those in the money by approximately basis points we estimate that a basis point increase in fed funds is worth approximately million per quarter on an basis points of margin benefit additionally we assume approximately interestbearing deposit betas in our outlook given the high levels of excess liquidity we provided some additional information on our interest rate sensitivity profile in the appendix regarding noninterest income we expect a lowteens percent decline driven by further pressure in fixed income and mortgage banking partially offset by improvement in wealth service charges and card fees we expect non interest expense to remain relatively stable with lower incentives and commissions resulting from fee income and the continued benefit of merger saves which will be offset by the impact of inflationary pressures our full year outlook for net chargeoff is in the basis point to basis point range and while credit quality continues to be strong we expect that is likely we will need to begin building reserves to support loan growth in the second half of finally we expect our full year cet1 ratio to remain in a to range as we focus on organic growth and opportunistic share repurchases for the first quarter we expect nii to be down at the high end of the midsingle digit range given the outlook for reduced net merger accretion and ppp benefit core nii will decline given a million impact tied to day count as well as increased pressure from seasonally lower warehouse balances and continued spread tightening we expect low singledigit percent growth excluding ppp and loans to mortgage companies regarding non interest income while we anticipate relatively resilient results in our fixed income business we expect fee income to be down in the midsingle digit range with additional decreases tied to our previously announced nsf pricing changes and seasonality we expect noninterest expenses to decrease in the low singledigit percent range with seasonally higher salaries and benefits more than offset by lower incentives and commissions as well as other costs our outlook calls for charge offs to be stable to up modestly with continued positive credit great migration and reserve outflows nearterm on capital as with the full year outlook we expect our cet1 ratio to remain in the to range given our recent performance for strong underlying growth dynamics and expanded product set we feel very well positioned to capitalize on our diversified business model to deliver enhanced value for our shareholders finally turning to slide we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities of our diversified business model highly attractive franchise and assetsensitive balance sheet particularly given the improving economic landscape and outlook for higher rates beyond our upcoming systems conversion we are well positioned to capture additional revenue synergies as well as continue to pivot expenses and capital investments to our higher growth opportunities we also remain committed to making prudent investments to support the dynamic digital needs of our clients and associates and drive further efficiencies first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 as we continue to actively work to improve our overall balance sheet profile and prudently manage capital and risk we believe we are wellpositioned to deliver attractive returns nearterm and into the future now i will turn it back to bryan d bryan jordan president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you hope im excited about the results of combined organization this year and then what momentum i see as we look into and beyond we have an attractive franchise we have a very diversified business model and higher growth markets as well as a strong interest rate sensitivity that hope described so i think were very very wellpositioned the merger continues to deliver revenue synergies and the team is highly focused on delivering valueadded advice to clients with improved products and technology all the while supporting our communities im confident that were well on our way to becoming a top performing regional bank and delivering enhanced returns to our shareholders this concludes our prepared remarks juan we can now open it up for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please ebrahim your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you and good morning i guess d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning bryan just around loan growth the midsingle digits guidance two things one if you what are you assuming happened to the mortgage warehouse in yearoveryear how much of a drag is that and secondly in terms of the midsingle digit growth talk to us in terms of upside risks especially once you get the systems conversion done i would think your market should outperform national gdp which should probably lead to much stronger loan growth as things ramp back up so give us a perspective on what could drive upside risk to that loan growth number hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee yeah this is hope id be happy to take that fannie and freddie projected decline of origination volume in  and a decline in full year so we are in line with that on a balance as well as compressing spread first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 however we hope to mitigate the decline by developing customerspecific strategies to increase utilization and using some of our available tools in both pricing and other credit metrics as we move forward in the business susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee this is susan ebrahim ill addon in terms of potential upside to loan growth just looking at the momentum that we had in the second half of third and fourth quarter we saw so periodend loan growth in the number of our core markets was up significantly so the midatlantic north carolina market middle tennessee georgia and really the whole state of florida we saw quarteroverquarter growth in those markets ranging from over to almost and in ci largely ci some cre and some consumer and as mentioned earlier so i think the indiscernible mentioned that when you think about these markets theyre very vibrant and when you look at what happened during the pandemic and those businesses and individuals moving into many of these markets we have seen opportunity to do more with existing clients as well as with new prospects thats the other thing i saw ebrahim as i looked at the new production in the second half of the year third and fourth quarter we saw increased percentage of new to bank clients while also serving existing clients thats a combination of our existing rms and our track record of attracting seasoned rms in many of these growth markets and in the specialty businesses as that were mentioned previously equipment finance has really been one of our main synergy items weve seen good growth in equipment finance franchise finance asset based lending so i do think as you mentioned there could be upside assuming things with the economy continue to improve d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee ebrahim two additional thoughts first on mortgage warehouse lending and so to describe we think there are a number of levers there and while we would broadly acknowledge that refinance activity is likely to drop and overall purchase money activity is going to drop we have done an outstanding job in my view of sort of repositioning the portfolio and gaining additional market share from existing customers so while we could be down a bit i think weve done a good job taking the lows out of that business by repositioning with our customer base and as susan said we see great opportunities in these higher growth markets that we serve both with existing customers and new to bank i was really pleased with all of the great work our bankers did with new to bank customers and as we said in previous calls we like everybody saw a bit of a headwind in commercial real estate as projects went to the permanent markets earlier and they really put pressure originations have been good there and i think i mentioned in my opening comments our commitments were up strongly at year end and i look at that as a spring loading on the balance sheet that will drive growth particularly as it relates to cre where those projects will fund up over time so were pretty optimistic about our ability to do as hope said deliver something in those midsingle digits ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and if i may one more bryan just a big picture when you talk to shareholders i think look back any reasonable timeframe two three four five years the stock has underperformed regional bank peers talk to us in terms of the importance of this year and then as you emerge out of this integration of actually getting the stock first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 to work like what do you think is needed and do you think will be the year that we actually finally see some of these the power of the first horizon franchise actually work for shareholders d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah its a good question and i think an important one we have i think in a number of things that i think will be a catalyst for not only but i think well start to prove out even further in first one of the things thats sort of been an overhang that impacted us hit leading into the transition is our credit performance from the great financial crisis and i think through this cycle our credit team led by susan along with our aligned bankers led by anthony and anthony restel and david popwell proved that weve got very strong credit quality in the balance sheet so i think weve proven that that repositioning of the balance sheet has worked weve also been dealing with a pandemic and integrating too large organizations in that period of time and we feel very strongly that that organization iberiabank first horizon combined truly is better together were seeing great growth opportunities were seeing the benefits of being in of the largest msas in the south having strong share great bankers and the ability to deliver differentiated level of service with a strong balance sheet and while will have a bit of reset simply because some of the ppp earnings and purchase accounting accretion will be offset we think with the rate increases that are likely to occur hope mentioned i think march july and december december largely being a driver of rather than and growth in the balance sheet were very optimistic not only about our repositioning this year and delivering shareholder value but also how it positions us for creating shareholder value in and beyond ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks bryan d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator thank you our next question comes from brett rabatin from hovde group please brett your line is now open brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc good morning everybody d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee good morning brett hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee good morning first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc i wanted to first ask on the fee income guidance for relative to it seems like the guidance implies that the fee income is fairly soft in the first quarter and then kind of builds thereafter and so i want to make sure if that was sort of how you were thinking about fee income and then in terms of would you describe the fixed income business as a primary driver of that decrease and maybe talk about what youre expecting for an average adr for the quarter d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah so fee income is seasonal in our business in two ways one mortgage activity tends to be lower in the first part of the year and the number of business days also in the fixed income business also impacts it as we look at our average daily revenue across the year first quarter included we think it could moderate a little bit from levels but we think fixed income will be continued to be reasonably strong given the amount of excess liquidity that still exists in the system the steepness of the yield curve and so i would expect something that looks more like for the full year something that looks more like what we saw in the fourth quarter but im sure theres seasonality in a number of these businesses and so first quarter can be a little bit softer it will build as we get into the second quarter and beyond in our view and as we get back to the stronger seasons brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay great and then on the expense guide and just the integration and the expense savings this year its my understanding that the bulk of the expense savings comes more in and rather than first quarter with the conversion can you maybe talk about the remaining expense savings from the transaction and the timing of that this year hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee yeah this is hope ill take that we will not have much in  with conversion in february and our associates that are leaving us after conversion leaving in march we expect to see the majority come through in  and  but as i mentioned in my prepared remarks that will be offset by our increasing inflationary environment as well as our annual raises that will go into effect in march that will be muted through the quarters although we will be achieving the expense savings brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc as it relates to that hope does the inflationary pressures that everyone is seeing has that not changed your outlook from an expense perspective meaningfully hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee i guess its about how you define meaningfully we have changed our guidance for from prior we said we thought quarter  and  would decrease in  and now were saying we expect it to be flattish throughout the year so that is a change to a prior guidance first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay fair enough thanks for the color d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator thank you our next question comes from christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott please christopher your line is now open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning just to get a little more granular on the capital markets business bryan and hope do you think that the clients with all their cash and liquidity does that help the business as you get through the first quarter i understand seasonality just mentioned but just that liquidity that was a lot different than what existed the last time that the fed tightened does that help the business as this year plays out d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah we think it does chris the fixed income business is impacted by a bunch of different dynamics but when you have a steepening yield curve like weve seen over the last several weeks and you see that much liquidity on the sidelines we think it will be helped and while thats to be seen im optimistic that we will see continued activity there the first quarter so were on the 20th day of january our average daily revenue thus far in the quarter are right in line with our expectations and we think that as long as that stickiness remains in the curve liquidities in the system we think that that can be a very very good business for us christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay great thank you for that and then just a follow up as it pertains to some of the new bells and whistles that youre going to get for the lending teams once the systems conversion is done is it proper to kind of expect maybe two quarters to pass by before you can kind of judge some of the big progress on new loans im just kind of curious whats the fair expectation there d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee in terms of are you asking about volumes christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc volumes and new business generation just some of those sort of organic indicators as you have the systems conversion behind you d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 yeah i think it will continue to build theres no doubt about that when youre going through an integration youre in an inward focus people are focused on transitioning existing customers reaching out were also like everybody else in the industry dealing with a transition from libor to sofr or something else and i would say in that context im really excited about the momentum we showed ci loan growth for example in the fourth quarter was i think up roughly annualized commitments were up and i think that momentum is building and i think our teams have done a really good job of doing that and as i referred earlier in the framework of our credit risk appetite so im encouraged by that momentum i think that will continue to build as we see further strengthening in the economy as we see sort of the receding of the omicron variant and hopefully lesser impactful waves as we go forward but i think while we get through this integration i think that momentum will build susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee and chris hi this is susan i agree with bryan when we talked earlier about some of the revenue synergies and we talked a couple of quarters about that seeing very strong referrals and youve referred to them as new bells and whistles the new products and new specialty lines so referrals into equipment finance assetbased lending franchise finance and i would say reverse referrals from specialty teams into our markets is building as well and as bankers the other bankers have been successful introducing specialty businesses additional cash management treasury management products we do think that will continue to build among the bankers in all of our markets and specialty business postconversion christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you both for the color appreciate it d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you chris operator thank you the next question comes from michael rose from raymond james please michael your line is now open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions just back to the fixed income business you mentioned that the curve remains steep but what if we do get a couple rate hikes and the curve does flatten out is that i think the guidance that youve given previously for adrs was somewhere in the to in that scenario or any other scenarios could you see downward pressure on that adr guide thanks d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah if you get a much flatter yield curve or you get an inverted yield curve it will be less attractive for that business without a doubt we dont expect that but that is a possibility michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 okay that helpful and then bryan as we think about this coming year obviously theres been a lot of work behind the scenes what are some of your strategic priorities as we move through the year both on the revenue and on the expense side just in broad strokes thanks d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah yeah first and foremost it is working with our customers and our communities to get through this integration theres been a tremendous amount of effort into the planning the testing the retesting and the re retesting and were now doing a lot of communication outbound calling with our customers getting folks logging into microsites and things like that so first and foremost is getting the integration done beyond that it is as susan said taking the broader product set that we have in the organization and continuing to drive synergies across our equipment finance business or our mortgage business mortgage for example is something weve been out of for roughly years in the first horizon business years so thats a new tool in the old legacy first horizon footprint so capitalizing on those things and then thirdly and maybe most importantly beyond the integration is how do we take advantage of the huge growth opportunities that we have in these existing markets where we have a relatively small share the ability to attract bankers and proven ability to attract bankers and to develop a customized gotomarket approach in very attractive markets and so were very very focused on how we take all of those and drive a tremendous amount of organic growth and build that momentum for the next several years michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc great thanks for taking my questions d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee sure thing operator thank you the next question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please steven your line is now open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hey steve hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee good morning first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start so regarding the outlook for expenses to be up midsingle digit ex the incentives right after almost years of cutting expenses nonstop are you guys now running out of wood to chop there because in the past weve seen you offset this d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah i dont think were running out of wood to chop as hope said we will realize a fair amount more of our cost savings this year but by definition in the way were realizing it we still have some cost savings that will fall to the bottom line or accretive in i think weve got a combination or confluence of things one is were not immune to 7pluspercent inflation that others see and we think we can moderate a significant amount of the inflation we think that what were looking at is an environment where our costs will go up some across a number of different areas but that we have opportunities to moderate that over the next couple of years so a big focus for us will be once we get this integration done and i think the way you think about that integration weve frozen a lot of things for a couple of years other than making some systems investments and improvements but from a process thinking about the organization we will continue to look at that in and through our team led by randy bryan and whos been leading the integration and so weve got a number of things that would fall into that category of additional wood to chop so we think there are further cost reduction opportunities we can use to offset some of these headwinds that inflation puts on the business steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee steve ill add to that is just like every other bank out there you have the inflationary pressures who will also be looking at our cost cuts and how we redeploy them to help us build the franchise and investing in technology people and products steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and bryan you mentioned the companies are inward looking right while youre going through an integration particularly the system integration when do you see the company moving more fully back on offense right being more outward looking does that happen in and then its interesting the comment better together compared to other southeast banks how should we think about this new company from a growth perspective d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 yeah so i think to be very very fair to our bankers i think theyve done a great job managing an inward focus and an outward focus and doing a good job keeping both balls in the air we can put down the inward integration focus ball so yeah i think in the second quarter we wont be juggling that one anymore and well be focused exclusively on sort of that outward gotomarket approach i think its hard to say okay relative to south eastern peers how will you do but i firmly believe that given our approach to markets our product set and most importantly our geography and differentiated proposition i think we can be better than most by executing day in day out on really being differentiated for customers sometimes our product people get frustrated when they hear this but i want to say this but we do is unique in the sense that all of our products are commodities i say our moneys no brainer and our loan documents are no easier to read so where we make a difference is our people in the way we deliver for our customers and i think we truly are differentiated there you couple that with great geography i think we can be extraordinarily good in terms of delivering value in the southeast steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for taking my questions d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee no thank you good to talk to you operator thank you the next question comes from jared shaw from wells fargo securities please jared your line is now open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning yeah i guess when looking at the expectation for earning asset growth whats your expectation for funding with a assumed beta on deposits do you think that deposits actually really grow in or are you expecting to utilize a lot of that cash position d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yes jared this is bryan hope may have a slightly different view i think deposits will get drawn down some over the course of the year i think our perception of the marketplace today is excess liquidity is not unique to our balance sheet it is endemic across the shouldnt use endemic in a pandemic it is across the industry so at the end of the day we think that theres sort of a balance between what happens with deposits and what happened with rates but we think beta which is not all that different in the lag that people saw or that we saw coming out of the great financial crisis is likely to be a good place to start our modeling that lag comes out in subsequent years but we think that theres an opportunity for a little bit of deposit rate lag in the nearterm hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee i agree with everything brian said we spent a lot of time on kind of what the right scenario was with the excess liquidity in the system obviously zero beta seems to make sense however as we get to a more normalized post pandemic environment i think the environment coming in a lot more competitive and people our peers may start first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 trying to be on price on a client relationship basis which will require i think the industry to move forward eventually clients will start asking to make some money on their deposits especially where they have multiple relationships with a company so i think its less about the liquidity and more about just the competitive landscape probably driving up deposit pricing this year jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then shifting to the allowance in credit talking about getting closer to the point where you start building allowance from here were still pretty far above the day one level of basis points and then obviously you have the benefit of the acquisition with the double mark there do you think that you actually get to the day one level before building or maybe we dont assume it gets back to day one with the improving economic backdrop hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee so jared we think probably two more quarters of reserve releases based on what we know today and the outlook for the economy we may need to start building reserves in the second half of the year in terms of an outlook for adl probably in the to basis points just a little bit higher than your basis points that you mentioned but roughly there obviously the models are quite complex but hopefully that answered your question indiscernible d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee im sorry jared i was going to say cecl creates some interesting dynamics the day you book a loan under cecl you effectively book at less than a reserve you book it at you basically book the loan growth and set up a reserve and so theres a dynamic in this transition phase here while we think credit quality is likely to continue to get better and likely could drive some further reserve releases headed towards that day one number at the same time loan growth is going to drive some offsetting impact in that just simply because of the way cecl mechanically works jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then finally for me i guess looking at the securities portfolio ive heard you say you purchased the million at yield can you sort of walk us through what caused the decline in yield when you look quarteroverquarter with the average yields going from to with that growth is there a bigger restructuring behind that d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee no there was no restructuring that portfolio kicks off a tremendous amount of cash flow so youre just reinvesting at lower rates jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 but are you reinvesting at a lower rate lower than that that was purchased hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee no no that million weve added in the quarter at about d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thats right yeah susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee and the book yields on the cash flows that we got was around basis points jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so should we expect to see in a stable rate environment or not assuming any rate move should we assume that securities yields grows now from here d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee given the inherent steepness thats crept into the yield curve if that remains you would expect that it would grow over time yes jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i guess im just looking at the growth in average balances but the decline in interest income from that i was just trying to reconcile it with the purchase at yield that susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee so remember that youre looking at declining accretion benefit jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee versus okay yes operator thank you our next question comes from brady gailey from kbw please brady your line is now open brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thank you good morning guys d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc in addition to your asset sensitivity it seems like first horizon has a pretty big lever just because of your average earning assets are in cash your bond book is still only about of average earning assets it feels like you could easily be throwing more cash into the bond book we have seen the long end of the curve increase pretty nicely i know its still pretty low but how do you think about materially increasing the size of the bond book going forward hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee brady this is hope and as im in my seventh week here and ive only been to one call ill tell you we are spending a lot of time talking about this i know weve got a lot of pressure externally on that so we are looking at it especially in a rising rate environment we need to look at how we position our balance sheet to protect against the downside as well as what the right amount of cash as we have i expect that in and we will see cash leave as the competitive landscape increases and were not willing to price up for a nonrelationship deposit so the short way of saying it as the new cfo stay tuned in the next quarter ill have a little bit more information for you on that bryan i dont know if you want to add anything d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee so i think thats right i think the big driver in the nearterm is sort of opportunistic investment because we recognize we have a fair amount of excess cash similar to what we did in the fourth quarter or third fourth quarter and as you pointed out as rates move away from zero now weve got to add more fixed rate assets to protect against the downside and the bond portfolio is the place to do that so my guess is as we look at this balance sheet well have opportunities to put some of that cash to work at higher yielding points and create some incremental earnings sort of to your thesis brady that we have a bit of a lever there and in addition to a floating rate loan portfolio first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and then my second question is really on the buyback if you look last year in first horizon repurchased to of the company which was pretty notable so it feels like growth is going to be better this year i know you kind of prioritized growth over buybacks as you look at capital but how should we think about the buyback i mean the stock is still cheap do you think that first horizon will still be notably active in the buyback this year d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah we do think that the stock is cheap and as you said we do prioritize organic growth over repurchase activity and while we think that the strength of the balance sheet will continue to grow through organic growth and there will be opportunities to deploy it there hope alluded were comfortable in that to cet1 range were at the high end of that range now so i think that provides us the opportunity at the right spot to take advantage of what we think are attractive levels to buy our stock so yeah it will continue to be one of the levers we use from time to time to get excess capital out of the organization and well balance it between organic growth and getting our capital ratios right for the economic environment brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great thanks guys d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator thank you operator instructions we currently have no further questions i will hand over back to bryan for any
