horizon national corp tennessee thank you aarti good morning and thank you for joining our call im pleased with the strong performance we demonstrated throughout including the fourth quarter we ended the year with very good momentum positioning us well for over the past year we showed profitable balance sheet growth including growth in key markets weve delivered significant earnings contribution from our countercyclical businesses improved efficiency and deployed capital effectively we spent much of integrating capital bank into our legacy business in we successfully leveraged the combined platform with an expanded market presence and increased balance sheet capacity we were able to deliver good earnings power and delivered merger synergies our announced transactions with the iberiabank moe and the truist branch acquisitions should further enhance our growth prospects we should also deliver nice earnings accretion in our strategic focus paid off with broadbased loan and deposit growth in key markets our higher return specialty areas were especially strong our diversified loan portfolio was up from to and credit quality trends remained stable we were able to favorably shift our funding mix with customer deposits replacing wholesale funding with a regional bank average deposit growth of first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 our countercyclical business mix helps us to produce solid returns even in a challenging interest rate environment such as our fixed income business benefited from falling interest rates and market volatility fixed income revenue was up from to and average daily revenue was over million in the fourth quarter of our mortgage warehouse lending business was also helped by lower rates and customer expansion and showing growth yearoveryear the momentum we accomplished through balance sheet growth expanded market presence and countercyclical businesses result in the achievement of the financial targets we laid out for in our investor day we now have a strong foundation to build on this momentum and well use our experience with the capital bank merger to successfully execute on our moe with iberiabank we will also have meaningful opportunities with the acquisition of the branches in very attractive markets that will provide additional earnings accretion throughout the next year well remain focused on growing our balance sheet and not getting distracted while we close and integrate these transactions i am pleased with our integration planning todate and am more confident today about our ability to deliver the announced synergies and build a leading regional franchise the current economic environment is relatively steady in our view our markets are still showing solid growth our customers broadly remain relatively optimistic with the economic outlook ill now turn the call over to bj to go through the quarter then ill be back with some closing comments bj william c losch iii chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee great thanks bryan and good morning everybody ill start on slide by reviewing our eps trends we saw quarterbyquarter through the course of which gives a good perspective of how the momentum of the business has accelerated over the last year our key financial objectives this year were primarily twofold first to accelerate the strong loan and deposit growth momentum that we were seeing towards the end of post the capital bank integration and number two leverage the full year impact of merger cost savings and continued expense efficiency efforts coming into we like others expected rising rate environment yet that outlook quickly shifted at the beginning of the year and put significant pressure on our net interest income growth however our business model and our teams adapted as we expected first we did an excellent job of growing loan and deposits with total average loans up and total average deposits up yearoveryear second we maintained strong loan and deposit pricing discipline in particular our ability to continue growing core deposits while lowering our deposit rates paid from basis points in to basis points in helped mitigate the impact of three fed cuts third our countercyclical businesses like fixed income and loans to mortgage companies generated strong earnings growth that more than offset the rate headwinds and lastly we took out almost of our gross expense base through actions designed to both improve our efficiency and allow for needed reinvestment through all this we posted quarterly earnings growth over the year on an adjusted basis that continued to strengthen throughout the year culminating in full year adjusted eps growth of versus first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 as you can see on slide our consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter showed the line item drivers of growth both linked quarter and yearoveryear few highlights i would point out average loans from fourth quarter versus fourth quarter were up yearoveryear despite the challenging rate environment with the multiple fed rate cuts we still grew nii yearoveryear due to strong commercial loan growth and managing deposit costs lower fees were up materially both linked quarter and yearoveryear from both continued increases in bank fees from strong customer growth and excellent performance from the fixed income business youll see on the bottom right notable items are related to the merger costs from the pending iberia deal a charitable contribution that we made to our foundation and our previously announced rebranding launch that occurred in the fourth quarter lets take a deeper look at the broadbased loan growth were seeing on slide and as you can see here the growth in loans which is well ahead of industry growth comes from all parts of our franchise in both our specialty businesses which grew and excluding loans to mortgage companies which had an outstanding year and across our markets we saw healthy growth with particular strength in our highest opportunity markets like middle tennessee south florida and texas encouragingly pipelines into also remained strong and we expect the favorable momentum to continue taking a look at deposit trends on slide you see that our core deposit gathering in the regional bank is strong and as with our loan growth our growth in deposits is also broadbased across both our specialty businesses and our markets and again weve done this while being very disciplined on pricing deposit rates paid declined basis points linkedquarter and are down basis points since the first quarter of turning to slide this brings us to the fixed income business which again as bryan said had an outstanding year weve known that this business had the nimbleness and capability to quickly capture revenue opportunities when the market turns and with the decline in interest rates and the market volatility it was favorably impacted in terms of market activity in our sales and trading across all of our desks and in addition our other product revenue increased with customers continuing to execute rate swaps resulting in higher fees in our derivatives business and during the last few years the management team has repositioned the expense base for improved profit leverage as volume returned which is clearly evident in the results weve seen this year given the general level and direction of rates along with some expectation of continued market volatility we expect the fixed income business to continuing delivering solid results into lets turn to net interest income and margin on slide linkedquarter we saw increases in both nii and nim as strong loan and deposit growth coupled with deposit costs discipline and a rebound in accretion led to a linkedquarter increase in nii and a 5basispoint expansion in the net interest margin in the bottom left we wanted to dimension for you how much of a headwind the change in the interest rate environment was yet how well our teams were able to manage through it through strong customer growth and solid pricing discipline now lets turn to expenses on slide underlying the great growth and revenue performance we saw across our markets and businesses we also continue to actively reposition our expense base for improved efficiency the discipline approach to expense management weve had over the last several years was a major contributor to our earnings power over the last year as well and on an adjusted basis we were able to reduce expenses slightly versus despite a million increase in fixed income expenses that supported its higher revenue we did it by both lowering our core expenses through the achievement of cost saves from the capital bank deal and first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 continuing with further efficiency actions such as branch closures decreases in vendor and discretionary spending the million of expense reductions we reference here equates to about of the gross expense base by continuing our efficiency efforts we were able to make some reinvestment in our customer experience and technology initiatives that will be critical to our future success and by driving significant positive operating leverage we were able to bring down our efficiency ratio substantially about basis points from to on an adjusted basis to finish fourth quarter at we believe expense management is the strength of our company and this track record gives us confidence in our ability to gain the expected further scale and efficiency benefits from the iberia merger turning to asset quality on slide our credit trends remained excellent throughout the year as we maintained our underwriting discipline net chargeoffs in the quarter were at only million with delinquencies and nonperforming loans declining both linkedquarter and yearoveryear as well with provision growth largely due to the strong loan growth again credit quality remains strong and we expect our credit trends to remain stable slide gives you a preview of our expected cecl impact which as you are aware we will adopt in first quarter of we currently estimate that the adoption of cecl will result in an allowance to loans ratio of basis points to basis points well experience an increase in the reserve largely due to longer term consumer loans and establishing a reserve for previously marked and acquired loans other commercial portfolio reserves are expected to remain relatively stable as a reminder well also see an impact on the reserves when we close our iberia transaction and we have repeated these and laid them out at the bottom half of the slide on slide you see a brief update of our iberia merger and branch acquisition activities for both the closing and integration planning remains on track in addition to holding town halls and engaging employees we have already completed several steps in the regulatory application process and commenced integration planning our current expectation is to close and integrate the branch transaction in the second quarter of and to close the iberia merger sometime mid2020 wrapping up on slide again was a transformative year for us our successful execution of the capital bank deal strengthened our franchise improved our efficiency and favorably shifted our funding mix through market and customer expansion we delivered on our financial targets in that we had laid out at our investor day we showed meaningful earnings growth despite a challenging rate environment we showed strong business momentum by generating earnings and balance sheet growth and demonstrating the benefits of our complementary business model our merger of equals with iberiabank and the truist branch acquisition will expand our opportunities in attractive high growth markets enhance our scale and lead us toward top tier profitability were not done momentum continues across our business into thats all i have bryan d bryan jordan chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee thanks bj to repeat bj a little bit weve accomplished a great deal over the past year we delivered on our financial targets that we set out in that investor day we grew our earnings despite the challenging rate environment and successfully executed on the opportunities from the capital bank merger we ended the year with strong momentum and we see that momentum continuing into as we work on the integration of our moe with iberiabank and our branch acquisition from truist first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 thank you to all of our employees for all of their hard work over the past year on behalf of our customers our communities and our shareholders with that sarah well now take questions question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee good morning steve william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee hey steve susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start on the margin maybe for bj how are you thinking about the core nim here like near term as well as as we work through william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so i think what i would say into steve is we would expect net interest margin trends to remain relatively stable through the next couple quarters there usually is a seasonal decline in the first quarter related to seasonality of loans to mortgage companies which is one of our higher yielding businesses day counts and that type of thing so there could be could be a dip because of those factors in the first quarter but generally speaking given the pricing discipline that weve got on the deposit side and the loan side we would try to hold that relatively stable over the next couple quarters steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 okay thats helpful and then i appreciate the cecl disclosure as we think through the day two impact and we look at the to range should we assume that you stay in the middle of that range or is the bias a decline over time as items such as nonstrategic runoff for example william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah i think as you know the cecl impacts really are largely ph unknown theres a significant effect of future views of the economy as we get into the use of cecl and so if were assuming that the future economic environment is relatively the same as how we view it today then i would expect that the to basis points largely stays our nonstrategic portfolio now is well under billion and so not nearly as big of an impact as it used to be so if we continue to have a commercially oriented balance sheet which we expect then i think largely that range will likely hold steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and does the potential capital hit from cecl change your thoughts around buybacks at all william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee not necessarily now of course we cant do any share repurchases with the pending iberia merger right so nothing would be occurring till that closes but not really i think youre moving from one pocket to another in terms of capital in my opinion so all of that well be putting to our stress test which again is the foundation for how we think about deploying excess capital and with that we feel very strong steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then finally im curious if you guys look at the synergies post the iberia deal closing the benefit from the suntrust branches do you guys feel consensus properly captures the earnings power of this new company thanks william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee probably the short answer is no i think the momentum that weve got in our business is going to carry on into bryan talked about it at the beginning as being a major focus of not losing sight of continuing to run the business as we integrate so thats one of our top priorities then if you look at how were performing today how weve taken costs out of our own organization how weve done it in the capital bank deal how much expertise iberia has integrating and doing the same types of things we feel very confident in our ability to put these two companies together well and deliver that profitability profile over time that we expect from the deal d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 steve this is bryan to add to what bj said we dont think about how we influence consensus in the short run our role is to deliver on the commitments that we make and were very optimistic about what we see in both of these transactions and as i said in my opening comments the more planning that we do the more optimistic i am that we will not only deliver but potentially overdeliver on those commitments so we see both of these transactions accreting to earnings and we see both of them delivering significant shareholder value over time we recognize that its our responsibility to manage the business day to day and to execute on what weve said were going to do and thats what were set out to do steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great i appreciate the color thanks for taking my questions d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee sure yeah thank you have a good weekend operator our next question comes from brady gailey with kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning guys d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee good morning brady susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc in your opening comments you guys said that expense management continues to be a strength of the company you took out another million last year in thats above and beyond any sort of deal related cost savings how do you think about that going forward do you think theres still opportunity to reduce the legacy expense base from here or are you to the point where reductions are not going to be as notable d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee brady this is bryan ill start it i think its going to be really really difficult in the next year or two to separate out whats associated with our integration or the merger or merger of equals with iberia but we continue to believe that through this period and beyond that we will continually have to rethink our expense base and think about how we manage expenses too as bj said control costs but also invest in the technology and infrastructure to deliver the products and services that our customers are looking for first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 the short answer to your question is yes i think there are other additional opportunities in the legacy expense base as well as on the iberiabank side that will allow us to deliver our merger synergies and will allow us to fund the investments that we need to make long term so i am optimistic that we will be able to do exactly what you describe and as bj said if you go back years we have consistently worked on our expense base we have consistently delivered greater efficiency and it showed up on our overhead efficiency ratio improvement in and i expect that youll continue to see that improve throughout the merger and integration of the two transactions that weve talked about brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful and then the mortgage warehouse was also very strong in it was up average balances were up yearoveryear and you finished on a high note at billion in a seasonally soft quarter how do you think the mortgage warehouse will trend as we continue through and i know you all talk about the yield being one of your highest or one of your higher loan yields does that yield still run about d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee so brady this is bryan again ill start mortgage warehouse is a seasonal business the first quarter is historically the lowest and i would expect that that could be down million to million on average versus the fourth quarter but as you look at it visàvis a year ago i expect it to be up weve gained market share and we continue to grow our customer base and we continue to broaden the breadth and scope of the business so while it will have seasonal fluctuations or seasonality as weve said in the past we believe its extraordinarily valuable business it creates a tremendous amount of shareholder value by delivering very strong returns and so we live with the seasonal volatility our outlook overall for the business is good we expect longterm rates to be low we expect purchase activity to continue to be very good in refi is a little less than half of the business were seeing today so overall were optimistic about the outlook for mortgage warehouse in susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee a few specifics i would add to what bryan said if you look at where we are just the first days of january compared to the january average last year for mortgage warehouse were more than double where we were last year for january so the pickup in the number of clients weve added net new clients yearoveryear and were looking continuing to do business with goodsized companies medium and largesized mortgage companies and weve been able to increase our average mortgage warehouse relationship from about million to million over the course of the last months so in addition to the economy leading to that great work by the team on bringing in new customers and continuing to deepen relationships with customers that will really help sustain that business even through some seasonal and cyclical fluctuations operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america securities please go ahead first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just one wanted to follow up on the margin bj how should we think about the accretion at least through the first half before you close either of the deals relative to the basis points in the fourth quarter william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so we put on here on slide just a dimension for you the total loan accretion in the year was million that continues to step down every quarter right so accretion by nature would be lower in than it was for the other factor thats going to drive it even lower is the impact of cecl which takes away some not all of the accretion that you have from purchased or acquired loans so loan accretion will continue to come down over the next few quarters ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it okay so a stepdown from the bps in the fourth quarter i guess william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yes yeah yeah because we were if you think about it we should have been averaging something like 10ish a quarter third quarter was abnormally low fourth quarter was abnormally high put the two together and it was right around the million but itll continue to come down a couple of million dollars a quarter ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just going back to the iberia deal and is it safe to assume that i know you said mid2020 but that deal could close by the second quarter or by the end of the given just the timelines weve seen with other deals like tcf last year and bryan would love to get a little more color around just your confidence around the expense savings as you said iberia has done a fantastic job in terms of getting expense savings from its deals historically and you guys have done a great job on expense management if you could just talk to in terms of the possibility that expense savings from the deal could run ahead of schedule and how you think just how the integration plan like do we see a good amount of savings come through by the end of the year or by the first half of next year would love to hear any color that you can provide on this first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah sure so the first part of your question was timeline and we have no reason to believe at this point that we wont get the requisite shareholder and regulatory approvals by second quarter of this year so we expect to close late first half of this year so as far as we know everything there is on track and as bj mentioned we have made the required filings and so the ball is rolling in that regard to your point clearly the experience base with the iberia team has been very very strong theyve done a number of mergers and integrations over the years and so when i step back and think about their experience base and couple with ours i think fundamentally we have the right focus on how we execute on these transactions the thing that has really encouraged me has been the way the eight executives that we announced in the merger announcement as well as the our ability to roll that out further in their organization the way these teams are coming together and planning for this integration is very very good in my view and ive seen a lot of these over the years and there is a strong focus on not only how we deliver on these commitments but how we build the franchise to be in a very strong and stable place for the future delivering strong shareholder value and products and services that our customers wont need for the long term so without trying to fine tune where expenses will fall throughout the back half of this year i would say that i am optimistic that were going to hit our synergy numbers and i think over time we may prove that there is some upside to that so im optimistic in the way the planning has gone to date i love the way that the team is working together to plan the combined organization and as we get through this approval process and shareholder vote im excited about bringing the team together to manage the combined business ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats great to hear thanks for taking my questions d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yes thank you operator our next question comes from tyler stafford with stephens please go ahead tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys nice quarter d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee hey tyler thank you tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 hey just following up on one of the earlier questions about street estimates perhaps not reflecting the earnings power of the combined company obviously theres a lot of moving pieces this year with the branch purchase and iberia acquisition just curious why you guys chose to not provide guidance even on a standalone basis given the momentum coming out of william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah i think generally speaking as you know we dont provide guidance we did i guess you can call our investor day targets a form of guidance that i think was a little bit unique i think if you listen to what bryan and i have said in some of our opening comments you can take some trends away strong business momentum loan pipelines remain strong we maintained pretty good discipline on deposit pricing we talked earlier in the qa on what we thought around margin fixed income given continued market volatility and the level and direction of rates we feel good about the level of what were seeing there and our expense discipline will remain a key focus for us through the first half of the year now again as bryan said and everybody knows its going to get a little noisier as we get to close with the iberia deal and things are going to start to come together but the fundamental business momentum that were seeing continues into the first quarter tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay thanks bj and just thinking about loan growth for i think bryan mentioned perhaps roughly a million stepdown in mortgage warehouse balances but just trying to triangulate what that can mean for growth last year for you had the to growth expectations obviously you came in ahead of that but is that a good range that we should think about on a standalone basis for william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah i think so yeah i think clearly we had really really strong loans to mortgage company growth itd be great if that continue but well assume that thats going to come back in a little bit but the fundamentals of the rest of the growth feel really good such that low to midsingle digit range feels appropriate tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay thanks for that and then just one more for me on expenses backing up the onetime expenses it looks like the employee compensation expense was up call it million or so quarteroverquarter on a core basis even with the ftn expenses up only million or so can you just give us any color on what drove that stepup in employee comp did you guys hire was that incentives kind of catch up for the year or just any color you can share on that increase thanks william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee its a variety of things it was fixed income variable comp driving much of it but then yearend bonus accruals given the strong year that we had as well both on the frontline side related to the volumebased incentives as well as overall corporate results first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee bj you may correct me if i am wrong but it tyler referenced the stepup in ftn expenses last quarter was high because of the legal settlement that was reflected in those numbers and that didnt recur and compensation expense was higher as a result this quarter william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah thats a good point tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc yes thanks for that i think i was taking that into account but regardless yeah that was the ftn was definitely a driver of that stepup so i can appreciate that okay thanks guys thats it for me d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee all right thank you william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee thanks tyler operator our next question comes from jennifer demba with suntrust robinson please go ahead d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee hey jennifer susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee hi jennifer jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hi good morning question on asset quality you indicated you think things will be relatively stable this year your net chargeoffs were so low in just wondering how you kind of think about it going forward and also your franchise lending i know its a small business for you but just wondering how thats performing these days given restaurant pressure thanks susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah jennifer our outlook for asset quality has remained stable and strong at this point based on what were seeing in our portfolio and i know bryan touched on that on the client sentiment as well we continue to be first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 selective and disciplined in terms of both increases to existing clients and bringing on new clients and disciplined around servicing just as a sidebar i would add that i think client selection throughout for a long term sustainable portfolio is so critical and our bankers really do a great job with that i think thats a tribute to the model weve had in market presidents and local credit officers in the market who know those markets and the people that were doing business with because if you do have a situation where you need to come to the table its always great to see clients who step up and do the right thing and thats something that we talk about day in and day out so i feel very good about the asset quality that were seeing and the way in which we brought business on the books the franchise finance team is no different in terms of discipline around underwriting client selection the way that they follow various concepts and look for both opportunities and threats that portfolio is performing well but that is an area and i would tell you even though customer sentiment across the board is very strong the one thing were hearing both from franchise finance clients and really others is the pressure on wages and quality of labor so we do talk a lot with customers about that and you also have many states went to a higher minimum wage that was expected and so these clients have put that in their run rate but it is something that we watch closely jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc great thank you another question just bryan wondering how youre thinking about retention of key iberia revenue producers one of iberias competitors reported yesterday and seemed very excited about a potential merger disruption can you just talk about what your strategy is there thanks d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah absolutely look when youre in merger its even more of a focus but the reality of our business is is that our people are very important to us all the time and so we spend a lot of time thinking about how we really create a culture where people want to be here and serve their customers and were working really really hard with the team at iberia to think about how we bring together these two organizations and it really starts with a fundamental similar culture as the way we do business as the way we view credit as the way we fundamentally think about how we serve our customers and communities and so i dont expect very much of any change on most of our bankers in terms of the way we do business weve also been able to say very clearly to our frontline bankers that given the limited branch overlap that we have that were going to have a role for the folks that are facing our customers in the organization so we dont think were going to create very much disruption but were also thinking about how we use all the tools that are available to us to ensure that people are committed to the organization theyre committed to serving their customers and committed to growing the business so i understand people might express optimism or whatever they may express but were clearly going to work very very hard to keep all of our bankers engaged in serving customers and communities keeping up the great momentum with full knowledge when we put these businesses together theyre going to be in a better place and better product set and services to serve customers and do a better job for their communities operator our next question comes from casey haire with jefferies please go ahead first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning everyone d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee good morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee good morning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc i wanted to touch on the liquidity profile postclose once you guys do close these deals they obviously bring a lot of liquidity the network deposits were up this quarter around billion whats a reasonable level for those network deposits this time next year given all the liquidity because that could be a potential nim defense lever for you guys william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah casey its bj thats a good point particularly the truist branch acquisition gives us probably a net little over net billion of very low cost incremental funding that we can then build a profitable loan and deposit business on and some attractive market so the thought process on the corporate finance case for those branch acquisitions is bringing on net billion of deposits at basis points and letting go the market index deposits and then over time reshaping further the funding mix and so yes that is clearly a benefit that we expect to gain in the second half of the year immediately and then leverage it further what well do is i cant really give you an idea necessarily yet of what we think market index deposits levels will be going forward simply because we want to put the two companies together and see where we need net funding with those types of deposits clearly a gap filler if you will much like how we use it today for excess growth in loans to mortgage companies or movements in our fixed income trading inventory and so the key point though is that the branch acquisition will certainly improve our funding mix and well continue to optimize it with the iberia merger as well casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay and just switching to the nim outlook it sounds like its stable the core nim is stable near term even with mortgage warehouse sort of going against you this quarter you guys did a decent job on the core deposit side pricing this quarter is there still some room to push that lower and offset some of the mortgage warehouse william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah i think so theres a lag effect as you well know when rates when the fed cuts rates libor comes down pretty much immediately it actually leads into a cut whereas deposit pricing takes a little bit of time to flow through and so the margin compression that we saw in the third quarter reflected that dynamic with pressure on first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 loan yields which continued into the fourth quarter but we started to see the benefit of the pricing changes we made on the deposit side coming through in the fourth quarter those deposit rate changes will continue more into the first quarter where we believe the pressure on loan yields will moderate a bit so all in all i think your theory is correct that that will help loans to mortgage company balances and yields coming down will be a headwind but all in all i see our margin being relatively stable a couple basis points here and there to either side of where we ended the fourth quarter based on what i can see today casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks and just last one on capital markets it sounds like the momentum is continuing in the first quarter here i was wondering if you can just give us a flavor as to where adrs are trending yeartodate william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee go ahead william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so i think through the first days of the year i think were between and a day we had million in the fourth quarter which was great and so we expect something around the range of between those levels to be where were at in the first quarter operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc great thank you i just wanted to probe more on tylers question on expenses bj i had been thinking more in the range of million to million or so in terms of core expenses i know theres a lot of moving parts here but is that too optimistic should we really be around closer to million going forward william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee i think its probably not the million range its probably lower than that but probably higher than the million range given how well fixed income has been growing so i would say in the million million range would probably be more appropriate going into the first half of this year d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah it all depends on how you think about fixed income first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah exactly d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay excellent and also the biggest overhang i think right now on expenses is around systems and the integration in terms of is it jack henry is it your internal system is it a thirdparty can you clear the air at all on that topic and if not when do you think youll have a decision made that you can share with investors d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah brock this is bryan i can clear it a little bit its either going to be jack henry or our internal system hogan et cetera i think that decision is brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee relatively close were doing some evaluation and some work to evaluate the various angles and i expect that decision will be made in the next days or thereabout but its going to be one of those two sets of systems were not going to go reinvent the wheel or do something completely different so were going to keep the organization moving and i think that would be a decision that would be solved fairly quickly here brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and you think youre already kind of bracketed with respect to that decision and expense dynamics of that decision or do you think that could result in new guide around expenses d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee i dont think that decision will have any adverse impact on what weve laid out in terms of expense guidance and potentially there may be some value down the road as we think about how all of the systems lies together but we think we put together something in our forecasting or our estimates when we announce the deal that took into account that were going to have to make that decision and we think we put something in place that was very achievable in terms of an estimate so i dont expect any adverse impact or expense estimates as a result of that brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 great thank you d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee youre welcome operator our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee good morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah just i guess looking at the truist deal is that creating any opportunities yet for you in terms of being able to go on the offensive and maybe hiring employees or seeing any opportunities with customers that otherwise were tied up or is it still too early for you to say d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee jared this is bryan its probably a little too early to know the full impact but clearly in the to days that we since weve announced that it had a very positive impact particularly in the midatlantic markets where we already have a presence and theres a tremendous amount of excitement and it does create it basically allows us to do in the midatlantic market call it the triangle and the triad area of north carolina in particular were doing years of work in terms of building branch share and branch franchise so that has a positive impact and we think it will be positive for us in the longterm were excited about the other markets that we get an opportunity to acquire in that branch transaction and so i think longer term it will be a very positive thing for us and im optimistic that youll start to see that momentum building as we close it sometime in the second quarter and the early mid part of second quarter jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thanks and then just on the average daily revenue in the capital markets business is that million million sort of a natural ceiling is it going to be hard to see that ever drift higher than that given the current structure or is that sort of the solid wheelhouse right now given the outlook first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 william c losch iii a chief financial officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah i think like i said a couple of minutes ago i think where were at today is near term what we think the business should be at over the next quarter or two its harder to look beyond that but if you look on whatever slide we had slide for fixed income the bottom right gives you at least a bit of a dimension for how to think about it and how average daily revenues flow in the business right so direction of rates coming down has been helpful market volatility has been helpful but the state of the economy continues to be fairly healthy if you think back to when we had really really big quarters in fixed income like there was a very negative view on the economy and direction of rates and market volatility were favorable to the business as well so all of that to say is i dont think that this is a ceiling now we dont necessarily want the state of the economy to be what it would be to drive average daily revenues higher but we like the countercyclical benefit of having fixed income stronger if there are pressures on the margin which is exactly what we saw in so business is still performing very strong like i said in my opening comments the management team out there has done an incredible job over the last couple of years repositioning the expense base such that when revenue and volume and activity did come back our profit margins got better so as an example three or four years ago the leverage if you will for every or so that we would generate in incremental revenue we would have or so of expense today if you look at the results in the graph its roughly of expense for every of revenue so theyve improved and expanded that profit margin which will only help us on the upside and mitigate things on the downside operator our next question comes from garrett holland with baird please go ahead garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc thanks and good morning i just had a followup on loan growth the ph aca data for ci lending for the industry has softened considerably i was hoping you could elaborate on whats driving your improving pipeline activity following the good performance in susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah we are seeing a strong pipeline this quarter and weve had even our what ill call core commercial so thats our commercial teams that are out in the markets not specialty we had good yearoveryear growth there as you know weve hired additional bankers in some of our what we call our expansion markets or key markets so florida and midatlantic houston continuing to hire bankers as has some of our specialty lines of business so in addition to id say just doing the right thing day in and day out talking with existing customers bringing in new to bank being able to attract new bankers who have a different rolodex and can bring in over time some of the clients that might have been banking at another institution so we feel good about it and as i said earlier not only do i feel good about the type of growth were seeing but the continued discipline around which were looking at these growth opportunities first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc thank you and then maybe a bigger picture question in the past you provided good insight about the heavy lifting involved to integrate capital bank with outbound calls and training hours and the companys performance notably improved as you move past that how do you sustain the core operating momentum as you work through the much larger iberia integration d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah garrett this is bryan it is a reality that as you get into the training around the conversion schedule and start communicating with customers it does impact to some extent momentum the best anecdote to that is one trying to compartmentalize as much of the integration as you can to a small group of people and allow our bankers as susan just referred to our core bankers in the market continue to do what theyre doing which is to take care of customers in their community so were going to try to compress any of that outbound calling and communication to a smaller window as we can we dont have the full integration schedule laid out yet with the capital bank merger we integrated all over one weekend and we did all the systems conversion and its not clear yet how were going to do all of these integrations it could be staged out so our focus as we talk to our bankers and the organization and the same things happening on the iberia side is is look lets stay focused on growing the business lets stay focused on growing customers and community activity and lets let our integration team worry about the integration and so while it will invariably have some small impact were doing what we can to minimize that garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc thats helpful thanks for taking the question d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee youre welcome thank you operator our next question comes from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning bryan and bj i want to just reinforce on the systems conversion few months after the merger to what extent does the fact that your core provider that youre such a large part of their business i think maybe their largest customer does that give you some positives that you can leverage off of and are there any risks that go along with that d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah chris this is bryan our reference evaluation i think thats part of what weve got to evaluate as we look at these systems decisions and clearly if you go one direction youre running systems that are being ph ours first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 for example youre running systems that are running bank of america so theyre infinitely scalable at least from a perspective of a billion banking organization your reference is to the iberiabank systems and part of the testing we have to do is how scalable is it and what does that mean in terms of the ability to grow and invest in the systems over the longterm then thats the work thats going on now were trying to make a systems evaluation that when we get to the end of the integration it leaves us in the best position to serve our customers and community to grow our business and to deliver the lowest landed cost that we can for that systems decision so its a complicated decision but theres an awful lot of good people spend a fair amount of time looking at it and i expect as i said earlier in next days or so well have a decision on it christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay so theres still room for change and evolution on that and i presume that your merger charge kind of long covers cost associated d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah as ive referenced to the question earlier chris i dont think that any systems decision will deliver anything that as we sit here today i dont expect any adverse impact from that i think that the way we felt through it on the front end took an approach where while you might say conservative i would say that its achievable and deliverable so im not expecting anything adverse from that christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great bryan thank you for the background i appreciate it d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee sure thing operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to bryan jordan for any closing remarks d bryan jordan chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee thank you sarah
