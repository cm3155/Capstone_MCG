revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets generally loans leases and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interestearning assets and the effective cost of interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates the following tables present the major components of net

postcovid economy in the us has been marked by strong inflation which began in peaked in and has been abating in the federal reserve implementing a tightening policy in to contain inflation by rapidly increasing shortterm interest rates and ending asset purchases low unemployment rates moderate economic growth and a profoundly inverted yield curve key aspects were although the us economy flirted with recession in it did not officially enter one in recession expectations have moderated significantly the rise in shortterm interest rates by the federal reserve in was both rapid and substantial taking the overnight fed funds rate from in march to a year later hikes since first quarter have been much more modest and less frequent in response to 2022s extremely rapid and vigorous tightening of monetary policy the inflation rate in the us now is well below 2022s levels however inflation remains high in relation to the decade preceding the covid19 pandemic and in relation to the federal reserves stated longterm goal of monetary tightening often creates yield curve inversion for a time in the current cycle traditional inversion when tenyear treasury rates are below twoyear rates has been both very deep and unusually sustained with the current inversion having begun in the summer of yield curve inversion moderated in third quarter as longterm rates started to climb inversion continued into the fourth quarter however key events and circumstances are noted in the following discussions federal reserve and rates the federal reserve raised shortterm rates several times in and in all but one of the raises in were and basis points eachaggressive by historical standardswhile the raises were the moretypical basis points each the federal reserve has expressed its intent to bring inflation under control even at the risk of creating or deepening an economic recession recently the federal reserve has indicated that future decisions to raise rates further or to hold them steady cannot be forecast fhn expects future decisions will be heavily impacted by economic data especially inflationrate and trend data available at each decision point fhn cannot predict exactly when or how much shortterm rates will be further raised when raises will halt entirely how marketdriven longterm rates will behave nor how those actions may affect financial markets during the rest of and early yield curve unusual yield curve effects including inversion are common when monetary policy changes a traditional measure of inversion occurs when the twoyear us treasury rate is higher than the tenyear rate traditional inversion has been sustained for the last half of and all of the first three quarters of an unusually long period the degree of inversion has varied but generally has been much deeper than is typical sustained traditional yield curve inversion is viewed with statistical support as a harbinger of economic recession but recession has not yet occurred the most recent period with deep and longerlasting inversion was over years ago that year period was marked by stagflation low economic growth coupled with high inflation followed by extremely robust interest rate hikes and a strong recession yield curve flattening and inversion generally reduces the profit fhn can make from lending by compressing fhns net interest margin and also generally reduces fhns revenues from bond trading these impacts have occurred and are continuing during the current inversion refer to interest rate yield curve risks located in item risk factors of fhns annual report on form 10k for the year ended december f or a discussion of the risks to fhn associated with flattening and inversion recession the us economy contracted experienced negative growth during the first two quarters of in both cases modestly although two consecutive quarters of contraction often coincides with recession in it did not the economy expanded in each of the most recent four quarters recession expectations in the us were high in and first quarter they moderated significantly after that currently recession expectations generally are mixed and mild with some expecting no recession and others expecting only a moderate one sometime in however prompted by the persistence of abovetarget inflation further rate hikes by the federal reserve could reawaken recession fears and increase the risk of an actual recession banking crisis in march two large regional us banks failed after sudden large deposit outflows and a major swiss bank was acquired by another bank at the behest of regulators in

virtually all us 3q23 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda bank stocks fell quickly and strongly in march with a few falling about following these failures the media published stories about actual and possible bank runs by depositors most us banks saw net outflows of deposits in and early as the impacts of covid19 crisis programs faded and rates available from nonbankaccount investments improved according to federal reserve data starting in midmarch the two failures triggered an abrupt net deposit outflow from all but the largest us banks specifically during the week of march the largest us banks as a group saw net deposit inflows exceeding billion while all other smaller us banks as a group saw net outflows of nearly billion the next week large and small us banks experienced net outflows of roughly and billion respectively the march crisis shock was shortlived however during the final week of march both large and small us banks collectively experienced net inflows of deposits roughly mirroring the first week of march before the crisis emerged the two us bank failures resulted in congressional calls for higher regulation of midsized

widely anticipated volatility in regional bank stocks reappeared in may by june bankstock volatility had abated again but with regional bank prices well below precrisis levels the three failed us banks had a few characteristics that fhn believes were significant negative factors contributing to loss of confidence by depositors in addition to having an unusual customer mix wellabovemedian levels of deposits not covered by fdic insurance significant portions of the pandemic deposit inflows invested in longerterm fixedrate debt securities and very high in relation to regulatory capital market value losses on those investments when rates rose in and early these factors made those banks unusually susceptible to a cascade of negative effects when deposit levels diminished for the entire industry starting in as customers sought better returns in the rising rate environment market volatility valuations as a result of the prospects for recession coupled with the uncertainties associated with war in eastern europe financial markets worldwide were volatile during much of volatility overall have moderated somewhat in but volatile episodes have continued financial asset values broadly fell last year especially during the second and third quarters by midyear broad stock indices largely had recovered from 2022s low points values generally declined during third quarter to the point that many sectors and stocks are in a correction where values are down more than impacts on fhn in fhn benefited significantly from rising rates as the rise in lending rates outpaced the rise in deposit and other funding rates in the first quarter of that outpacing ended with fhns net interest margin compressing slightly from fourth quarter that compression has worsened in second quarter as fhns funding rates especially for deposits rose more than lending rates although net interest margin levels may improve modestly while short term rates remain steady margins are not likely to improve appreciably until the yield curve inversion mentioned above has ended and the curve takes at least a moderately steep slope in and early fhn experienced a normalization of deposit levels since first quarter as it allowed surge deposits resulting from coviddriven stimulus programs to move off its balance sheet net deposit outflows ranged from roughly to billion in each of the last three quarters of and fell again by roughly billion in first quarter that outflow trend ended in second quarter as fhn had net deposit inflows of billion deposits increased again more modestly in third quarter to mitigate net deposit outflows fhn increased deposit rates appreciably particularly in may and june a significant portion of the may and june deposit inflows were in the form of certificates of deposit or cds a large group of those cds will mature in november and december and another group will mature in april and may a challenge for fhn is to retain as many of those deposit dollars and depositor customers as is reasonably practical while moderating rates paid in addition some of fhns businesses have been negatively impacted by rising rates rate increases have pushed home mortgage rates in the us much higher than in early reducing demand fhns direct mortgage lending and lending to mortgage companies saw business decline significantly in moreover fhns revenues from bond trading and related activities fell significantly in due to rising rates coupled with elevated market volatility these impacts have continued in a recession if one occurs likely would have a negative impact on fhns businesses overall demand for loans likely would fall loan losses and provision expense likely would rise many commercial activities that generate fee income likely would decline and competition for clients likely would sharpen fhn already has experienced some of these impacts the deeper or longer a recession lasts the more significant these negative impacts are likely to be for fhn however as mentioned above recessionary expectations have abated in although further interest rate hikes to contain inflation may push the us into recession in such a recession currently is not expected to be severe 3q23 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda fdic special assessment the fdic has proposed a special assessment on banks to replenish the deposit insurance fund in connection with the three large bank failures in march and may discussed in banking crisis above under the proposal the special assessment would be approximately basis points per year imposed on certain deposits over eight quarters starting with the first quarterly assessment period of the special assessment rate could be revised before the proposal is finalized in order to reflect adjustments to the estimated losses to the fund from those bank failures or certain other events fhn expects to recognize an estimate of the entire assessment as an expense in the quarter when the fdic publishes its final action which could be as soon as the fourth quarter of fhn expects that expense to be material to its financial results for the quarter of recognition other regulatory proposals in the board of governors of the federal reserve and other regulators have proposed regulatory changes that would if implemented significantly increase regulatory constraints and costs on all us banks with assets of billion or more a few new requirements would apply to banks like fhn with assets of billion or more but by far the main impacts would fall on billion banks the proposals touch upon many regulatory requirements including debt and equity capital requirements credit risk standards asset riskweighting and resolution planning because of the scope and complexity of the proposals along with the fact that fhn is more than billion below the billion threshold fhn is able to estimate its likely impact on fhn only very crudely assuming the proposal is adopted without change and assuming fhn crosses the billion threshold at some future time after the proposal is fully phased in fhn estimates that the increase in its regulatory compliance costs is likely to be roughly on the order of million per year whatever the actual increase turns out to be it will be significantly higher than it would have been without the proposals the triggering of significant cost increases based on a single threshold financial measure100 billion in assetshas impacted the us banking industry the proposals will aggravate that effect banks near the threshold will be more likely to slow or even halt asset growth at least for a period banks modestly over the threshold in contrast will be more likely to expand their asset base as quickly as possible to make the extra costs more affordable those enhanced effects increase the incentive of banks to consolidate it appears likely that if adopted as proposed significant parts of the proposals will be challenged in court as being inconsistent with legislation enacted by congress several years ago such a challenge would be technical and complex and likely would take many years to resolve moreover even if a challenge of that sort were successful many parts of the proposals likely would remain intact and others likely would be modified but not rescinded greenhouse gas ghg reporting regimes in october the state of california enacted two laws which taken together will require most larger companies doing business in california to report annually their greenhouse gas ghg emissions with an external assurance requirement and to report biennially their climaterelated financial risks and riskmitigation measures the us securities and exchange commission sec has proposed but not yet adopted rules that would require all us companies with publiclytraded securities to report annually their ghg emissions the california laws include multiyear phase in periods and encompass scope scope and scope ghg emissions the sec proposal has scope and reporting requirements along with scope requirements in certain situations the california governor has stated that the new laws are likely to be subjected to technical amendments in the next year or so the sec proposal is not final and could change perhaps substantially when adopted three ghg scopes scope ghg emissions are those from a source the company owns or controls directly such as a manufacturing plant scope emissions are indirect emissions from company activities such as from power consumed by company operations scope and emissions generally can be measured or estimated using information a company normally can obtain without significant external inquiry scope ghg emissions are those from sources and activities that a company neither owns nor controls scope emissions are from a wide range of sources that touch upon a company such as vendors employees commuting business travel etc and customers scope information generally is unknown to a company without significant external inquiry andor estimation 3q23 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda potential business impacts direct compliance costs will include creating systems to measure or estimate and capture relevant data staffing and engagement of vendors including a firm to provide required assurances somewhat analogous to a financial statement auditor potentially of more significance obtaining data to support scope reporting could depending upon how the new regimes are implemented require fhn and other affected banks to obtain ghgrelated information from customers including customers that are not public companies and that do no business in california if so effectively fhn could be required to impose costs andor inconveniences on customers other banks in fhns markets particularly those that are private and not doing business in california could provide financial services without those requirements putting fhn at a competitive disadvantage potential legal challenges the application of the california laws to companies outside of california appears likely to be challenged in court as being an unconstitutionally broad or burdensome regulation of interstate commerce an unconstitutional violation of free speech protections or possibly other grounds such a challenge could take many years to resolve a key practical question will be whether the courts impose a legal stay a moratorium on these laws while challenges are pending assuming the sec adopts final ghg regulations similar to those proposed it appears very likely that legal challenges will be made based mainly on the fact that the sec lacks explicit congressional authorization to create a regulatory reporting regime pertaining to ghg emissions as with the california laws a key question will be whether the courts impose a stay on the rules while challenges are pending assuming the sec adopts final ghg regulations similar to those proposed and further assuming that any legal challenge leaves those rules entirely or largely intact the california laws might be challenged by public companies as having been preempted by the sec rules coastal market growth and rising costs fhns principal markets are in the southern and southeastern united states including most of the major gulf coast markets and several markets on the southern atlantic seacoast many of fhns markets have experienced significant population growth over at least the past twenty years outpacing the growth rate for the us as a whole that population growth generally has been accompanied by economic growth many of fhns fastest growing markets including those in florida can be impacted significantly by hurricanes and other severe coastal weather events as those markets grow fhns economic commitment to them grows as does fhns financial exposure to those events it has been widely reported that the economic costs of hurricane events in the us gulf and southern atlantic coastal areas has been rising significantly over many years fhn believes that rising costs are directly related to growth in those areas for example many parts of new orleans were severely damaged by flooding in as powerful coastal storms impacted the vicinity the oldest parts of town largely avoided flooding while the hardest hit areas on lowerlying ground generally were more recently built as another example on a larger scale much of the growth in florida over the past years has been along the coast moving out from older cities a gulf coast hurricane years ago had a fair chance of making landfall in a relatively unpopulated area now the chances of directly hitting a population center are much higher the average population in those centers is much higher and the average value per building is much higher if growth continues in time every storm will directly impact a population center this significant increase in casualty risks and costs is being reflected in property insurance practices in the past few years the industry has been revising its risk assessments in coastal areas as loss experience has deviated from predictions sometimes badly in florida for example some smaller carriers have failed some larger carriers have left the markets and the remaining carriers have significantly increased the premiums of hurricanerelated insurance narrowed coverage or both coastal states such as florida and louisiana have created lastresort insurance pools for residents who cannot obtain or afford private property insurance however as the costs borne by those pools increase either the premiums will have to rise or general taxation will have to cover the difference in addition those programs generally do not help business clients the availability reliability and cost of adequate property insurance is a significant concern for fhn as well as fhns clients in affected markets instability in property insurance makes fhns business decisions more difficult and increases fhns risks of loan loss and business downturn more fundamentally elevated insurance and casualty costs blunt a key factor driving growth in many of these markets lower costs of living if market growth slows fhns business will be impacted 3q23 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda critical accounting policies and estimates fhn has made no significant changes
