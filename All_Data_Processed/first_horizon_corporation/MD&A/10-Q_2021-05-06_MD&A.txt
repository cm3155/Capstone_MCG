reaction to the covid19 pandemic caused extraordinary disruption to the us economy as well as to the local economies within fhns footprint during the final three quarters of and continuing into the first quarter of business activity especially lending declined throughout and into first quarter this year in certain business lines fhn reduced or stopped new lending because of the pandemic in the fourth quarter of two extremely effective vaccines were approved in the us administration of those vaccines began late in nationwide but on a narrowly targeted basis in the first quarter of vaccine production and distribution increased and a third vaccine was approved in the us public vaccination in the us has accelerated during the first four months of in many of fhns markets covid19 restrictions at least partially were eased by the end of march or during april and fhn believes further easing is likely in the rest of covid19 restrictions still had a substantial impact on fhn and its clients in the first quarter of but fhn expects those impacts to diminish over the rest of this year as the vaccinated percentage of the us population continues to climb within the us economy

on interestearning assets generally loans leases and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interestearning assets and the effective cost of interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates first quarter versus fourth quarter net interest income for first quarter decreased million from fourth quarter this decrease reflected a million decrease in interest income the result of lower average loan balances a decrease in day count and lower shortterm rates partially offsetting the decrease in interest income was a million decrease in interest expense driven by deposit pricing discipline as the rate on deposits decreased basis points from fourth quarter as well as a million decrease in average longterm borrowings the net interest margin was in first quarter down basis points from fourth quarter while the net interest spread of in first quarter was down basis points the decline in net interest margin for the quarter ended march was primarily the result of a basis point decrease in earning asset yields largely driven by an unfavorable mix shift to lower yielding assets average earning assets

partially offset by a billion decrease in average loans and leases from a reduction in new originations continued payoffs and a decrease in loans to mortgage companies partially offset by growth in assetbased lending and commercial real estate the mix shift also contributed to a decline in earning asset yield from the prior quarter first quarter versus first quarter net interes t income increased million in first quarter from million in first quarter the increase was primarily attributable to growth in average earning assets from the ibkc merger and truist branch acquisition in third quarter deposit pricing discipline and ppp lending partially offset by the negative impact of lower interest yields on loans from the decline of libor and prime rates the net interest margin in first quarter was down basis points from in first quarter the net interest spread of in first quarter was down basis points from the first quarter the decline in net interest margin for the quarter ended march was primarily the result of a basis point decrease in earning asset yields as the negative impact of lower shortterm interest rates was partially offset by the benefit of purchase accounting accretion and ppp lending an increase in average excess cash also negatively impacted net interest margin relative to the prior year driven by disciplined deposit pricing the cost of interestbearing liabilities decreased basis points from first quarter average e arning assets increased to billion for first quarter from billion for the same quarter of a billion increase primarily driven by the

annual report on form 10k market risk management valueatrisk and stress testing var is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level fhn employs a model to compute daily var measures for its trading securities inventory fhn computes var using historical simulation with a 1year lookback period at a confidence level and 1day and 10day time horizons additionally fhn computes a stressed var measure the svar computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for our trading securities portfolio first horizon corporation 1q21 form 10q report

as of december  in millions 1day 10day 1day 10day 1day 10day interest rate risk credit spread risk the potential risk of loss reflected by fhns var measures assumes the trading securities inventory is static because fhn financial procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to clients its trading securities inventory turns over regularly additionally fhnf traders actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day accordingly fhns trading securities inventory is highly dynamic rather than static as a result it would be rare for fhnf to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities of the level indicated by its var measurements in addition to being used in fhns daily market risk management process the var and svar measures are also used by fhn in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the market risk capital rules for additional first horizon corporation 1q21 form 10q report information regarding fhns capital adequacy refer to the capital section of this mda fhn also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios key assumed stresses used in those tests are down bps assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve up bps assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve curve flattening assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in shortterm rates and a decrease in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points curve steepening assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in shortterm rates and an increase in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points credit spread widening assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads the difference between yields on treasury securities and nontreasury securities of basis points model validation trading risk management personnel within fhn financial have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by fhn to compute its var measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory among other procedures these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model these model risk management activities are subject to annual review by fhns model validation group an independent assurance group charged with oversight responsibility for fhns model risk management interest rate risk management net interest income simulation analysis the information provided in this section including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis is forwardlooking actual results if the assumed scenarios were to occur could differ because of interest rate movements the ability of management to execute its business plans and other factors including those presented in the forwardlooking statements section of this report management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning earnings or both within fhns interest rate risk liquidity and capital guidelines interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting months of nii under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in nii for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition interest rate movements and loan and deposit pricing in addition assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals the results of these scenarios help fhn develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk while management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable simulation modeling provides only an estimate not a precise calculation of exposure to any given change in interest rates based on a static balance sheet as of march nii expo sures over the next months assuming rate shocks of plus basis points basis points basis points and basis points are estimated to have favorable variances of and respectively compared to base nii a steepening yield curve scenario where longterm rates increase by basis points and shortterm rates are static results in a favorable nii variance o f a flattening yield curve scenario where longterm rates decrease by basis points and shortterm rates are static results in an unfavorable nii variance o f rate shocks of minus basis points and basis points result in unfavorable nii variances of and assuming the absence of negative rates these hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework and do not necessarily represent managements current view of future interest rates or market developments fhns net

trends and potential exposures closely liquidity risk management among other things alco is responsible for liquidity management the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs alco and the board of directors have adopted a liquidity policy of which the objective is to ensure that fhn meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly in a costeffective manner and with the highest degree of reliability the maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide fhn with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs key liquidity ratios asset liquidity levels and the amount available from funding sources are reported to alco on a regular basis fhns liquidity policy establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for fhns risk profile in accordance with the liquidity policy alco manages fhns exposure to liquidity risk through a dynamic real time forecasting methodology base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by alco and are updated as financial conditions dictate in addition to the baseline liquidity reports robust stress testing of assumptions

brokered deposits loan sales syndications and access to the federal reserve bank core deposits are a significant source of funding and have historically been a stable source of liquidity for banks generally core deposits represent funding from a financial institutions customer base which provide inexpensive predictable pricing the ratio of total loans excludi ng loans hfs and restricted real estate loans to core deposits was for march and for december fhn may also use unsecured shortterm borrowings as a source of liquidity federal funds purchased from correspondent bank clients are considered to be substantially more stable than funds purchased in the national broker markets for federal funds due to the long historical and reciprocal nature of banking services provided by fhn to these correspondent banks the remainder of fhns wholesale shortterm borrowings consists of securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions accounted for as secured borrowings with business clients or broker dealer counterparties both fhn and first horizon bank have the ability to generate liquidity by issuing senior or subordinated unsecured debt preferred equity and common equity

total amount available for dividends was million as of april first horizon bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amount of million in first quarter and million in first quarter first horizon bank declared preferred dividends in the first quarter of which were payable in april and declared and paid preferred dividends in each quarter of payment of a dividend to shareholders of fhn is dependent on several factors which are considered by the board these factors include fhns current and prospective capital liquidity and other needs applicable regulatory restrictions and availability of funds to fhn through a dividend from first horizon bank additionally banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings consequently the decision of whether fhn will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results fhn paid a

could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends key among those are changes in the us and global economy and outlook government actions affecting interest rates and the availability and administration of stimulus relief for the economy additional impacts include how the pandemic affects fhns clients as well as political uncertainty potential changes in federal policies and the potential impact to our clients and fhns strategic initiatives the global covid19 pandemic has led to periods of significant volatility in financial commodities including oil and gas and other markets and has adversely affected fhns and its clients ability to conduct normal business and could harm fhns business and future results of operations in march the federal reserve lowered shortterm interest rates twice and started a quantitative easing program intended to lower longerterm interest rates and foster access to credit the effective yields of 10year and 30year us treasury securities achieved record low rates and the us congress enacted relief legislation which among other things was intended to provide emergency credit to businesses at risk for failure from government

basis in the first quarter of vaccine production and distribution increased and a third vaccine was approved in the us public vaccination in the us has accelerated during the first four months of in many of fhns markets covid19 restrictions at least partially were eased by the end of march or during april and fhn believes further easing is likely in the rest of covid19 restrictions still had a substantial impact on fhn and its clients in the first quarter of but fhn expects those impacts to diminish over the rest of this year as the vaccinated percentage of the us population continues to climb within the us economy broadly speaking manufacturing has largely recovered while services continue to lag significantly especially in hospitality and leisure risk of resurgence remains as new virus variants continue to be identified around the world as a result fhn continues to closely monitor the pandemic and its effects on clients especially credit quality on fhns communities and on the
