constitute forwardlooking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual effects may differ possibly materially from what is reflected in those forwardlooking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control including the scope and duration of the pandemic actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers clients third parties and us forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events recent developments related to covid19 overview our business has been and continues to be impacted by the recent and ongoing outbreak of covid19 in march covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization and a national emergency by the president of the united states efforts to limit the spread of covid19 have led to shelterinplace orders the closure of nonessential businesses travel restrictions supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings among other things throughout many parts of the united states and in particular the markets in which we operate as the current pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature there are many uncertainties related to covid19 including among other things its ultimate geographic spread its severity the duration of the outbreak the impact to our customers employees and vendors the impact to the financial services and banking industry and the impact to the economy as a whole as well the effect of actions taken or that may yet be taken by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to mitigate its impact both economic and healthrelated covid19 has negatively affected and is expected to continue to negatively affect our business financial position and operating results in light of the uncertainties and continuing developments discussed herein the ultimate adverse impact of covid19 cannot be reliably estimated at this time but it has been and is expected to continue to be material impact on our operations in the state of texas many jurisdictions have declared health emergencies the resulting closures of nonessential businesses and related economic disruption has impacted our operations as well as the operations of our customers financial services have been identified as a critical infrastructure sector by the department of homeland security accordingly our business remains open to address the issues arising as a result of covid19 and in order to facilitate the continued delivery of essential services while maintaining a high level of safety for our customers as well as our employees we have implemented our business continuity and health emergency response plans among other things significant actions taken under these plans include implemented our communications plans to ensure our employees customers and critical vendors are kept abreast of developments affecting our operations restricted all nonessential travel and large external gatherings and have instituted a mandatory quarantine period for anyone that has traveled to an impacted area temporarily closed all of our financial center lobbies and other corporate facilities to nonemployees except for certain limited cases by appointment only we continue to serve our consumer and business customers through our motorbanks atms internet banking mobile app and telephone customer service capabilities expanded remoteaccess availability so that nearly of our workforce has the capability to work from home or other remote locations all activities are performed in accordance with our compliance and information security policies designed to ensure customer data and other information is properly safeguarded instituted mandatory social distancing policies for those employees not working remotely members of certain operations teams have been split into separate buildings or locations to create redundancy for key functions across the organization notwithstanding the foregoing actions the covid19 outbreak could still greatly affect our routine and essential operations due to staff absenteeism particularly among key personnel further limited access to or closures of our branch facilities and other physical offices operational technical or securityrelated risks arising from a remote workforce and government or regulatory agency orders among other things the business and operations of our third party service providers many of whom perform critical services for our business could also be significantly impacted which in turn could impact us as a result we are currently unable to fully assess or predict the extent of the effects of covid19 on our operations as the ultimate impact will depend on factors that are currently unknown andor beyond our control impact on our financial position and results of operations our financial position and results of operations are particularly susceptible to the ability of our loan customers to meet loan obligations the availability of our workforce the availability of our vendors and the decline in the value of assets held by us while its effects continue to materialize the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the state of texas as well as nationally this decrease in commercial activity may cause our customers including affected businesses and individuals vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us the national public health crisis arising from the covid19 pandemic and public expectations about it combined with certain preexisting factors including but not limited to international trade disputes inflation risks and oil price volatility could further destabilize the financial markets and geographies in which we operate the resulting economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of any economic improvements has impacted the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers borrower loan defaults that adversely affect our earnings correlate with deteriorating economic conditions such as the unemployment rate which in turn are likely to impact our borrowers creditworthiness and our ability to make loans see further information related to the risk exposure of our loan portfolio under the sections captioned loans and allowance for credit losses elsewhere in this discussion in addition the economic pressures and uncertainties arising from the covid19 pandemic may result in specific changes in consumer and business spending and borrowing and saving habits affecting the demand for loans and other products and services we offer consumers affected by covid19 may continue to demonstrate changed behavior even after the crisis is over for example consumers may decrease discretionary spending on a permanent or longterm basis certain industries may take longer to recover particularly those that rely on travel or large gatherings as consumers may be hesitant to return to full social interaction we lend to customers operating in such industries including energy restaurants hotelslodging aviation entertainment retail and commercial real estate among others that have been significantly impacted by covid19 and we are continuing to monitor these customers closely to help mitigate the adverse effects of covid19 loan customers may apply for a deferral of payments or portions thereof for up to days additionally the temporary closures of bank branches could result in consumers becoming more comfortable with technology and devaluing facetoface interaction our business is relationship driven and such changes could necessitate changes to our business practices to accommodate changing consumer behaviors the potential changes in behaviors driven by covid19 also present heightened liquidity risks for example arising from increased demand for our products and services such as unusually high draws on credit facilities or decreased demand for our products and services such as idiosyncratic or broadbased market or other developments that lead to deposit outflows legislative and regulatory developments recent actions taken by the federal government and the federal reserve and other bank regulatory agencies to mitigate the economic effects of covid19 will also have an impact on our financial position and results of operations these actions are further discussed below in an emergency measure aimed at blunting the economic impact of covid19 the federal reserve lowered the target for the federal funds rate to a range of between zero to on march this action by the federal reserve followed a prior reduction of the targeted federal funds rates to a range of to on march our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds as our balance sheet is more asset sensitive our earnings are more adversely affected by decreases in market interest rates as the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly and to a larger degree than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings the decline in interest rates has already led to new alltime low yields across the us treasury maturity curve if the federal reserve decreases the targeted federal funds rates even further in response to the economic effects of covid19 overall interest rates will decline further which will negatively impact our net interest income and further compress our net interest margin alternatively if the covid19 outbreak abates and general economic conditions improve the federal reserve may determine to increase the targeted federal funds rates and overall interest rates will likely rise which may positively impact our net interest income but may negatively impact commercial lending activity and the us economy other actions taken by the federal reserve in an effort to provide monetary stimulus to counteract the economic disruption caused by covid19 include expanded reverse repo operations adding liquidity to the banking system restarted quantitative easing lowered the interest rate on the discount window by to reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent encouraged banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend introduced several new programs that will operate on a temporary basis to help preserve market liquidity the us government has also enacted certain fiscal stimulus measures in several phases to counteract the economic disruption caused by the covid19 the phase legislation the coronavirus preparedness and response supplemental appropriations act was enacted on march and among other things authorized funding for research and development of vaccines and allocated money to state and local governments to aid containment and response measures the phase legislation the families first coronavirus response act was enacted on march and provides for paid sickmedical leave establishes nocost coverage for coronavirus testing expands unemployment benefits expands food assistance and provides additional funding to states for the ongoing economic consequences of the pandemic among other provisions the phase legislation the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act was enacted on march among other provisions the cares act i authorizes the secretary of the treasury to make loans loan guarantees and other investments up to billion for assistance to eligible businesses states and municipalities with limited targeted relief for passenger air carriers cargo air carriers and businesses critical to maintaining national security ii creates a billion loan program called the paycheck protection program the ppp for loans to small businesses for among other things payroll group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage rent and utility payments iii provides certain credits against the personal income tax for eligible individuals and their dependents iv expands eligibility for unemployment insurance and provides eligible recipients with an additional per week on top of the unemployment amount determined by each state and v expands telehealth services in medicare the phase legislation the paycheck protection program and healthcare enhancement act of the ppphe act was enacted on april among other things the ppphe act provided an additional billion of funding for the ppp of which billion is specifically allocated for use by banks and other insured depository institutions that have assets between billion and billion we are continuing to monitor the potential development of socalled phase legislation and further actions taken by the us government the federal reserve has created various additional lending facilities and expanded existing facilities to help provide up to trillion in financing in response to the financial disruptions caused by covid19 the programs include among other things i the paycheck protection program lending facility the ppp facility which is intended to extend loans to banks making ppp loans ii the municipal liquidity facility which is intended to facilitate the purchase of eligible notes from states and certain counties and cities around the country and iii the main street lending program which is intended to facilitate credit flows to businesses affected by the covid19 pandemic with up to employees or up to billion in annual revenues banks and bank holding companies have been particularly impacted by the covid19 pandemic as a result of disruption and volatility in the global capital markets this disruption has impacted our cost of capital and may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets if we need or desire to do so and although the ultimate impact cannot be reliably estimated at this time in light of the uncertainties and ongoing developments noted herein such impacts could be material furthermore bank regulatory agencies have been and are expected to continue to be very proactive in responding to both market and supervisory concerns arising from the covid19 pandemic as well as the potential impact on customers especially borrowers as shown during and following the financial crisis of periods of economic and financial disruption and stress have in the past resulted in increased scrutiny of banking organizations we are closely monitoring the potential for new laws and regulations impacting lending and funding practices as well as capital and liquidity standards such changes could require us to maintain significantly more capital with common equity as a more predominant component or manage the composition of our assets and liabilities to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements furthermore provisions of the cares act allow but do not require the fdic to guarantee deposit obligations of banks in noninterestbearing transaction accounts through december participation in any such guarantee program may result in fees and other assessments as the fdic determines and may include special assessments other provisions of the cares act as well as actions taken by bank regulators such as potential relief for working with borrowers who are distressed as a result of the effects of covid19 could similarly impact aggregate deposit insurance expense application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates we follow accounting and reporting policies that conform in all material respects to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes while we base estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed to be relevant actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management as discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies our policies related to allowances for credit losses changed on january in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in accounting standards codification asc topic asc financial instruments credit losses in the case of loans the allowance for credit losses is a contraasset valuation account calculated in accordance with asc that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses is a liability account calculated in accordance with asc reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of each allowance account represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts while historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfoliospecific risk characteristics environmental conditions or other relevant factors while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our portfolios the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets for additional information regarding critical accounting policies refer to note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements overview a discussion of our results of operations is presented below certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable taxableequivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from taxfree loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a federal tax rate thus making taxexempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields results of operations net income available to common shareholders totaled million or per diluted common share for the three months ended march compared to million or per diluted common share for the three months ended march selected data for the comparable periods was as follows three months ended march taxableequivalent net interest income taxableequivalent adjustment net interest income credit loss expense net interest income after credit loss expense noninterest income noninterest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income preferred stock dividends redemption of preferred stock net income available to common shareholders earnings per common share basic earnings per common share diluted dividends per common share return on average assets return on average common equity average shareholders equity to average assets net income available to common shareholders decreased million or for the three months ended march compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily the result of a million increase in credit loss expense a million increase in noninterest expense and a million decrease in net interest income partly offset by a million increase in noninterest income and a million decrease in income tax expense the increase in credit loss expense resulted from both our adoption of a new credit loss accounting standard and the adverse events impacting our loan portfolio including those arising from the covid19 pandemic and the significant decline in oil prices the increase in noninterest income was primarily related to a million net gain on securities transactions net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended march was also impacted by the reclassification of million of issuance costs associated with our preferred stock to retained earnings upon redemption of the preferred stock in the first quarter details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets net interest income is our largest source of revenue representing of total revenue during the first three months of excluding the revenue associated with the million net gain on securities transactions realized during the quarter net interest income would have represented of total revenue net interest margin is the ratio of taxableequivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin the federal reserve influences the general market rates of interest including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate the prime rate began at and decreased basis points during the third quarter of basis points in each of august and september and basis points in october to end the year at during the prime rate decreased basis points in march to end the first quarter at our loan portfolio is also impacted by changes in the london interbank offered rate libor at march the onemonth and threemonth us dollar libor interest rates were and respectively while at march the onemonth and threemonth us dollar libor interest rates were and respectively the target range for the federal funds rate which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds began at to and decreased basis points during the third quarter of basis points in each of august and september and basis points in october to end the year at to during the target range for the federal funds rate decreased basis points in march to end the first quarter at zero to as noted in the section captioned recent developments related to covid19 elsewhere in this discussion the decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate in march was largely an emergency measure by the federal reserve aimed at blunting the economic impact of covid19 we are primarily funded by core deposits with noninterestbearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds this lowercost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment though federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits were repealed in we have not experienced any significant additional interest costs as a result see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report for information about our sensitivity to interest rates further analysis of the components of our net interest margin is presented below the following table presents the changes in taxableequivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities the changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each the comparison between the quarters includes an additional change factor that shows the effect of the difference in the number of days in each period for assets and liabilities that accrue interest based upon the actual number of days in the period as further discussed below three months ended march vs march increase decrease due to change in rate volume number of days total interestbearing deposits federal funds sold and resell agreements securities taxable taxexempt loans net of unearned discounts total earning assets savings and interest checking money market deposit accounts time accounts public funds federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures subordinated notes payable and other notes total interestbearing liabilities net change taxableequivalent net interest income for the three months ended march decreased million or compared to the same period in taxableequivalent net interest income for the first quarter of included days compared to days for the first quarter of as a result of the leap year the additional day added approximately million to taxableequivalent net interest income during the first quarter of excluding the impact of the additional day during the first quarter of results in an effective decrease in taxableequivalent net interest income of approximately million during the first quarter of the taxableequivalent net interest margin decreased basis points from during the three months ended march to during the three months ended march the decreases in taxableequivalent net interest income and taxableequivalent net interest margin were primarily related to decreases in the average yields on loans interestbearing deposits and federal funds sold and resell agreements combined with decreases in the average volumes of taxexempt and taxable securities based on amortized cost and an increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities the impact of these items was partly offset by decreases in the average cost of interestbearing deposits and other borrowed funds increases in the average volumes of loans and interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve and increases in the average yields on taxable and taxexempt securities the average volume of interestearning assets for the three months ended march increased billion compared to the same period in the increase in the average volume of interestearning assets for the three months ended march included an million increase in average interestbearing deposits federal funds sold and resell agreements a million increase in average loans and a million increase in average taxexempt securities partly offset by a million decrease in average taxable securities the average taxableequivalent yield on interestearning assets decreased basis points from during the three months ended march to during the three months ended march the average taxableequivalent yield on interestearning assets was primarily impacted by the aforementioned changes in market interest rates and changes in the volume and relative mix of interestearning assets the average taxableequivalent yield on loans decreased basis points from during the three months ended march to during the three months ended march the average taxableequivalent yield on loans was negatively impacted by lower average market interest rates during the three months ended march compared to the same period in the average volume of loans for the three months ended march increased million or compared to the same period in loans made up approximately of average interestearning assets during the three months ended march compared to during the same period in the average taxableequivalent yield on securities was during the three months ended march increasing basis points compared to the during the same period in the average taxableequivalent yield on securities during the three months ended march compared to the same period in was positively impacted by increases in the average yields on both taxable and taxexempt securities as a result of investments in higheryielding longerduration securities while the relative proportions of taxable and taxexempt securities to total securities did not significantly change the average yield on taxable securities increased basis points from during the three months ended march to during the three months ended march this increase resulted as the proceeds from the maturity of a significant volume of us treasury securities during the second half of were reinvested in higheryielding residential mortgagebacked securities the average taxableequivalent yield on taxexempt securities increased basis points from during the three months ended march to during the three months ended march tax exempt securities made up approximately of total average securities during the three months ended march compared to during the same period in the average volume of total securities based on carrying amount during the three months ended march increased million or compared to the same period in securities made up approximately of average interestearning assets during the three months ended march compared to during the same period in average interestbearing deposits federal funds sold and resell agreements for the three months ended march increased million or compared to the same period in interestbearing deposits federal funds sold and resell agreements made up approximately of average interestearning assets during the three months ended march compared to during the three months ended march the increase in the average volume of interestbearing deposits federal funds sold and resell agreements was primarily due to an increase in the average volume of amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve during the first three months of compared to the same period in primarily due to an increase in the average volume of deposits and the proceeds from the sale of securities the combined average yield on interestbearing deposits federal funds sold and resell agreements was during the three months ended march compared to during the same period in the average yield on interestbearing deposits federal funds sold and resell agreements was negatively impacted by lower average market interest rates for the three months ended march compared to the same period in the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was during the three months ended march decreasing basis points from during the same period in average deposits increased billion or during the three months ended march compared to the same period in and included a million increase in average interestbearing deposits and a million increase in average noninterest bearing deposits the ratio of average interestbearing deposits to total average deposits was during the three months ended march compared to during the same period in the average cost of deposits is primarily impacted by changes in market interest rates as well as changes in the volume and relative mix of interestbearing deposits the average cost of interestbearing deposits and total deposits was and respectively during the three months ended march compared to and respectively during the three months ended march the average cost of deposits during the first quarter of was impacted by decreases in the interest rates we pay on most of our interestbearing deposit products as a result of the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates our net interest spread which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was during the three months ended march compared to during same period in the net interest spread as well as the net interest margin will be impacted by future changes in shortterm and longterm interest rate levels as well as the impact from the competitive environment a discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this report our hedging policies permit the use of various derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps swaptions caps and floors to manage exposure to changes in interest rates details of our derivatives and hedging activities are set forth in note derivative financial instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report information regarding the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our derivative financial instruments is set forth in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this report as discussed in the section captioned loans elsewhere in this discussion in april we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the ppp administered by the us small business administration sba under the provisions of the cares act through april we have funded approximately billion of sbaapproved ppp loans to over customers we expect to recognize approximately million in ppp loan related processing fees as a yield adjustment over the terms of these loans in april we borrowed million from the fhlb under the covid19 relief program to provide supplemental funding for ppp loan originations the shortterm fullrecourse advance has a term of six months and bears interest at an annualized rate of we are currently considering participation in the federal reserves ppp facility as further discussed in the sections captioned loans and capital and liquidity elsewhere in this discussion we currently expect our net interest income and net interest margin to decline in the latter part of as a result of the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates and the expectation that interest rates will remain at such levels for some period of time the near term impact of the decrease in market interest rates is partly mitigated as certain variablerate loans adjust on a delayed basis additionally our participation in the ppp as further discussed below is expected to positively impact net interest income and net interest margin credit loss expense credit loss expense is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans securities and offbalancesheet credit exposures after net chargeoffs have been deducted to bring the allowances to a level which in managements best estimate is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments credit loss expense totaled million for the three months ended march of which million related to loans and million related to offbalancesheet credit exposures credit loss expense totaled million for the three months ended march all of which related to loans and which was calculated under the prior incurred loss accounting methodology see the section captioned allowance for credit losses elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and offbalancesheet commitments noninterest income the components of noninterest income were as follows three months ended march trust and investment management fees service charges on deposit accounts insurance commissions and fees interchange and debit card transaction fees other charges commissions and fees net gain loss on securities transactions other total total noninterest income for the three months ended march increased million or compared to the same period in excluding million net gain on securities transaction during the three months ended march total noninterest income increased million or changes in the various components of noninterest income are discussed in more detail below trust and investment management fees trust and investment management fees for the three months ended march increased million or compared to the same period in investment fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees making up approximately and of total trust and investment management fees for the first three months of and respectively the increase in trust and investment management fees was primarily the result of increases in estate fees up million trust investment fees up thousand real estate fees up thousand and oil and gas fees up thousand investment and other custodial account fees are generally based on the market value of assets within a trust account the increase in estate fees and real estate fees were primarily related to an increase in transaction volume the increase in trust investment fees was primarily related to an increase in the number of accounts partly offset by the impact of a decrease in average equity valuations volatility in the equity and bond markets impacts the market value of trust assets and the related investment fees investor concerns related to the uncertain economic outlook arising from the covid19 pandemic have caused significant market volatility resulting in significant declines in market valuations particularly among equity securities during the latter part of the first quarter of we currently expect this volatility and the decline in market valuations will adversely affect trust and investment management fee income in future periods furthermore ongoing uncertainty related to the economic effects of covid19 is currently expected to impact the demand and overall transaction volume for our other trust services and further adversely affect our revenues at march trust assets including both managed assets and custody assets were primarily composed of equity securities of assets fixed income securities of assets and cash equivalents of assets the estimated fair value of these assets was billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at march compared to billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at december and billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at march service charges on deposit accounts service charges on deposit accounts for the three months ended march increased million or compared to the same period in the increase was primarily related to an increase in commercial service charges up million and increases in overdraftinsufficient funds charges on consumer and commercial accounts up thousand and thousand respectively the increase in commercial service charges was impacted by a lower earnings credit rate the earnings credit rate is the value given to deposits maintained by treasury management customers earnings credits applied to customer deposit balances offset service fees that would otherwise be charged because average market interest rates in were lower compared to deposit balances have become less valuable and are yielding a lower earnings credit rate overdraftinsufficient funds charges totaled million million consumer and million commercial during the three months ended march compared to million million consumer and million commercial during the same period in the increases in overdraftinsufficient funds charges were partly due to increased transaction volumes during the three months ended march compared to the same period in in response to the economic pressures and uncertainties faced by our customers as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have begun to waive certain deposit account related fees on a casebycase basis as needed and requested by our customers in some cases overdraftinsufficient funds charges are automatically waived or reimbursed we currently expect these actions to result in reduced service charges on deposit accounts insurance commissions and fees insurance commissions and fees for the three months ended march decreased million or compared to the same period in the decrease was related to decreases in commission income down million and contingent income down thousand the decrease in commission income was primarily related to decreases in benefit plan commissions life insurance commissions and commissions on commercial lines property and casualty policies the decrease in benefit plan commissions was related to decreased business volumes premium reductions and flat to lower market rates the decreases in property and casualty commissions and life insurance commissions were related to decreased business volumes contingent income totaled million during the three months ended march compared to million during the same period in contingent income primarily consists of amounts received from various property and casualty insurance carriers related to the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed these performance related contingent payments are seasonal in nature and are mostly received during the first quarter of each year this performance related contingent income totaled million and million during the three months ended march and respectively the decrease in performance related contingent income during was related to lower growth within the portfolio combined with a deterioration in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed contingent income also includes amounts received from various benefit plan insurance companies related to the volume of business generated andor the subsequent retention of such business this benefit plan related contingent income totaled thousand during the three months ended march and thousand during the same period in we currently expect commission income to be adversely impacted by reduced business volumes resulting from the covid19 pandemic we currently expect benefit plan commissions will be particularly impacted by the effects of temporary furloughs and permanent layoffs further clients may drop or adjust coverage choices as part of expense control measures as their businesses reopen from the temporary shutdown reduced business volumes are also expected to adversely impact the level of contingent commissions we receive in the covid19 pandemic has also given rise to a hard insurance market characterized by decreased capacity for most types of insurance coupled with more stringent underwriting standards among insurers which could potentially result in reduced commissions to agencies interchange and debit card transaction fees interchange fees or swipe fees are charges that merchants pay to us and other cardissuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions interchange and debit card transaction fees consist of income from debit card usage point of sale income from pinbased debit card transactions and atm service fees interchange and debit card transaction fees are reported net of related network costs a comparison of gross and net interchange and debit card transaction fees for the reported periods is presented in the table below we currently expect that revenue from interchange and debit card transactions will be impacted by reduced transaction volumes and fee waivers resulting from the covid19 pandemic three months ended march income from debit card transactions atm service fees gross interchange and debit card

realized on the sales during the first quarter of we sold million of residential mortgagebacked securities and realized a net gain of million on those sales the proceeds from these sales were reinvested into other residential mortgagebacked securities that had lower prepayment rates we also sold million of us treasury securities during the first quarter of and realized a net gain of million on those sales these us treasury securities were purchased during the fourth quarter of to hedge in effect against falling interest rates prior to their sale these securities had significant unrealized holding gains as a result of decreases in market interest rates during the first quarter of we elected to sell these securities to provide liquidity and realize the gains the sales of securities during the first quarter of were primarily related to securities purchased and subsequently sold in the same period of their purchase in connection with our tax planning strategies related to the texas franchise tax the gross proceeds from the sales of these securities outside of texas are included in total revenuesreceipts from all sources reported for texas franchise tax purposes which results in a reduction in the overall percentage of revenuesreceipts apportioned to texas and subjected to taxation under the texas franchise tax other noninterest income other noninterest

a combined net periodic pension expense of thousand during the same period in our defined benefit retirement and restoration plans were frozen effective as of december and were replaced by a profit sharing plan which was merged with and into our 401k plan during management believes these actions helped to reduce the volatility in retirement plan expense however we still have funding obligations related to the defined benefit and restoration plans and could recognize retirement expense related to these plans in future years which would be dependent on the return earned on plan assets the level of interest rates and employee turnover a prolonged negative impact on the value of stocks and other asset classes due to the covid19 pandemic could result in a significant reduction to pension plan asset values and expected returns which could impact the level of future funding and expense see note defined benefit plans for additional information related to our net periodic pension

similarly impact aggregate deposit insurance expense intangible amortization intangible amortization is primarily related to core deposit intangibles and to a lesser extent intangibles related to customer relationships and noncompete agreements intangible amortization for the three months ended march decreased thousand or compared to the same period in the decrease in amortization during was primarily related to the completion of amortization of certain previously recognized intangible assets as well as a reduction in the annual amortization rate of certain previously recognized

income partly offset by a million increase in noninterest income and a million decrease in income tax expense net interest income for the three months ended march decreased million or compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily related to decreases in the average yields on loans interestbearing deposits and federal funds sold and resell agreements combined with decreases in the average volumes of taxexempt and taxable securities based on amortized cost and an increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities the impact of these items was partly offset by decreases in the average cost of interestbearing deposits and other borrowed funds increases in the average volumes of loans and interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve and increases in the average yields on taxable and taxexempt securities net interest income for the first quarter of was also positively impacted by the additional day as a result of leap year see the analysis of net interest income included in the section captioned net interest income included elsewhere in this discussion credit loss expense for the three months

decrease in gains on the sale of foreclosed and other assets as we realized gains on the sale of various branch and operational facilities totaling million during the three months ended march the increase in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily related to an increase in commercial service charges which was partly due to a lower earnings credit rate given to our treasury management customers due to lower average market interest rates and increases in overdraftinsufficient funds charges on consumer and commercial accounts which was partly due to increased transaction volumes the decrease in insurance commissions and fees was partly related to decreases in business volumes and for benefit plan commissions premium reductions and flat to lower market rates the decrease was also

negatively impacted by an increase in other noninterest expense which was primarily due to an increase in professional services expense among other things and a decrease in other noninterest income which was primarily due to a decrease in mineral interest income the impact from these items was mostly offset by a decrease in net interest expense which was primarily related to a decrease in

march compared to million for an effective tax rate of for the three months ended march the effective income tax rates differed from the us statutory federal income tax rate of during and primarily due to the effect of taxexempt income from loans securities and life insurance policies and the income tax effects associated with stockbased compensation among other things and their relative

ppp loans as described below we have not experienced any unusual or significant declines or increases in our loan portfolio since march nonetheless it is possible that the effects of covid19 could result in less demand for our loan products commercial and industrial commercial and industrial loans increased million or during the first three months of our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small medium and large businesses the purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment while some shortterm loans may be made on an unsecured basis most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with our loan policy guidelines the commercial and industrial loan portfolio also includes commercial leases and purchased shared national credits sncs energy energy loans include loans to entities and individuals that are engaged in various energyrelated activities including

was included in the energy and commercial and industrial portfolio with the remainder included in the real estate categories snc participations are originated in the normal course of business to meet the needs of our customers as a matter of policy we generally only participate in sncs for companies headquartered in or which have significant operations within our market areas in addition we must have direct access to the companys management an existing banking relationship or the expectation of broadening the relationship with other banking products and services within the following to months

other loans increased million or from december the consumer and other loan portfolio primarily consists of automobile loans overdrafts unsecured revolving credit products personal loans secured by cash and cash equivalents and other similar types of credit facilities paycheck protection program in april we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the ppp administered by the sba under the provisions of the cares act loans covered by the ppp may be eligible for loan forgiveness for certain costs incurred related to payroll group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage rent and utility payments the remaining loan balance after forgiveness of any amounts is still fully guaranteed by the sba terms of the ppp loans include the following i maximum amount limited to the lesser of million or an amount calculated using a payrollbased formula ii maximum loan term of two years iii interest rate of iv no collateral or personal guarantees are required v no payments are required for six months following the loan disbursement date and vi loan forgiveness up to the full principal amount of the loan and any accrued interest subject to certain requirements including that no more than of the loan forgiveness amount may be attributable to nonpayroll costs in return for processing and booking the loan the sba will pay the lender a processing fee tiered by the size of the loan for loans of not more than thousand for loans more than thousand and less than million and for loans of at least million through april we have funded approximately billion of sbaapproved ppp loans to over customers we expect to recognize approximately million in ppp loan related processing fees as a yield adjustment over the terms of these loans we are currently considering participation in the federal reserves ppp facility which through september will extend loans to banks who are loaning money to small businesses under the ppp should we ultimately participate in the ppp facility amounts borrowed would be nonrecourse and secured by and limited to the amount of the ppp loans we originate the maturity date of a borrowing under the ppp facility is equal the maturity date of the ppp loan pledged to secure the borrowing and would be accelerated i if the underlying ppp loan goes into default and is sold to the sba to realize on the sba guarantee or ii to the extent that any loan forgiveness reimbursement is received from the sba borrowings under the ppp facility will bear interest at a rate of and there would be no fees to us federal bank regulatory agencies have issued an interim final rule that permits banks to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of participating in the ppp and if applicable the ppp facility specifically all ppp loans have a zero percent risk weight under applicable riskbased capital rules additionally a bank may exclude all ppp loans pledged as collateral to the ppp facility from its average total consolidated assets for the purposes of calculating its leverage ratio while ppp loans that are not pledged as collateral to the ppp facility will be included purported class action lawsuits have been filed against frost bank in federal and texas state courts alleging among other claims unspecified violations of the cares act and the sbas 7a loan program in connection with frost banks participation in the ppp the lawsuits seek monetary damages and injunctive relief frost bank believes the claims to be without merit nonperforming assets nonperforming assets and accruing past due loans are

restructured loans and commercial and industrial loans partly offset by increases in nonaccrual construction loans and consumer real estate loans generally loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become days past due andor management deems the collectibility of the principal andor interest to be in question as well as when required by regulatory requirements once interest accruals are discontinued accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans included one credit relationship in excess of million totaling million at march this credit relationship was previously reported as nonaccrual with an aggregate balance of million at december nonaccrual energy loans included two credit relationships in excess of million totaling million at march both credit relationships were previously reported as nonaccrual with an aggregate balance of million at december we charged off million related to these credit relationships during the three months ended march nonaccrual real estate loans primarily consist of land

estate foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value less estimated selling costs at the time of foreclosure writedowns occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses regulatory guidelines require us to reevaluate the fair value of foreclosed assets on at least an annual basis our policy is to comply with the regulatory guidelines writedowns are provided for subsequent declines in value and are included in other noninterest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties writedowns of foreclosed assets totaled thousand during the three months ended march while there were no writedowns of foreclosed assets during the three months ended march accruing past due loans at march increased million compared to december the increase was primarily related to increases in past due commercial real estate loans up million commercial and industrial loans up million and energy loans million potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of an obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of the obligors potential operating or financial difficulties management monitors these loans closely and reviews their performance on a regular basis at march and december we had million and million in loans of this type which are not included in any one of the nonperforming nonaccrual restructured or days past due loan categories at march potential problem loans consisted of eleven credit relationships of the total outstanding balance at march was related to the energy industry and was related to the restaurant industry weakness in these organizations operating performance and financial condition among other factors have caused us to heighten the attention given to these credits certain borrowers are currently unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of covid19 in an effort to mitigate the adverse effects of covid19 on our loan customers we are providing them the opportunity to defer payments or portions thereof for up to days should they so request in the absence of other intervening factors such shortterm modifications made on a good faith basis are not categorized as troubled debt restructurings nor are loans granted payment deferrals related to covid19 reported as past due or placed on nonaccrual status provided the loans were not past due or on nonaccrual status prior to the deferral the covid19 pandemic has contributed to an increased risk of delinquencies defaults and foreclosures we currently expect that a significant number and amount of our loans will experience ratings downgrades credit deterioration and defaults in many industries particularly energy aviation restaurants hotelslodging entertainment retail and commercial real estate among others see additional information about the effects of and risks associated with the covid19 pandemic in the section captioned recent developments related to covid19 elsewhere in this discussion and part ii other information item risk factors elsewhere in this report allowance for credit losses as discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements our policies and procedures related to accounting for credit losses changed on january in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in accounting standards codification asc topic asc financial instruments credit losses in the case of loans and securities allowances for credit losses are contraasset valuation accounts calculated in accordance with asc that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses is a liability account calculated in accordance with asc reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of each allowance account represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses cecl on these financial instruments considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts while historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfoliospecific risk characteristics environmental conditions or other relevant factors while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our portfolios the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets for additional information regarding critical accounting policies refer to note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements allowance for credit losses loans the table below provides as of the dates indicated an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segment however allocation of a portion of the allowance to one segment does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other segments march post asc adoption on january december commercial and industrial energy commercial real estate consumer real estate consumer and other total upon the adoption of asc on january the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans estimated using the cecl methodology decreased million compared to the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans estimated as of december using the prior incurred loss model fluctuations in the estimated allowances by portfolio segment offset one another for the most part and as a result the overall estimated amount of allowance for credit losses did not significantly change as a result of the change in methodology the manner in which credit loss allowances are allocated to the individual portfolio segments was partly impacted by a change in the way the underlying loans within each segment are pooled for modeling purposes the impact of varying economic conditions and portfolio stress factors are now a component of the credit loss models applied to each modeling pool in that regard the amounts allocated to the underlying pools of loans within each portfolio segment more directly reflect the economic variables and portfolio stress factors that correlate with credit losses within each portfolio under the prior methodology allocations in excess of those derived from historical loss rates were recognized as an overlay on each of the various portfolios based upon management judgment nonetheless despite fluctuations in the allocation of portions of the overall allowance to the various portfolio segments the entire allowance is available to absorb any credit losses within the entire loan portfolio the remainder of this discussion focuses on expected credit losses estimated as of march compared to the post asc estimate of expected credit losses as of january the allowance allocated to commercial and industrial loans totaled million or of total commercial and industrial loans at march increasing million or compared to million or of total commercial and industrial loans post asc adoption on january modeled expected credit losses increased million while qfactor adjustments related to commercial and industrial loans increased million specific allocations for commercial and industrial loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis increased from million post asc adoption on january to million at march the allowance allocated to energy loans totaled million or of total energy loans at march increasing million or compared to million or of total energy loans post asc adoption on january modeled expected credit losses related to energy loans increased million while qfactor adjustments related to energy loans increased million specific allocations for energy loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis totaled million post asc adoption on january the loans to which these specific allocations were related were subsequently charged off and there were no specific allocations at march the allowance allocated to commercial real estate loans totaled million or of total commercial real estate loans at march increasing million or compared to million or of total commercial real estate loans post asc adoption on january modeled expected credit losses related to commercial real estate loans increased million while qfactor adjustments related to commercial real estate loans increased million specific allocations for commercial real estate loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis increased from thousand post asc adoption on january to million at march the allowance allocated to consumer real estate loans totaled million or of total consumer real estate loans at march increasing million or compared to million

real estate loans increased thousand the allowance allocated to consumer loans totaled million or of total consumer loans at march increasing million or compared to million or of total consumer loans post asc adoption on january modeled expected credit losses related to consumer loans increased million while qfactor adjustments related to consumer loans increased thousand as more fully described in note loans in the accompanying consolidated financial statements we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of models which measure probability of default and loss given default among other things the measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loanborrower attributes and certain macroeconomic variables models are adjusted to reflect current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period in estimating expected credit losses as of march we utilized the moodys analytics march s8 low oil price scenario the s8 scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models the s8 scenario used the moodys baseline forecast updated during the week of march adjusted to assume that the price per barrel of west texas intermediate wti crude oil will remain at flat for two years the s8 scenario also assumed the persistence of the oil price war between saudi arabia and russia and increasing oil supplies in the face of decreasing global demand at that time the s8 scenario forecasted declines in the us gross domestic product and the texas gross state product in the second quarter of a flat us unemployment rate for the remainder of and the 10yr treasury rate dropping to in second quarter of and remaining below until the second quarter of the low oil prices incorporated in the s8 scenario also resulted in a forecasted gradual increase in the texas unemployment rate from in the first quarter of to by the first quarter of exceeding the forecasted us unemployment rate of for the first quarter of and reflecting the impact of oil prices on the overall texas economy the economic forecast used in our initial estimate of expected credit losses under asc on january projected that the texas unemployment rate would remain below through the increases in modeled expected credit losses across all of our loan portfolios as of march compared to the modeled expected credit losses as of our initial adoption of asc on january were primarily the result of changes in portfolio volumes and risk attributes as discussed below and also partly related to the changes in our economic forecast the overall loan portfolio increased million or which included a million or increase in commercial and industrial loans and a million or increase in commercial real estate loan partly offset by an million or decrease in energy loans the weighted average risk grade for commercial and industrial loans remained unchanged totaling at both march and december commercial and industrial loans graded watch and special mention risk grades and increased million during the first quarter of while classified commercial and industrial loans decreased million classified loans consist of loans having a risk grade of or the weightedaverage risk grade for energy loans increased to at march from at december the increase in weighted average risk grade was primarily related to a million increase in classified loans while non classified loans decreased million the weighted average risk grade for commercial real estate loans increase to at march from at december commercial real estate loans graded as watch increased million while classified commercial real estate loans decreased million as noted above our credit loss models utilized the economic forecasts in the moodys s8 scenario from the week of march in late march and early april moodys updated various macroeconomic variables in moodys baseline forecast subsequent to our modeling processes in order to incorporate the expected economic impact of recent developments related to the covid19 pandemic given the level of economic disruption and uncertainty within the state of texas and the nation as a whole arising from the covid19 pandemic and volatility and declines in oil and gas prices driven by decreased demand and increased supply we qualitatively adjusted the model results for these and other risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools these qfactor adjustments are discussed below also see the section captioned recent developments related to covid19 elsewhere in this discussion and part ii other information item risk factors elsewhere in this report qfactor adjustments are based upon management judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures economic and business conditions loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations and external factors among other things management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment as a result of this assessment as of march modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weightedaverage qfactor adjustment of approximately this weightedaverage qfactor adjustment is based upon a severely negative expected impact from changes in economic and business conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic and a negative to limited negative expected impact associated with changes in loan portfolio attributes and concentrations risk grades and other practices and procedures the depth and experience of lending staff in dealing with potential issues related to credit deterioration and potential deterioration of collateral values the weightedaverage qfactor adjustment also includes a upward adjustment to modeled expected credit losses related to risks associated with model uncertainty and underprediction this adjustment was based upon the results of certain back testing procedures performed on our credit loss models in connection with our assessment of qfactor adjustments for our initial estimate of expected credit losses upon the adoption of asc on january modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weightedaverage qfactor adjustment of approximately which also included the aforementioned upward adjustment related to model uncertainty and underprediction we expect to continue to adjust modeled expected credit loss results for model uncertainty and underprediction until such time as the models are enhanced and the degree of uncertainty and underprediction is reduced management also made certain other qualitative adjustments for loans within certain industries that are expected to be more significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic and oil price volatility and declines as described below in early march saudi arabia announced significant price discounts on oil which resulted in a sharp decrease in global oil prices including the benchmark wti saudi arabia further announced that it would significantly increase its production leading russia to respond in kind these actions arose in the face of increasing global supplies and decreasing global demand the subsequent worsening global economic outlook and decreased demand resulting from the covid19 pandemic resulted in further decreases in energy prices the wti price per barrel of crude oil was approximately per barrel on march down from approximately per barrel as of december in late march we established a special energy oversight council to oversee and assess the credit quality of our energy loan portfolio as of march we provided an additional million of qualitative adjustments for our energy loan portfolio in assessing the energy portfolio for the additional qualitative adjustment we performed a series of different stress testing exercises to assess borrowing base deficiencies for energy production loans the final stress testing exercise approved by management was based on an oil price deck of in and increasing to in in and thereafter from this exercise we determined which borrowers had a borrowing base deficiency we further identified which of these borrowers we believed to have strong secondary sources of capital and those that did not we determined that the borrowers with insufficient secondary sources of capital had an aggregate net borrowing based deficiency of approximately million we concluded that this amount should serve as the minimum level of expected credit losses for energy production loans accordingly we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of million for this category of energy loans we performed a separate assessment of other energy loans which includes borrowers associated with transportation and logistics equipment manufacturing and energy services among other things over half of this portfolio of energy loans was made up of a small number of borrowers with loans in excess of million based upon further analysis of these loans we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of million as of april the wti price per barrel of crude oil was approximately oil prices continue to be impacted by concerns that the demand for oil will remain depressed as the covid19 pandemic has led to a sharp decrease in global travel and business activity in other energyheavy industries excess oil supply has compounded concerns related to oil storage capacity as the cost for producers to store unused oil has begun to exceed the value of the underlying oil while its effects continue to materialize the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the state of texas as well as nationally efforts to limit the spread of covid19 have led to the closure of nonessential businesses travel restrictions supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings among other things throughout many parts of the united states and in particular the markets in which we operate aside from the energy industry which is discussed above we lend to customers operating in certain other industries that have been and are expected to be more significantly impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic these industries include with outstanding balances as of march restaurants approximately million or of total loans hotelslodging approximately million or of total loans aviation approximately million or of total loans entertainment approximately million or of total loans and retail approximately million or of total loans we are continuing to monitor these customers closely in assessing these portfolios for an additional qualitative adjustment as of march we performed a comprehensive review of the financial condition and overall outlook of the borrowers within these portfolios based on this analysis we determined that these portfolios had an elevated level of risk due to nationwide and global restrictions impacting each of these industries as a result we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of million of which million was allocated to commercial real estate loans and million was allocated to commercial and industrial loans according to department of labor statistical data in the final week of march there was a record number of initial unemployment insurance claims totaling million for the entire month initial claims totaled in excess of million through april the fourweek moving average of initial unemployment claims was approximately million per week the rapid rate and magnitude of job losses is unprecedented during this time the us government has also enacted certain monetary and fiscal stimulus measures in several phases to counteract the economic disruption caused by the covid19 such measures are more fully discussed in the section captioned recent developments related to covid19 elsewhere in this discussion the success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the covid19 pandemic in light of this uncertainty as well as other uncertainties related to unemployment trends and how long business closures and restrictions on travel and public gatherings will continue we determined that our consumer and other portfolio had an elevated level of risk particularly related to the performance unsecured loans within this portfolio as a result we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of thousand for these loans activity in the allowance for credit losses on loans is presented in the following table three months ended march balance at beginning of period impact of adopting asc credit loss expense chargeoffs commercial and industrial energy commercial real estate consumer real estate consumer and other total chargeoffs recoveries commercial and industrial energy commercial real estate consumer real estate consumer and other total recoveries net chargeoffs balance at end of period ratio of allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans nonaccrual loans ratio of annualized net chargeoffs to average total loans credit loss expense related to loans increased million during the three months ended march compared to the same period in credit loss expense related to loans during the three months ended march primarily reflects the increase in expected credit losses resulting from a deterioration in forecasted economic conditions and the current and uncertain future impacts associated with the covid19 pandemic and the sharp decline in oil prices credit loss expense also reflects the level of net chargeoffs the deterioration of credit quality and the overall growth in the loan portfolio during the first quarter of the ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was at march compared to at december management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is appropriate based upon managements best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change our estimate of current expect credit losses could also change which could affect the level of future credit loss expense related to loans allowance for credit losses offbalancesheet credit exposures upon the adoption of asc on january the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures estimated using the cecl methodology increased million compared to the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures estimated as of december using the prior incurred loss model the increase reflects the impact of assuming portions of all of these commitments will fund in the future and applying our credit loss modeling processes to such amounts as if such amounts were funded loans previously we only recognized a liability for estimated incurred credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures when the borrowers to which such commitments were extended exceeded certain risk grades and had not violated any underlying covenants that would relieve us of any obligation to fund additional amounts under the commitment subsequent to the adoption of asc on january we recognized credit loss expense related to offbalancesheet credit exposures totaling million during the first quarter of to increase the amount of the related allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures to million as of march the increase primarily reflects changes in underlying risk grades and expected utilization of available funds an increase in overall offbalancesheet credit exposures and a deterioration in forecasted economic conditions and the current and uncertain future impacts associated with covid19 further information regarding our policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures is presented in note offbalancesheet arrangements commitments guarantees and contingencies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements capital and liquidity capital shareholders equity totaled billion at both march and december in addition to net income of million other sources of capital during the three months ended march included other comprehensive income net of tax of million million related to stockbased compensation and million in proceeds from stock option exercises uses of capital during the three months ended march included a million redemption of preferred stock million of dividends paid on preferred and common stock million related to the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting principle and million of treasury stock purchases see note significant accounting policies the accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss component of shareholders equity totaled a net aftertax unrealized gain of million at march compared to million at december the change was primarily due to a million net aftertax increase in the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale under the basel iii capital rules we have elected to optout of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital accordingly amounts reported as accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss do not increase or reduce regulatory capital and are not included in the calculation of our regulatory capital ratios in connection with the adoption of asc on january we also elected to exclude for a transitional period the effects of credit loss accounting under cecl in the calculation of our regulatory capital and regulatory capital ratios regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both onbalancesheet and offbalancesheet items see note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report we paid a quarterly dividend of and per common share during the first quarters of and respectively this equates to a common stock dividend payout ratio of and during the first three months of and respectively our ability to declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our capital stock may be impacted by certain restrictions described in note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report preferred stock on march we redeemed all  of our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series a series a preferred stock at a redemption price of per share or an aggregate redemption of million when issued the net proceeds of the series a preferred stock totaled million after deducting million of issuance costs including the underwriting discount and professional service fees among other things upon redemption these issuance costs were reclassified to retained earnings and reported as a reduction of net income available to common shareholders stock repurchase plans from time to time our board of directors has authorized stock repurchase plans in general stock repurchase plans allow us to proactively manage our capital position and return excess capital to shareholders shares purchased under such plans also provide us with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards on july our board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase shares of our common stock over a one year period from time to time at various prices in the open market or through private transactions we repurchased  at a total cost of million during the first quarter of and  at a total cost of million during the third quarter of in light of the uncertainties arising from the covid19 pandemic we currently do not anticipate any further repurchases of common stock under this stock repurchase program see note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and part ii item unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds each included elsewhere in this report liquidity as more fully discussed in our form 10k our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate liquidity risk management is an important element in our assetliability management process we regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions volatility in the financial markets unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management these scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs our principal source of funding has been our customer deposits supplemented by our shortterm and longterm borrowings as well as maturities of securities and loan amortization as of april we had approximately billion held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve we also have the ability to borrow funds as a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb as of march based upon available pledgeable collateral our total borrowing capacity with the fhlb was approximately billion furthermore at march we had approximately billion in securities that were unencumbered by a pledge and could be used to support additional borrowings through repurchase agreements or the federal reserve discount window as needed as further discussed in the section captioned loans elsewhere in this discussion in april we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the ppp administered by the sba through april we have funded approximately billion of sbaapproved ppp loans to over customers we expect to recognize approximately million in ppp loan related processing fees as a yield adjustment over the terms of these loans in april we borrowed million from the fhlb under the covid19 relief program to provide supplemental funding for ppp loan originations the shortterm fullrecourse advance has a term of six months and bears interest at an annualized rate of we are also considering participation in the federal reserves ppp facility which is further discussed in the section captioned loans elsewhere in this discussion federal bank regulatory agencies have issued an interim final rule that permits banks to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of participating in the ppp and if applicable the ppp facility specifically all ppp loans have a zero percent risk weight under applicable riskbased capital rules additionally a bank may exclude all ppp loans pledged as collateral to the ppp facility from its average total consolidated assets for the purposes of calculating its leverage ratio while ppp loans that are not pledged as collateral to the ppp facility will be included since cullenfrost is a holding company and does not conduct operations its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from frost bank and borrowings from outside sources banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by frost bank see note capital and regulatory matters in the accompanying
