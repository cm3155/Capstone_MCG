thanks ab good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us we are here to review second quarter results and our chief financial officer jerry salinas is going to provide some additional comments before we open it up to your questions and in the second quarter cullenfrost earned million or per share compared with earnings of million or a share reported in the same quarter last year that represents a increase over last years level our return on average assets and average common equity in the second quarter were and respectively and that compares with and for the same period last year once again im proud of the solid performance turned in by our outstanding staff in this unusual economic environment the continued rate increases by the federal reserve and their fight against inflation have had their intended effect by slowing some segments of the market in addition increasing rates continue to raise the opportunity cost for businesses holding cash in liquid deposits these impacts are to be expected through the rate cycle and will continue to play themselves out during this period and jerry will provide some great insight into their nearterm effects as we said last time during the second quarter cullenfrost did not take on any federal home loan bank advances participate in any special liquidity facility or government borrowing access any brokered deposits or utilize any reciprocal insurance arrangements to build insured deposit percentages but notwithstanding all that we believe the most important thing for us to focus on at this time is that we are successfully executing our mission to grow and prosper building longterm relationships based on top quality service high ethical standards and safe sound assets and i believe the results for this quarter show we are doing just that and i am excited about our prospects and let me give you a few examples looking at our commercial and private banking business we had the best quarter ever for new customer relationships which were up from last year and were up from the previous quarter that was new relationships i think its also significant that almost half of those new relationships came from the largest banks we affectionally know as too big to fail now i normally wouldnt go into this level of detail but im going to read to you the unannualized linked quarter growth rates in new relationships by region because i think its fascinating and tells me that its not an isolated occurrence in one specific market houston led all regions with net new relationships which was up from the previous quarter dallas produced net new relationships which was up san antonio produced net new relationships which was up fort worth produced net new relationships which was up austin produced net new relationships which was up the gulf coast and victoria regions produced net new relationships which is up by and the permian basin produced net new relationships which was up by remember these numbers are not annualized to me this says that we are winning competitively looking at our commercial lending business we saw an increase in activity related to new opportunities up and an increase in our probability weighted pipeline by from the first quarter so were seeing deal flow in fact we looked at more deals than the first quarter but that said booked deals were down because we declined more and more deals were withdrawn by the customer were obviously being more careful in this environment but i think the increases in opportunities is notable cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 ill also say that unlike the previous quarter we saw more opportunities from our customers than prospects prospect opportunities were up for the first quarter from the first quarter but customers were up looking at our consumer business in the second quarter we set an alltime high for net new relationships at this beat our previous alltime high which was achieved in the first quarter by an unannualized our houston market where we have the most mature expansion effort leads the way here with net new relationships while dallas and san antonio produced about each consumer loans ended the quarter at billion a increase from the second quarter of last year and continues to be driven by consumer real estate as our home improvement and home equity products continue to provide the right product at the right time for customers with low rate mortgages and great credit scores included in those numbers were over million in mortgage loans as a part of our measured rollout of this product beginning in the dallas market toward the end of the second quarter we announced our upcoming expansion into the austin region which will build upon the momentum from our houston and dallas expansions we plan to double the number of locations we have in the austin area from to austin is texas third largest deposit market and we already ranked fourth in deposit share these locations will have a strong legacy to build on our houston expansion including the original locations plus the additional ones which we call houston the most recent of which just opened in friendswood last week our expansion branches there are at of household goal of our loan goal and of our deposit goal expansion in houston now represents billion in deposits and about million in loans for our dallas expansion although its early we stand at of new household goal of our loan goal of our deposit goal expansion in dallas currently represents million in deposits and million in loans so all told we have about billion in deposits from the expansion and about billion a little over billion in loans credit quality continues to be good by historical standards problem loans which we define as risk grade or higher totaled million at the end of the second quarter and thats up from million at the end of the first quarter and million from this time last year nonperforming loans totaled million at the end of the second quarter compared with million at the end of the first quarter the result of two credits and the second quarter figure represents just basis points of total loans and basis points of total assets net charge offs for the second quarter were million up from million at the end of the first quarter and annualized net charge offs for the second quarter represented basis points of average loans and yeartodate charge offs are basis points of loans which is below our historic average regarding commercial real estate our overall portfolio remains stable with steady operating performance across asset types and acceptable debt service coverage ratios and loan to values within this portfolio what wed consider to be the major categories of investor cre theyre comprised for example of office multifamily retail and industrial and as examples we totaled billion of outstandings are about of commercial real estate loans outstanding in total our investor commercial real estate portfolio has held up well exhibiting an overall average loan to value of about and loan to cost of about and acceptable reported debt service coverage ratios our interest rates have certainly led to some decline in coverage ratios compared to original underwriting performance but weve actually seen some improvement in coverage ratios quarteroverquarter for the already cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 stabilized properties in our portfolio for example of our investor office portfolio is stabilized and average debt service coverage ratios increased from to this quarter and we saw a similar trend in the stabilized portion of the multifamily portfolio the investor office portfolio which is still top of mind was relatively flat quarteroverquarter with million outstanding it exhibited an average loan to value of and an average debt service coverage ratio of at current interest rates starting from strong position with a cushion for potential value declines our comfort level with the office portfolio continues to be based on the character and experience of our borrowers and sponsors the predominantly class a nature of our office buildings and the fact that of the exposure is associated with stabilized wellperforming projects it also helps to be operating in texas we did have an million office building loan that weve been watching migrate to nonaccrual during the quarter but overall the office portfolio and really entire investor cre portfolio did not experiencing identification of anything material in terms of weak or underperforming credits or projects that we were not already watching so to conclude as i said earlier im proud of our performance and what our bankers have been able to accomplish as well as the competitive success we continue to exhibit in our markets and now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil i wanted to start off first by talking a little bit about our houston expansion results as a reminder the last of those branches was opened in so these branches are still in what i call the development stage as phil mentioned weve been very pleased with the volumes weve been able to achieve looking at the second quarter linkedquarter annualized growth in average balances for these locations was for deposits and for loans and for the second quarter houston contributed to our quarterly earnings per share now moving to our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the second quarter was down basis points from the reported last quarter the decrease included some positives that were more than offset by some negatives on the positive side higher yields on loans and balances at the fed combined with higher loan volumes were more than offset by higher cost of deposits and customer repos and lower deposit levels at the fed compared to the first quarter looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the second quarter down million from the first quarter during the quarter we did not make any material investment purchases during the quarter we sold about million in municipal securities as we took advantage of market dislocations which allowed us to improve interest income going forward weve recognized a net gain of about on those transactions the net unrealized loss on the availableforsale portfolio at the end of the quarter was billion an increase of million from the billion reported at the end of the first quarter the net unrealized loss on the heldtomaturity portfolio at the end of the quarter was million up million from the first quarter the taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio in the second quarter was flat with the first quarter the taxable portfolio which averaged billion up approximately million from the prior quarter had a yield of up basis points from the prior quarter our taxexempt municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the second quarter down about million from the first quarter and had a taxable equivalent yield of up basis points from the prior quarter at the end of the second quarter approximately of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psf insured cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the second quarter was years down from years at the end of the first quarter looking at deposits on a linkedquarter basis average deposits were down billion or with about of the decrease coming from noninterest bearing deposits i want to talk a little bit more about our noninterest bearing deposits which totaled billion at the end of the quarter with of that amount being commercial demand deposits during the individual months of the second quarter we did see the average balance in the non interest bearing accounts began to stabilize during last quarters call we said that we expected deposits to continue to decline as this has historically been our seasonal trend that deposits peak in the fourth quarter and reach their low in the second quarter before beginning to grow in the second half of the year i also noted that april noninterest bearing deposits were down million from march and that we expected that april average to decline given the anticipated impact of seasonality including tax payments april noninterest bearing balances decreased million from march almost million more on average than at the time of our call these average balances then decreased million in may with the average affected by tax payments in april and then decreased million in june and monthtodate through yesterday july average balances are down million from the june average the june and july average balances have seen the pace of outflow began to slow down and we are anticipating that slower pace of outflows to continue but with interest rates at these levels there continues to be uncertainty with these customer balances customers have attractive risk reward options in this rate cycle that didnt necessarily present themselves in the last cycle which provides them with multiple options for the utilization of these funds looking at total interestbearing deposits theyve been relatively stable during the period average interest bearing deposits were billion during the quarter down million or from the first quarter we do continue to see a shift in the mix to higher cost cds from the lower cost savings ioc and mma the cost of interestbearing deposits in the second quarter was up basis points from in the first quarter customer repos for the second quarter averaged billion down million from the billion average in the first quarter as we saw some flows out of our repo product including for tax payments during the quarter the cost of customer repos for the quarter was up basis points from the first quarter looking at noninterest income on a linkedquarter basis i just wanted to point out a couple of items trust and investment management fees were up million or compared to the first quarter driven by increases in estate fees of million real estate fees of and investment fees of estate fees and real estate fees can fluctuate based on the number of estates settled or property sold respectively insurance commissions and fees were down million or from the first quarter driven by lower pc contingent bonuses down million benefit commissions down million and life commissions down partly offsetting these unfavorable variances was a million increase in pc commissions when compared to the first quarter as a reminder the first quarter is typically our strongest quarter for insurance revenues given we typically recognize contingent income in that quarter and are also impacted by our natural business cycle the second quarter is typically our weakest quarter for insurance revenues again impacted by our normal renewal business volumes looking at our projection of full year total noninterest expenses as i mentioned last quarter we currently expect total noninterest expense for the full year to increase at a percentage rate in the midteens over our reported levels this does not include the potential impact of the fdic special assessment which has not yet been finalized the effective tax rate for the first six months of the year was or about excluding cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 discrete items our current expectation is that our fullyear effective tax rate for should approximate but that can be affected by discrete items during the rest of the year regarding our stock buyback i want to mention that during the second quarter we utilized about million of our million approved share repurchase to buyback approximately  at an average price of regarding the estimate for fullyear earnings our current projections dont include any additional changes to the fed funds rate through the rest of given that rate assumption and our expectation of noninterest expense growth of midteens which does not include the impact of the fdic special assessment we currently believe that the current mean of analyst estimates of is a little high with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc all right thanks jerry and now well open it up for your questions question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions todays first question is coming from brady gailey of kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good afternoon guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so your net interest margin has held in very well especially relative to the industry which saw nim slippage by a decent amount this quarter for most of your peers do you expect the net interest margin to continue to hold in relatively well or do you think that at some point you will see some real downside there jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc what id say brady i thought that last quarter i said it was going to be relatively stable i think id stick with that except that i would say that theres a downward bias as you know when i talked about the basis point decrease that we had between the first and the second quarter all those are positive and negatives are still kind cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 of affecting us going forward so id say kind of stable but again were probably more towards a little bit negative bias but i dont see it changing significantly or not based on anything im seeing brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then i know in the past you guys have talked about some of the financial impacts of expanding into a new market like austin i dont think theyve moved the numbers a ton but any guess on the financial impact of the austin expansion over the next year or two jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc brady well talk about that in january we really would give some guidance and obviously its going to be primarily expense based at the beginning as you know as we start putting those locations together i dont expect for that theyll have a significant impact so any impact well start feeling next year and well kind of give some color at the beginning of the year phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah id just might add brady that just the scope of its a little bit smaller just by its nature than dallas or houston the expansions that weve had there so pound for pound itll be about the same but the scope of its just a little bit smaller brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then finally for me npas are off theyre still at a very low level but i think i heard you mention two credits moved into the npa bucket one was a million office loan what was the other npa that went into that bucket this quarter phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah it was in the preowned auto sale dealership and the higher interest rates really impacted its carry costs and also the performance of some of the paper that it carries and so we thought it was appropriate to recognize that so it wasnt real estate related but it was in the automobiles area brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right great thank you guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 operator thank you the next question is coming from steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey steve jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start so on the noninterest bearing deposits last quarter you guys thought it would come down in and then stabilize and were seeing continued outflows im just curious whats taking customers so long to just reach that amount of operating cash that they need i find it hard to believe with every move theyre like digging deeper and deeper i would have thought it would pretty much be done by now jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think steven its as ive said in my comments i think the rate environment that were in is so unique and so different theres a lot more opportunities for them to invest that money its and really impressive rates and so even though i said that in my mind a couple of hundred million is certainly better than the million and million decreases that we were seeing but i do think that there continues to be volatility there i think theres just too many options for them to utilize that those funds whether its to pay off any debt that they might have or decide to invest it and investment could certainly be and weve seen some dollars obviously flow into our off balance sheet either trust areas or treasury areas so i think now im with you i kind of thought most of it was gone but i think in the environment were going to continue to see some pressure there i think the upside for us is as phil mentioned we really feel very positive about all the new relationships that were bringing in were see some pretty impressive deposit wins and in some cases those commercial wins take a little bit longer to get on the books and get them closed but i think in this rate environment were just going to continue to be cautious and i think everybody is going to have to make the decision on how they want to invest those funds and all we can really do is to continue to focus on growing the business and adding new customers steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then on the balance sheet you guys had good loan growth in the quarter more or less funded with securities if you just look at the movements on the asset side as we think about the back half jerry as maybe these noninterest bearing outflows subside a bit do you think well see net balance sheet growth in the second half or will you just continue to fund loan growth with other assets at runoff cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think that were projecting some small growth on the funding side at this point nothing really material again given the uncertainty that weve got on the commercial side our projections are really do have some growth but its not anything that i would say is significant steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks and then final one so phil i appreciate all the line items that you ran through by market in terms of customers that you guys are picking up im curious so your service is consistently good peers are consistently not as good what is it about this environment that youre seeing so many customers move banks thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah mr steven i think its a couple of things primarily when you look at our movement in terms of growth in new relationships the expansion no doubt has a really big effect on that and i think its really paying off in terms of growing those relationships overall weve also been spending more and focused more on marketing i think were doing a better job on marketing and then reputationally just to be honest weve got a great reputation and reputation for great service so its been pretty exciting as weve moved into some of these markets some cases we want i was thinking about one we opened up in i think its dallas just recently i think our the closest frost bank was miles away and the growth has just been tremendous so its i think its really simple i think we are investing in our business were growing our distribution in fantastic markets weve got a great value proposition for service and its just and were marketing and investing in marketing and technology i think its just all working together to win and i apologize for giving so much granularity on that but it just shows that thats really what were focused on is new relationships its part of our mission statement thats called out and were going to go through rate cycles up and down and were going to see movements of noninterest bearing deposits out and all that stuff thats going to happen but if we just focus on growing the business growing the relationships in great markets were going to do fine steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks and i appreciate all the detail for what its worth thanks for taking my questions phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc all right thank you operator thank you the next question is coming from dave rochester of compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc just going back to your eps outlook comment for i know you mentioned the stable nim with a downward bias so that that was helpful to hear was just wondering how youre expecting that to translate into nii trends for the back half of the year at this point are you thinking to ph stabilized nim and stable funding what you just mentioned would get you to ph stabilized nii or how are you thinking about that at this point as you look at your eps outlook jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i guess the thing that i would focus on is is kind of where we ended the quarter on the deposit side i mentioned to steven that were not projecting a whole lot of growth from there for the rest of the year and so thats obviously will have some impact on net interest income so i think thats really where the pressure is david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then regarding deposit trends you said earlier it sounded like ph youre baking in marginal deposit growth or marginal funding growth i guess in the back half are you assuming that dda continues to decline through that period as well i know you mentioned that the runoff has subsided a bit but is that the general expectation now you continue to have mix shift through the end of the year jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah and again were projecting growth but i think that on an annualized basis i think were at or something like that that were projecting whats interesting is of that is our legacy bank and is coming from our expansion so obviously theyre having an impact on our growth but that aside i think that gives you some perspective on the size of the deposit side that were projecting and i think the mix i would expect that its probably will not change a whole lot but if there is a movement i would expect that pressure continues to be more on the noninterestbearing side than on the interestbearing side and on the interestbearing side i think were starting to see some settlement there on rates but with this rate hike well actually obviously react to that but i think youll still see some movement of mix but it appears everythings stabilizing certainly a lot more than we saw just a quarter ago david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay and then just given where we are in the rate cycle have you guys been reducing asset sensitivity at all in the past quarter or do you have any plans to do that in the back half of the year just with swaps or anything else jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 i think right now were really kind of sitting tight were obviously looking at a lot of opportunities and things that we can do but at this point i wouldnt envision that were doing anything very drastic obviously asset sensitivity is diminishing as the balances that were holding at the fed are diminishing as were seeing that the decreases in noninterestbearing deposits but other than that not doing anything actively david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then maybe just one last one on expenses i appreciated the reiterated guide there it seems like just given where we are in the first half youre looking for a pretty deep rampup in the second half is that kind of what you guys are looking at this point is that likely to see that kind of a rampup jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah thats kind of what were saying we obviously review our projections monthly and talking to our lines of business and everything that were seeing certainly is pointing us in that direction david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay thanks guys operator thank you the next question is coming from manan gosalia from morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good afternoon i wanted to ask about the liquidity and the cash balance in the quarter i know the average was about billion which was i think sort of inline with where you had indicated balances were back in april so is it fair to say that you didnt utilize any of that through the quarter and now that the environment has stabilized do you plan to continue or would you use cash to support loan growth and deposit outflow or just given where fed rates are does it sort of make sense to keep cash at and continue to let the securities level come down jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah thats really where we are right now i think thats the sort of guidance we gave last quarter and you heard me say we didnt make any investment purchases i think at this point any decrease that weve seen in the cash balances at the fed and i think we were at the end of the quarter we were down to billion a little under of our deposit balances so at this point i think were pretty comfortable with that as you said looking at the ph million that were earning now were not looking to make any active moves on the investment portfolio at this point manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so can you remind us how much the securities portfolio how much of that should mature every quarter for the next year or so cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think for the rest of the year i think were at million say million with really million of it a third of it say a little bit more in the third on the last day of the month so the last part of the second half of is what id call a normal amount as we look at were probably talking something in the neighborhood of billion for the year manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator thank you the next question is coming from peter winter of da davidson please go ahead peter j winter q analyst da davidson co thanks i was curious whats the outlook for the deposit beta i think the original forecast was and then secondly do think that therell be pressure on this deposit beta next year as were in kind of a higher for longer rate environment and your interest rates on deposits are a little bit lower than peers jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc our cumulative beta through on interest bearing deposits through the second quarter was up from in the first quarter on total deposits that translates to at the end of the second quarter versus i would expect that we would go up to somewhere by the end of the year say in the given this last rate hike that were dealing with i think thats comparable to what weve looked at what weve done historically say the average of the last two cycles so but looking at not really in this environment not expecting peter that wed have to do much again itll be interesting to see where were at come january and what our expectations are but i dont envision weve kept up with deposit pricing and tried to be fair and obviously have gone out early to provide our customers with a fair deal so i dont expect that once if the fed has stopped hiking i dont expect that were going to have to do a lot of continuing to increase our betas if you will or increase our deposit rates after the hikes stop so no i dont really expect much change well have to see obviously were going to want to make sure that we continue to be competitive with our peers thats the one thing that we want to make sure but at this point if i had a crystal ball im not seeing a lot of pressure there at this point peter j winter q analyst da davidson co okay and then i just want to ask big picture im just a little bit surprised that maybe the deposit outlook is not a little bit stronger i mean i realize what the environment is like but every quarter you guys keep having this record new account growth both on the commercial bank the consumer bank the success with the branch build out cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 expansion and thats starting to take hold im just wondering why the deposit outlook is just not a little bit stronger with all this growth phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc well i think one thing peter is that that we need to consider as we answer the question ph i cant say from a broad perspective i cant say exactly why but one thing i can say is that we tend to have a lot more operational transactional accounts demand deposit accounts checking accounts than peers and i think those are more susceptible to opportunities that jerry has talked about so i think we got to work our way through that and then i think once we touch bottom youll get to see movement up im confident that were going to see traction from these new relationships one thing we saw early in the houston expansion was that when we looked at our performance versus goal on deposits we were better on relationships but we were under our goal in commercial deposits as far as balance and one thing that we learned was getting the relationship is one thing but theyve got to and this on the commercial side youve got to go through getting your customers to send their payments to a different place theres just a lot of operational things that have to happen before you as a business see the full effect of being the primary checking account take place and so i think thats part of it and but what weve seen is as weve grown relationships historically well see more and more of that companys business go through there and im confident were going to see that peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thanks for that phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc remember we dont count a relationship unless we get the primary checking account well do business with people we get different aspects of their business but you dont get to count it as a relationship unless you get the primary checking account peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thank you operator thank you the next question is coming from brandon king of truist securities please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good afternoon thanks for taking my questions jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brandon cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so i wanted to talk about the ph million office loan and could you please provide us with some details as far as what potentially makes that loan or property different from the rest of your office cre portfolio phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc okay well in the case of this one particular asset its one that lost a major tenant and it was one that is a newer relationship for us and that it came on right before covid came over i think is in january of and so theres not that same type of history a good reputational group but not the same kind of history with us and as they lost that tenant and then their debt service coverage numbers suffered as a result we felt like they needed to right size it to a certain extent they didnt agree with it and they were willing to do a smaller amount so its been restructured and its got itll perform for the next year but not to the level that we think it should and so weve got that on a nonaccrual and it was basically you just had a disagreement between the parties on what they should do as far as rightsizing the project in terms of the asset itself it is an office building loan but we booked it at the amount of the underlying real estate and it is a tremendous piece of real estate in a very dynamic area of houston and so im not concerned about valuation losses of any significance but because of where we are because it does cash flow to the place that we feel it needs to be we put it on nonaccrual and as far as whats different i mean look rates are higher and weve got a tremendous amount of projects and theyre not all going to be perfect and you could end up i think weve talked before maybe as i recall you could have a property that is an industrial property with a fortune credit tenant longterm leased and underwritten before covid or the current increases in rates it looks great right but the present value of that lease stream today is less and so equity suffers in the project and those types of things and theyve got to get worked out and well just see how it work out do we think therell be significant impact on loss no but were watching credits that look like that you might have a senior housing property that is kind of a different deal but i mean again this is the lending business therere all kinds of things that happen and so its a risk business but there are lots of properties that are being impacted and the main thing that were doing is were relying on the underwriting that we did indiscernible and the people that are backing it up the vast majority of which have been long term customers so were going to see some dislocation here and there sure we are but do things look good today on a historical basis and are we happy with the underwriting that weve done over time i am and well just see how it goes out over the cycle brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it very helpful and then my followup question is on the share repurchases during the quarter just kind of what led to that decision and what kind of appetite do you have for the rest of the year jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc we really just at the price like i said we were at and we just thought it was a deal that we really couldnt pass up obviously we didnt spend all of it we just thought given where the price was we thought it was a great value for us and we took advantage of that at this point out well be opportunistic well just if something like that happens again we may take advantage but at this point nothing planned cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc jerry is a great example of those people using those demand deposit balances brandon king q analyst truist securities inc thanks for taking my questions jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure brandon operator thank you the next question is coming from brody preston of ubs please go ahead brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good afternoon everyone jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i was hoping to follow up just on the on the securities question i just wanted to confirm what you said that it was million was that through the rest of the year with the large chunk at the likeonlike and then billion next year am i hearing that correctly jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yes sir you got it exactly brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc all right great do you happen to know what the yield on the securities thats rolling off is jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i can tell you something right off the top of my head we bought billion we talked about this we bought billion in treasury securities two years ago i guess a year and a half now when there was conversation about russia invading ukraine and we could we made that purchase as a defensive posture obviously i wouldnt make it wouldnt have made it we today we did that at so that first million comes off at the end of the year and its at i think it is and then the next million of that those proceeds come in within the first few weeks of january again at that same cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and i think you said earlier that you werent being too aggressive on new purchases but in terms of adding to the size of the book but is it safe to assume that you would look to replace that billion over the next months would you just look to kind of replace that or are you trying to move the size of the securities portfolio lower jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think all things being equal and by that again were talking about deposits a lot today and assuming that weve reached some sort of stabilization and start to grow i think the quick response would be yeah we would look to replace it but i think until we get to that point in time well have to see what else is going on on the balance sheet and make our decision at that point but obviously that could be a great positive or will be a great positive impact to nim and to net interest income in just even if we kept it at the fed brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and is there any bias towards any type of security i know you have a lot of the ph community bonds in texas i just didnt know if you would look to kind of replace treasury with treasury or it was anything more complex than that jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think we would really evaluate at that point with our investment committee what made sense where we saw the most value so we dont have anything that wed say oh were necessarily going to replace the treasury with the treasury were going to see where we think theres more value most value in the market brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it thats all i have for questions thank you very much jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator operator instructions the next question is coming from jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good afternoon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just a few random ones here on the credit question phil or jerry what should we expect on nonperformers i know these two kind of feel like random and very different credits but what do you guys see in terms of stress in the portfolio and do we maybe its obvious but do we just expect it to continue to rise phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc jon i think realistically it will some of these were watching a lot of credits and weve got good eyes on everything and if rates stay up and higher longer i think well see some more nonperformers and in real estate but do i think theres much loss there no i dont and we might get lucky and avoid some of them but theres just some properties that are under stress and im a ph cross banker and so im going to take a conservative view and i think nonperformers will increase but theyre so low right now its really hard for them to for us to expect them to be at the same level going through a cycle like this indefinitely so i mean im not trying to paint a bleak picture im just trying to be realistic and were going to have to be patient as we work with these customers the main thing you want to see is people doing the right thing that youve banked and working with you and on restructuring deals doing their part to contribute to make it right and weve got some deals that were seeing that theyre going to need that and were having conversations with that and im expecting everyone to perform the way they should and i think itll be fine and but realistically not everyone is going to do what you want them to do and i dont have any specific expectations there except ive just been in this business a long time and some of thats going to happen that to me is not the big worry right now its to me look and i dont want you think we dont have all eyes on credit we do i mean but to me thats going to work its way out ive got faith in the underwriting and the relationships that weve been doing for the last few years again it doesnt matter what you do today really what matters is what youve done over the last few years and ive got a lot of faith in that the thing that i want to see us continuing to do is win competitively we are winning competitively and im really excited about the opportunity in austin i think its got every chance to be as good as weve seen in other places and well see but thats what were focused on is growing the business and winning competitively will we see some nonperformers increase i bet we will jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay yeah it kind of reminds me of energy seven or eight years ago in some ways phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc the jerry for you the houston you talked about a eps impact so call it of eps maybe crude math but of footings how long does it take houston to reach like corporate wide profitability in returns cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc let me see if i can grab my put my hands on some of that information what was interesting is that and phil and i really havent talked about this but for the quarter it was interesting that how well houston paid their debt now at this point theyre starting to pay for more of the expansion its kind of what we had been talking about when all this started was the plan was to make them to make profitable so they could start paying for some of those and id say so what we said was it takes about months to breakeven is kind of what we kind of project and so at this point i think that houston is probably a couple of years away just from the standpoint that remember early on its all expense loaded and so at this point its still going to be a couple of years before houston is contributing its not the size of but weve got some of that same expense front loading jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and just on for it to reach call it similar returns and profitability profile of the rest of the company is that a year away jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think thats probably right wed kind of have to take a little bit closer look at it sharpen our pencil but yeah i dont think its too far from that again i dont have in front of me what their projections are for the rest of the year but like we said they had a ph linked quarter core growth on deposits with that sort of a growth horizon we wouldnt be too far but i have to be honest i dont have that sort of a projection in front of me and happy to be able to talk about it at some future point when we get together phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc jon its an interesting question the just kind of overall as we look at these branches and we ph pro forma it out we tend to use it when we began all this a fiveyear horizon for the branch to kind of reach maturity and that was i guess that would be similar profitability to what we were overall but honestly its also true we dont talk a lot about it but its also true that in years through i think weve seen really more growth than we see in that first five years as those things mature we see some really significant growth so i think ultimately these locations end up with better profitability than the total profitability of the company just because theyre more efficient and more focused on a book of business in a defined market and a defined structure so i think that were not at five years for all of them and itll take a little bit even for to get there but and then certainly is going to take some time before all of those or fiveyear mature but dont count out continued growth in those markets from the expansion with year through historically as you looked at those branches that we had done before we started the expansion some of the growth in years through was really significant jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah thats really where the power is cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah okay yeah so were just kind of just getting there jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost
