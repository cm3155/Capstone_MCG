quarter results for cullenfrost and our cfo jerry salinas will provide additional comments and then were going to open it up for your questions as a normal practice in the first quarter cullenfrost earned million or a per share compared with earnings of a million or a a share reported in the same quarter last year and million or a share in the fourth quarter of our return on average assets and average common equity in the first quarter were basis points and respectively and im happy with these results to start the year and im optimistic about the prospects for our sustainable organic growth strategy as business activity continues to return to normal and we move farther into a rising interest rate environment average deposits in the first quarter were billion that was an increase of more than compared with billion in the first quarter of last year this is outstanding growth and jerry will talk more about this growth in his comments but i believe at its core it reflects our commitment to strong value propositions centered around worldclass customer service investments into our business for both physical expansion and employee compensation and account features and also a commitment to a square deal with our customers which is the basis of any healthy longterm relationship loan growth was also outstanding average loans excluding ppp in the first quarter were billion or ahead of the same time last year on a linked quarter basis we saw average loans excluding ppp increase over the fourth quarter and unannualized helping support our expectations for full year average loan growth in cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 the highsingle digits im very pleased with the success of our commercial lending segment we booked billion in new commitments in the first quarter up from new loan commitments in the first quarter of last year the gains were strong in all segments new commitments booked in the first quarter tend to be seasonally lower than the fourth quarter and that was true this first quarter as well as we saw first quarter commitments down from our record monster fourth quarter level however our gross new loan opportunities at the end of the first quarter were up by compared to the fourth quarter and our weighted pipeline at the end of the first quarter increased by from the fourth quarter and all this is to say that the outlook for loan growth continues to be good a few other things i found interesting about our lending activity in the first quarter compared to a year ago we looked at more deals but we booked more deals that improvement was driven by the ci component which went from booking rate last year to a in the first quarter so were having more success were seeing more activity from customers as they begin expanding their businesses so we of course would expect a higher success rate there our advance rate on commercial working capital lines increased from at year end to at the end of the first quarter still below a more normalized to level new customer acquisition continues to be key our numbers show that of our linkedquarter growth in outstanding loan balances came from customers added over the last months our expansion efforts are becoming more accretive to growth as an example our yearoveryear loan growth of would have been without the expansion volume our consumer business continues to be strong in the first quarter total consumer checking households grew over compared to last year which aligns with the record growth we saw in samestore sales for checking accounts increased consumer deposits grew nearly billion in the quarter giving us a yearoveryear increase and loan demand has picked up on the consumer side helping us grow loan balances by a little over yearoveryear and helping to set the stage for the launch of our mortgage product later this year we believe our value proposition is resonating and we can continue to grow this business especially in our expansion markets in houston we see the momentum continuing to build as the newly opened branches there mature at the end of the first quarter we stood at of our deposit goal of our new household goal and of our loan goal and weve had a very successful start toward dallas region expansion as well for the two locations that opened so far this year along with the red bird financial center that opened in our numbers are early but they do represent of deposit goal of loan goal and of our household goal despite the macroeconomic challenges we continue to be optimistic about growth in this economy the third new location in our branch dallas expansion project is scheduled to open in second quarter additionally we will continue to expand in houston adding another eight locations over the course of and credit continues to be good total problem loans which we define as risk grade and higher totaled million at the end of the first quarter down from million at the end of the previous quarter during the first quarter newly identified outstanding problem loans totaled million during the average addition to problem loans was about million the increase during the first quarter was one of the smallest in several years the resolution of problems via payoffs payments and upgrades in the first quarter totaled million the short story here is that the favorable rate of resolutions continued through the first quarter of the march total for delinquency was the lowest in several years once again we did not report a credit loss expense in the first quarter and our net chargeoffs for the first quarter were million and those compared with million in the fourth quarter annualized net chargeoffs for the first quarter were basis points of average loans and below our typical longterm level nonaccrual loans were only million at the end of the first quarter a decrease from million at the end of the fourth quarter last year in the first quarter we continued making progress toward our goal of a midsingle digit concentration level in the energy portfolio over cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 time with energy loans representing of loans at the end of the quarter and over the last months energy loans are down by after two years of working with business customers on ppp loans were almost across the finish line with forgiveness complete for of our borrowers putting in the extra effort to help ppp borrowers wasnt easy but it was the right thing to do and the same goes for our decision late last year to raise our minimum pay to an hour then in the first quarter after the federal reserve increased interest rates we made the decision to pass some of that increase along to our depositors again it wasnt easy and it wasnt inexpensive but it was the right thing to do for our customers steps like these show our commitment to our communities and being a force for good in peoples everyday lives and thats reflected in the thirdparty recognition that frost receives we learned in the first quarter that once again and for the sixth year in a row wed received the highest number of greenwich excellence and best brand awards of any bank in the nation the greenwich awards are given for providing superior service advice and performance to small business and middle market banking clients also earlier this month we learned that once again at this time it was the 13th year in a row we received the highest ranking and customer satisfaction for jd power us retail banking satisfaction study for texas over the past few years weve talked to you about all the steps weve taken to enhance our value proposition and our competitive advantage things like organic expansion projects overdraft grace early payday states biggest atm network keep in mind this growth has taken place during the pandemic when many of our employees were working remotely and while our financial centers were taking extraordinary measures to keep people safe i say this a lot but i cant say it often enough im so proud of our company and our employees and everything weve accomplished together knowing what our team can do is what makes me so optimistic about frosts success in the future now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil looking first at our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the first quarter was up basis points from the reported last quarter excluding the impact of ppp loans our net interest margin percentage would have been in the first quarter up basis points from an adjusted for the fourth quarter the increase was a result of some positive items partially offset by some items with a negative impact a lower relative percentage of earning assets held at the fed down from in the fourth quarter to in the first quarter as we deployed some liquidity into our investment portfolio had the largest positive impact higher volumes of securities and loans also had a positive impact on the net interest margin percentage while lower yields on securities and loans had a negative impact the taxable equivalent loan yield for the first quarter was down basis points from the previous quarter excluding the impact of ppp loans the taxable equivalent loan yield would have been down basis points from the prior quarter and just to finish up on ppp as phil talked about our total ppp loans at the end of march were only million down million from million at the end of december as such we dont expect ppp to have any material impact on our results looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the first quarter up about billion from the fourth quarter average as we continue to deploy some of our excess liquidity during the first quarter we made investment purchases during the quarter of approximately billion which included about billion in agency mbs securities with a yield of about and about billion in treasuries yielding about included in the billion in treasury securities purchased in the first quarter is a billion purchase of twoyear treasuries that we purchased in latejanuary with a yield of we purchased those cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 short duration treasuries as a defensive measure given the uncertainty in the market resulting from the potential invasion at that time of ukraine by russia and its potential market implications in addition to the billion in purchases we made in the investment portfolio in the first quarter our current expectation is that we would invest an additional billion of our excess liquidity into investment purchases through the remainder of the year the taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio was in the first quarter down basis points from the fourth quarter the yield on the taxable portfolio which averaged billion and was up billion from the prior quarter was up basis points from the fourth quarter our tax exempt municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the first quarter down about million from the fourth quarter with a taxable equivalent yield of up basis points from the prior quarter at the end of the first quarter of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psfinsured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the first quarter was years up from years at the end of the fourth quarter primarily related to the extended duration on lower coupon mortgagebacked securities average deposits for the quarter were billion up billion or from the first quarter last year the growth in noninterestbearing deposits was up billion or while interestbearing deposits grew billion or looking at a 12month look back of deposit growth about of our growth over the past year has come from new relationships on a linkedquarter basis deposits are up billion or on a non annualized basis in the linkedquarter comparison the growth has come primarily from growth in interestbearing deposits the cost of interestbearing deposits in the first quarter was basis points up basis point from the previous quarter looking at a couple of linkedquarter income statement comparisons in noninterest income regarding insurance commissions and fees all point out to the strong lean quarter growth of million or just as a reminder the first quarter is always our strongest quarter for insurance commissions and fees due to our natural business cycle of higher renewals in that quarter and also the impact of contingent commissions that are typically received in the first quarter ill also note that typically the second quarter is our weakest quarter for insurance commissions looking at linkedquarter total noninterest expenses ill note that the first quarter total expenses were right in line with our projections from one quarter ago however given the continued increase in salary pressures in this current environment i am increasing our expectation for noninterest expense growth for the full year last quarter i stated that we expected total noninterest expense for to grow at a highsingle digit growth rate over reported noninterest expense given recent activity primarily related to higher than previously projected increases in salary levels given the competition for talent in this environment we now expect total noninterest expenses for the full year to increase at a percentage rate in the lowdouble digits over reported levels in addition to continued market salary pressures our projected growth in noninterest expenses is also impacted by our expansion efforts the impact of our houston and dallas expansions is responsible for about of the growth costs associated with reintroducing our residential mortgage product adds about and increasing our minimum wage from per hour to per hour in december as a result of salary pressures across the state is responsible for about of projected growth in noninterest expenses in looking at our effective tax rate the effective tax rate for the first quarter was and our current expectation is that our full year effective tax rate should be in the range of to but that can be affected by discrete items during the year regarding the estimates for full year earnings our current projections assumed basis point fed rate increases in both may and june followed by basis point fed rate increases in september cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 and december with those rate assumptions and the expected expense growth that i previously mentioned we currently believe that the current mean of analysts estimates of for is low with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc all right thank you jerry okay well open it up for questions now question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question has come from the line of michael rose with raymond james please proceed with your questions michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning or good afternoon guys how are you phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc good michael jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc great thank you michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc good so it looks like the amount of securities that youre going to repurchase is clearly higher than i think the billion that you talked about last quarter obviously the rate hikes appear to be coming a little bit more intense and a little faster than expected can you just talk about maybe what outside of that maybe is driving that decision or is that kind of it just higher rates quicker and things like that jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc well i guess one of the things that i did point out was the billion dollars and shortterm the two year treasuries that we purchased in january that was really something that we did more as a defensive measure it really wasnt part of our original plan given that short duration itll be back investable in a couple of years here and so i kind of took that billion id say the billion was just an addition again given what was going on in the current environment at that time and really deposits have been a little bit stronger than we expected i think i mentioned in last quarters call that given some of the past history that we had i thought the first quarter deposits might be a little bit softer but theyve continued to perform well i know that when we had the call a quarter ago our balances at the fed were billion i looked this morning and were at billion so that gives you a good feel that we cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 spent quite a bit already and yet we still have a significant amount of liquidity so thats a long winded way of answering your question hope i gave you what you needed michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc yeah yeah perfect thank you so much and then the loan growth this quarter obviously very strong looks like you guys are really hitting the stride here but you reiterated the outlook for growth for the year to me it seems a little conservative can you just kind of walk through kind of the puts and takes so i dont know probably broadly speaking theres some concern on the economy as we move into the back half of the year but clearly texas if you look at the moodys expectations for growth over the next couple of years for texas it looks very strong so if you can just talk about the puts and takes to that outlook thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey michael first of all youre right we do expect it to be and we do see the outlook is really good weve got a good pipeline as i mentioned which is the opportunity is up from the quarter end at the end of the year we are seeing some pay downs or hearing about possibilities of pay downs in the commercial real estate side as people are concerned about higher cap rates i dont think weve seen much movement in cap rates yet but theres concern there obviously youve seen some higher interest rates so i think there could be some of that but thats probably the biggest headwind and then also we have been continuing to watch our energy portfolio and were almost down to where that midsingle digit number is i really want to get a five handle on that and i think probably with good chance sometime during this quarter i guess the second quarter to get there but were still being real careful with that so thats a bit of a headwind and thats what i would say would be the things that would make it more conservative but i feel more confident about the highsingle digits number that we had talked about earlier this year michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc great thanks for taking all my questions phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc youre welcome operator thank you our next questions come from the line of brady gailey with kbw please proceed with your questions brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good afternoon guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc good afternoon brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc well i heard the comments in your prepared remarks about how you guys have already passed along some of the fed increase to your depositors i remember you guys doing this the last tightening cycle as well but how much of the initial basis points did you pass along and then how are you thinking about that as we head into the fed continuing to aggressively hike rates from here jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah brady so the first hike i think that we were about if you look at interestbearing id say in the beta in that first hike i think as we look through the rest of the year and again i guess i should start by saying youve always heard us talking about the fact that were going to do what we need to do from a market standpoint so these are current assumptions based on what we saw back in the im going to say the time period of the im going to go to what we were doing there and if you recall we were a little slow i think as an industry we waited an hour and we waited until rate had gone up basis points before we moved materially and we said we didnt want to do that this time so for that first hike were at about a im going to say looking at kind of where were going from here is that wed probably be talking something closer to a beta on them and let me read my notes here just to make sure that im giving you the right information but again i think what we want to do is we want to make sure that were consistent with where the markets going to be at that point hold on here all right so really were looking at on the interestbearing side were looking at something pretty consistent with that what we did in the first quarter so allin im looking through the rest most of the hikes that we have for this year wed be at about a beta on interestbearing overall when i go back and looked at what we did between and its pretty comparable to that so again well see what the market does but thats what weve got in our current expectations right now brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right and then this is i think your fifth or sixth consecutive quarter of having a zero provision yeah the reserve is still roughly basis points could it be years until we see a number in that provision line like you still have indiscernible reserves seems like you can bleed down that percentage as you book loan growth and there just doesnt appear to be much provision need for indiscernible is that the right way to think about it jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc you know what i would say is that if you look at our disclosures in the 10ks and the 10qs weve been pretty descriptive of what were doing and what were finding is that from our standpoint the models really truly arent reflective of what we see out there and so from our analysis youll see that a significant part of the reserve need is based on overlays to those models this quarter given some of the considerations and concerns about a potential recession even that sort of a discussion was really what was tainting what was going on in our minds as we finalized our allowance calculation i guess what id say is when i look at our projected loan growth that phil kind of quoted there i look at the credit quality that weve got and knock on wood bill perotti our chief credit cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 officer keep saying it cant be any better but it continues to be really good and so as i look at projected loan growth if theres not a whole lot of changes in the environment that were operating in i think that having a provision at no provision or minimal provision is kind of probably where wed id be thinking for the full year but theres a lot of ifs out there but again everything looks so good loan growth is its at a highsingle digits in my mind isnt unreasonable phil was talking about loan growth or something like that id be answering that question differently but basically looking at where our projections are the sort of asset quality we have what were seeing in the outlook from a projection standpoint again its going to all come down to what the models say and what our analysis says at the end of each quarter but where i sit right now its hard as you said looking back for the last few quarters and not seeing a whole lot of provision yeah its kind of hard to figure that thered be much of a provision going forward through the next couple of quarters all things being equal brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks for the color operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your questions ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon i just wanted to followup on loan growth and just in terms of the outlook maybe phil i guess when you think about the back half of the year the concern obviously is fed hikes and what implications it carries for customers both businesses and consumers and their ability to absorb that just talk to us as you deal with your customers and what youre hearing from them in terms of what a fed fund at means is it enough to really hurt demand and potentially push the economy into a recession would love to hear your thoughts phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc ebrahim were not seeing a lot of impact at this point we are doing a lot with our officers to really sensitize them about the impact that inflation can have on businesses some of us older guys we know what its like back when volcker was doing his thing shutting things down but most people id say most lenders in the financial services industry havent been through a period of any meaningful inflation and so were doing our job to help our people understand how to contact and ask questions and understand the impact that inflation could have on a business and for us to understand that that said we havent seen that impact to this point i think that the most direct impact would probably be in the commercial real estate just in terms of viability of projects we havent seen a big impact on that at this point but if you look at actual real rates i think are still pretty negative so feds got a way to go given inflation and other things to tighten things up and slow things down so right now im not seeing too much of it except as it relates to worry in the commercial real estate area ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess one question for you jerry im sorry if i missed it but remind us in terms of your outlook for deposit growth from your just do you expect any outflows as rates move higher i know you talked about just the deposit betas and your thought process there but what do you think about deposit growth and any cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 perspective you can share in what you think spread revenue growth could look like given the rate assumptions that you outlined earlier jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure yeah we did if you look at our numbers we can see that commercial dda is softer its still growing but its not growing at the pace that weve seen to me i think thats still a positive ill say back in the previous cycle we really didnt see a whole lot of movement for the first basis points im going to say that were much more aware and much more sensitive to whats going on and certainly try to be as reactive as we can i think that deposits i think were still projecting growth i dont think wed be foolish to project a growth yearoveryear although i probably said that last year when we still had but i do think that our current projections based on what were seeing with the growth that were getting from new customers and the success that weve had with our expansion i still expect that well see some upside this year i dont expect that itll be in the double digits but i think that weve got a good opportunity to be at least highsingle digit deposit growth as we move forward and were going to be competitive on rates as youve heard us say ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and any sense on what spread revenue growth could look like jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think we talked a little bit about in the quarter last years quarter that on a te basis full year growth i think itd be in the higher than the midteens but not sort of range is kind of what im thinking given on our current assumptions with the rate hikes obviously the december hike doesnt do much for us at all but you know i think thats kind of what were seeing right now obviously we dont have the only thing i guess id want to be sensitive to is that let me make sure that ppp was such a big piece of our financials we did such a our team did such a great job in getting those ppp loans booked and now forgiven but now i think im pretty comfortable with that number itd be something some at least based on our current projections and our current betas itd be something north of the midteens does that help ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thats helpful no thats very helpful and thanks for taking my questions jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator thank you our next questions come from the line of jennifer demba with truist securities please proceed with your question jennifer you really check if youre on mute jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 yeah good afternoon hi how are you just wondering if you could talk to us about what youre thinking in terms of future branch expansion after do you think you could go back and do more in houston and dallas before proceed on to austin any thoughts there phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc you know jennifer i think well be well probably have a little bit left to do in dallas on follow on in so well do some of that and we could just like we had houston where we came back with about another third of the new locations for new branches there we could see some expansion in dallas three years from now i really believe this is going to be an ongoing activity for us as we develop these markets like houston and dallas and i keep saying the thing that its so amazing about those two markets is each one of them is larger in deposits than either the state of arizona or the state of colorado so these are massive markets just another thing thats i think thats interesting if you look at our farthest northwest location houston to our farther as southeast i think its the same distances between san antonio and austin so thats a big city obviously austin has got some opportunity there and i think that well be looking at that over time but jennifer one thing that it might seem like a little deal to you but this is something i saw just yesterday that i am really excited about and this is a branch location that we opened in san antonio now its in a good growth market that we really hadnt been in for various reasons its on the west side of san antonio its called alamo ranch and that branch opened around thanksgiving okay so its been open about four months a lot of those months really bad months for banking in terms of opening up accounts but looking at those numbers in four months weve got million in deposits and we have new relationships in four months this is a market weve got market share let me put that in perspective ill say well tell me what was the best branch we had in houston and we said well its got to be cinco ranch in katy in terms of speed of growth so ill compare that to cinco ranch and cinco ranch after four months had million in deposits in comparison to million of san antonio location it had households compared to in san antonio i mean what that tells me is that man you picked the right markets with the right brand recognition with our value proposition and our ways of engaging that market were going to be successful and look its not because we hired mr alamo ranch in terms of new to the market brought all the business as i recall the person we hired to run it is from kansas city so man this was really encouraging and i think its instructive for us about the value of putting properly placed properly managed new locations around the state so i really believe this jennifer that the best two words i can say about our organic growth strategy is that it is durable and its scalable i really believe that were going to be doing this for a long time jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you so much helpful phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc welcome operator thank you our next questions come from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey steve jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc jerry i was hoping you could help out with this so if we look at the yield that you called out on the taxable and tax exempt securities as the interest rates rise can you help us think about a securities beta if you will or how responsive should those be im assuming its probably threeyear to fiveyear part of the curve we should be looking at for both of those indiscernible for the munis but how responsive if you look at cash flows coming off due reinvestment rates how should we think about those resetting as interest rates move higher jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc well let me help you a little bit with kind of what were thinking about with the billion that i said we still have to purchase and youre right i mean right now what were thinking is that about of that is going to be in treasuries and were thinking that it would be five years and shorter is what were doing and so that really only leaves another in mortgage backs and another in munis i guess if you looked at the fiveyear today were at ph i think we were this morning i mean im trying to look here what weve got rolling off i think that the kind of comparison i would make is more the fact that because were really increasing the portfolio from the standpoint of using our excess liquidity is really not a significant year for our projected muni calls or maturities and so i think mostly the what well be doing is well be reinvesting primarily out of our excess liquidity so in a lot of ways whatever assumption you make on what were investing is going to be a pretty significant hiccup now if i look at kind of some of the calls im trying to see if i got some of that information here with me for the first quarter we really didnt have a whole lot coming off i think we had just million and most of those tended to be munis and i think the blended rate there was a as i look at kind of what were going to see through the rest of the year i dont see any really significant maturities that i would feel that we would want to call out i mean i think our current projections for example august and february are the big calls on our muni portfolios and both of those are less than theyre in the million to million in each of those time periods so from a maturities if you include prepayments in there again i mean were just not im looking at a 12month forward so i got a little bit of and a little bit of included here but its only a billion and thats combined both maturities and prepayments so in a lot of ways i think a lot of its going to be good upside that were picking up investing out of balances that are at the fed steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 yeah jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc now i think if we put anything on its going to be especially in the near term its probably going to be if you are replacing security its going to be at a lower yield in todays environment steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc against what weve got on the books steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah okay and then so if we looked at all of the liquidity youre sitting on today do they get to a certain point like okay like we can go back to where we used to be in terms of cash to assets ratio which was i guess about a third of where you are now or is there some reason that from structure where youd need to hold more liquidity than in the past jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i dont think so theres a in some ways i would argue that we have more access to funding if we needed it than weve in the past so no i dont see any sort of structural reason that we want to invest what youll see us doing as we go through the rest of and what i would expect through is a much more averaging sort of a dollar dollar cost averaging if you will purchases were going to try to avoid making any significant purchases now if for some reason we saw something really unusual happen in the market might we jump in and do something we might but i think right now what were projecting is that were projecting that its going to be a were expecting rates are going to go up and so were just going to continue to over the next year for the rest of the year lets say for the next nine months were just going to make some ratable purchases each month expecting that were never going to be able to time the market exactly but if we kind of make purchases during the remaining months were going to catch some good bounces there and we may miss one like we did in the case of the twoyear that we bought at steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc so were just going to average it in and i would expect thats what we would do as we get into to a lot of its going to be dependent on what happens with deposits right weve been really fortunate like i said when we look at the balances at the fed were making a lot of investment purchases but at the same time that balance doesnt really seem to move a lot so weve been fortunate there and obviously if that continues we might find cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 ourselves in a position where wed be willing to invest more but were not looking to invest all our dry powder in steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then the final one going back to ebrahims question on deposit growth loantodeposit ratio is fairly low but youve always new markets and initiatives really driving those deposit growth should we think the loanto deposit ratio could stay fairly stable at these levels or should we be thinking that loan growth is faster than deposit growth so that trends lower say through thanks jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc you know i think that and ill let phil give us thoughts on it the challenge is that weve got such a big base of deposits and weve been so fortunate to be able to grow that base with the top quality service that our employees are providing the fair pricing that were giving and so when deposits are more than twice the size of our loan book if theyre growing at that even if they grew at and the loans grew at the highsingle digit its going to be a while before we make a significant dent on that ratio and we certainly love deposits we love the relationships that come with them we think that a lot of our success is based on our core funding so thats my thoughts so ill turn to phil phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think that the math of it is going to be were going to have a low loantodeposit ratio for some time but id also say that thats a high class problem and i think the more important thing is the company growing right and so i think itll take a while to eat into that ratio the other thing ill say about growing deposits is we have such a high level of transaction accounts because of our relational business model like i think it will probably i dont know maybe almost twothirds or transaction accounts if you look at consumer checking accounts and commercial checking accounts at any kind of normalization of interest rates lets say a fed funds rate for example i mean the spread that you make on those deposits being in liquidity is what you might make on some old libor based loans i mean theyre nothing to sneeze at some point when your interest rates are moving so im feeling very very comfortable about the fact that yeah were probably going to have a fairly low loan to deposit ratio or certainly lower than peer for a pretty good period of time steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc you bet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 thanks good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc steve alexopoulos is a smart guy that was the question i had for you but i do have a couple others just phil you usually give us some color on the competitive environment in terms of loans that you passed on due to structure and pricing could you just give us a foot view on what the environments like phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc i think the environment gets a little bit worse every quarter i think that it continues to show up in commercial real estate where people are struggling to underwrite in a market where prices are increasing so fast and where most of us have these sensitized analyses that okay well will your project cash flow x percent based upon x percent interest rate those are harder to justify theyre harder to underwrite its hard to underwrite well how much rent growth are you willing to underwrite into deals okay thats an important factor when prices are going up like they are i think people are asking for longerterms at the front end and theyre looking for ways to extend what really not much required of them and thats i mean im not telling you anything you dont know i mean all this stuff is just whats out there in the marketplace i think some people are were seeing maybe a little bit of a trend to people underwriting to a debt yield and whereas you might have underwritten to a debt yield maybe theyre backing off that number maybe youd seen number i think theres just creativity being utilized by underwriters in the market to justify and bring deals across the line im sure thats not exhaustive but its just an example of some of the things were seeing jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay got it question on your mortgage expectations just i dont know a couple of quarters ago you talked about it and it just seem like more of a rifle shot approach but i was just thinking of your alamo ranch example and some of the consumer checking account growth that youre seeing any change in the expectations there and kind of what are your expectations for the mortgage contribution jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think you make an excellent point jon i mean its one of the things were talking about i mean just take that example i think our loans theyre like i dont know a million which is not bad in four months and you look at what is in this case it is a more consumeroriented more of a house style location whereas we typically tend to go to a more where youve got a lot more concentration of businesses and such in a more wheelhouse but i think that the addition of the mortgage product into our product mix into some of these markets like this one here cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 and therere tons of these i think around the state it makes it more viable from generation of assets and so i think it helps us netnet in terms of the viability of locations that we can go into and remember were not approaching this as a refinance strategy on mortgages we are looking to do deals where your their purchased money mortgage is and where we can provide great service and help customers with a significant financial transaction in their lives so i think were going to have to see were not going to be offering our first one until later this year like id say fourth quarter sometime but im really optimistic on the quality experience were going to give and how successful were going to be with that asset class over time and i just cant wait to get after this market no in a prudent way of course but get after this market with that customer experience i think its going to be great jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay yeah i just think through that as its maybe one solution your loantodeposit question and if youd portfolio some of this and youve seen some peer banks do that as well but phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc i think its jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc clearly yeah phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thats fair point fair point jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc and it is our plan currently that we would portfolio those mortgages jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay just last one nonquantitative but how do you think the frost brand resonates with new residents is this market share youre taking from other banks and taxes from existing people or do you feel like the brand resonates with somebody we hear about people moving from california to texas is that part of this growth as well thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i cant tell you that i have definitive information on what our penetration is for californians or people from illinois or in the texas heres what i think though our growth numbers have been so good say on the consumer side that i think that were having good success i mean the way most people shop our research says youre going to go into a market you might just stay with your own look your own old bank but youre going to cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 still look to see where the nearest branch location is that our research shows thats still the number one factor someone considers and then youre going to look online at what kind of reputation and those kind of things and youre going to do your research and if you do that i mean our numbers were just going to be in the game in fact obviously with our customer service numbers i think that well be ahead of the pack most of the time and theres so much inmigration into these cities and our growth is good that it just tells me that i think what were doing resonates with a fair number of people that are moving in and the thing is were of a size we dont have to get everyone we just got to get our share plus on that and well do really well jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah okay thanks guys i appreciate it phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc all right jon operator thank you operator instructions our next questions come from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed with your question bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good afternoon phil and jerry i just wanted to follow up on some of your comments around the deposit franchise and the strength of the deposit base and in particular some have raised the concept of surge deposits and the possibility that there could be some outflow as the fed starts to drain liquidity from the system it sounds like you think your deposits are sticky and thats not something that youre worried about but perhaps if you could just frame how you think about that and lastly if i could squeeze in you mentioned that consensus eps looks low but i was hoping you could perhaps share your thoughts on what you think about consensus net interest income growth expectations does that also look like its perhaps a bit late i would appreciate your thoughts thank you phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thank you well ill just say that with regard to deposits and what the levels are i mean i think what youre hearing us and what youre hearing jerry say is were careful and conservative we expect these growth rates are going to slow weve been growing at for gosh i think the last two years and we think theyll slow do we still see augmentation in our deposit balances as opposed to new customers yeah probably what is it jerry about augmentations what jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 yeah so call it twothirds of our growth is augmentation right now based on the last quarter third from new customers we could see some drop and if we see diminishment of account balances we could see some drop on that but my gut tells me and we saw this back in whenever the fed reacted to the tech bubble and pushed rates down too low you could see deposits flatten but i think once they do they probably reach what ill call dynamic equilibrium where youve got maybe deposit balance for current customers diminishing but youre still bringing on that account growth that were showing and what were reporting on weve got these expansions so i tend to think it would be more of a flattening than an absolute reduction of surge deposits as you call but hope is not a plan and ill tell you that one part of the reason we have that billion in liquidity there is because you provide for those kinds of eventualities so we are prepared regardless of which way it goes ill let jerry speak to the margin jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think the number that i see out there that ab is sharing with me is billion billion something like that is kind of where it looks like consensus to that and ill go back to and what i dont know is whether thats a te number or not i will say that if its a te number the guidance i gave would infer a higher number than that one is concerned if i look at trying to see if ive got the nonte number yeah even if its a nonte number id say that yeah i mean its in the ballpark of little what i would say maybe a little shy of where were at but again im just thats im going off billion number our projections obviously on a te basis is much higher than that on a nonte basis still higher but were certainly within the range bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc super helpful thank you for taking my question phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dave rochester with compass point please proceed with your question david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys just back on the nii discussion appreciate the update there and your thoughts that you just talked about in terms of what youre seeing versus consensus i guess when i take a step back and you talked about maybe things should be a little bit stronger than your prior guide which is midteens back in january you guys were only factoring in 25basispoint hike in may july and december and now were talking basis points and basis points in alone it just seems like the updated guide is still conservative especially just given the message on deposit betas as well which i think improved from your prior thoughts in january as well so it just seems like is it a case of maybe youre factoring in a little conservative admin here or it feels like plus might be more in the ballpark of what youre looking at any updated thoughts there jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 yeah i think that part of the discussion is going to be the betas that come in especially on the hikes after hopefully this may hike i think thats some of it i think also the assumption what gets assumed on investment purchases going forward right and the timing of those i think a lot of its just going to be dependent on timing and what assumptions you make on the rates that well be purchasing at on the investment securities david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc because thats going to be a big part of the driver here we are probably a little conservative on deposit betas as well we want to ensure that we do what we say were going to do which is make sure that we are competitive in the marketplace against all the peers not just the too big to fail so i think there is probably some of that as well david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc theres going to be therell be some pressure on loan pricing as well i mean we did see a drop on a linked quarter as well so well feel some of that as well but i mean i think ive given you about all the color that i can give you and i think a lot of its just going to be dependent on your assumptions david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah i appreciate that and the billion in securities purchases you were talking about thats purchases not growth right so youre expecting maybe another billion or billion in securities growth for the rest of the year is that fair jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah thatd be fair david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah so that billion is just purchases david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 got you all right maybe if i can just sneak in one more i was just curious to you guys gave some pretty positive color on the percentage of your goals that youre achieving in houston dallas so just curious because houstons been around for a while now can you just update us on what the loantodeposit balances look like in terms of dollars thatd be great thanks guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc okay give us a sec and one thing ill say about dallas that even though its early its running about twothirds commercial on the deposit side onethird consumer so i think its uncanny how the character of the business that were generating in the dallas market is consistent with houston jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah and so looking at the loantodeposit ratio you were asking for the expansion thats running about a right now david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc well in terms of the dollar amounts of loans and deposits you have in houston jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc right of just the expansion branches is all im sharing with you kind of what weve david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc oh okay jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc been able to accomplish there is that what youre asking david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc well i was just curious how much in the way of loans and deposits you have in houston now jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure sure david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc and thats cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure yeah so we had deposits of million call it and loans of a little bit shy of million david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc all right great thanks guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator thank you our next questions come from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your question peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks ph i hate to beat this to a dead horse this net interest income if i could try it one more time jerry the guidance that you gave north of midteens is that on a reported basis of or does not exclude ppp income jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no thats so the guidance im giving is te net interest income full year just reported over full year and youre right does include quite a bit more ppp than weve got so im saying that wed have a little bit north of midteen growth is what were projecting currently over the reported peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc on a reported basis got it jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yes peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thats helpful and then overdraft and nsf fees have become a hot topic for the banks and youve seen a number of banks indiscernible im just curious what your thoughts are on overdraft nsf fees and how much that is on a quarterly basis for you guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure the things that were talking about now is we implemented i think phil may have mentioned in his comments overdraft grace in april i think it was of last year which basically cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2022 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc allows customers that have at least in direct deposit to be able to incur a overdraft with no fee the current conversation that were having is that we would expand that to include all consumer customers so even if you didnt have a direct deposit and that probably cost us about million a year when we pull that trigger which will be sometime later this year peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks jerry phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc i think the other thing peter is we continue to monitor that program and just weve been doing it for years i think the other thing thats becoming mainstream is elimination of whats called nsf fees and yeah were in the middle of working towards that its just a systems programming issue which youve got to put in place and i expect us to have that done in the next few months and jerry indiscernible jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah thats probably somewhere around to a quarter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc but all those are considered in my guidance operator thank you there are no further questions at this time id like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments phillip d green chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc all right well we thank you for the questions today and for everybodys interest
