first quarter cullenfrost earned million or per share compared with earnings of million or a a share reported in the same quarter last year in a very challenging environment in which our bank lobbies are closed more than twothirds of our employees are working remotely our team continues to serve our customers at a very high level that frost is known for and to execute our strategy of pursuing consistent above average organic growth in the first quarter our return on average assets was compared to in the first quarter of last year average deposits in the first quarter were billion up from billion in the first quarter of last year and average loans in the first quarter were up to billion from billion in the first quarter of last year our credit loss expense was million for the first quarter and that compared to million in the fourth quarter of and million in the first quarter of in addition to the changes related to cecl our credit loss expense was elevated in the first quarter as a result of covid19 related business closures and also challenges faced by our energy industry customers due to recent commodity price declines net chargeoffs for the first quarter were million compared with million in the fourth quarter of and million in the first quarter of last year annualized net chargeoffs for the first quarter were of average loans nonperforming assets were million at the end of the first quarter down from million at year end most of this decline came from chargeoffs related to two energy credits weve been dealing with for some time as they move through the snake towards resolution overall delinquencies for accrued loans at the end of the first quarter were million or basis points of period end loans those numbers remain within our standards and comparable to what weve experienced in the past several years so the problem loans which we define as risk grade and higher were million at the end of the first quarter compared to million in the previous quarter energyrelated problem loans were million at the end of the first quarter compared to million for the previous quarter and million in the first quarter of last year energy loans in general represented of our portfolio at the end of the first quarter well below our peak of more than in and down from in the fourth quarter of clearly we enter the current downturn from a position of strength but were not confused the deterioration of the economy brought on by covid19s pandemic will have a negative but manageable effect on our portfolio were in the early stages of this downturn which is unprecedented in our lifetime we dont know the link we dont know the ultimate resolution we dont know the impact of massive financial and fiscal stimulus bought to bear on the problem but we do know that it will address these issues consistent with our culture and core values that have guided us in multiple crises over our 152year history and while we dont have all the answers and outcomes id like to share a few data points we hope will be helpful weve identified seven portfolio segments eight including energy that we feel have higher than usual risk to the current economic dislocations brought on by the pandemic they include restaurants hotels aviation entertainment and sports retail religious organizations and associations and organizations the total of these cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 portfolio of segments represents billion at the end of the first quarter there were million in the deferrals related to this portfolio at quarter end the reserve for loan losses against these segments at the end of the quarter was looking at energy this portfolio totaled billion at quarter end and carried a loan loss reserve of reservebased borrowers represented of the quarter end total significantly influencing our energy reserve number was an oil price scenario of per barrel for the remainder of this assumption was combined with borrowers plans to manage through the current cycle hedge positions cost structures debt levels other secondary sources of repayment and other factors a similar analysis was performed on nonreservebased borrowers of the production portfolio is hedged in and in both hit prices in the mid the average breakeven for the portfolio is per barrel our focus on commercial loans continues to be on consistent balanced growth including both the core component which we define as lending relationships under million in size as well as larger relationships while maintaining our quality standards regarding new loan commitments booked the balance between these relationships went from for larger and core at the end of to larger and core so far in the movement towards larger loans yeartodate was mostly due to two large public finance transactions new relationships were off to a strong start in the first part of the quarter but were negatively affected in february and march by the covid19 pandemic resulting in a decline of compared with the first quarter of last year the dollar amount of new loan commitments booked during the first quarter rose by compared to the prior year we continue to look at many deals and in the first quarter we booked more loan commitments from opportunities compared with the same quarter last year in cre we saw the market become more liberal in terms of structure our percentage of deals lost to structure increased from this time last year to in the first quarter of this year our weighted current active loan pipeline in the first quarter was down about compared with the end of the fourth quarter due to the effects of the pandemic on the consumer banking side we continue to see solid growth in deposits and loans overall net new consumer customer growth for the first quarter was up from a year ago samestore sales as measured by account openings were down by through the end of the first quarter in the first quarter of our account openings came from the online channel which includes our frost bank mobile app online account openings were higher compared to the first quarter of the consumer loan portfolio averaged billion in the first quarter increasing about compared to the first quarter last year overall frost bankers have risen to the unique challenges presented by the pandemic and its resulting shutdowns with a mix of keeping our standards and sticking to our strategies along with a truly remarkable amount of flexibility and adaptability we opened the 11th of our planned new financial centers in the houston region in the first quarter and we have two more openings scheduled for may even if lobbies remain closed through the new branches scheduled openings one of the new locations has a motor bank and will begin serving customers on day one we continue to hire talented experienced bankers as part of our houston expansion and weve already filled more than of the approximately positions expected ill talk more in a minute about our efforts around the paycheck protection program but i wanted to note that during the first round of funding this important small business program frost was number one in the houston market in terms of the number of ppp loans it got approved in harris county weve helped nearly businesses get loans for million and that shows our strong commitment to the houston market and cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 reinforces our strategy of bringing our value proposition to more customers there later in the first quarter we began offering programs to assist our customers similar to the disaster loans and other relief efforts that we implemented after hurricane harvey and frost announced that it would donate million to nonprofit agencies assisting with pandemic relief in the areas where we have operations just before the quarter ended congress passed the cares act which included provisions for billion in small business loans through the paycheck protection program or ppp we knew that frost small business customers would benefit greatly from ppp loans so even as we closed our lobbies and set up our employees to work remotely to protect them and our customers we mobilized for the ppp application process even though the sba finalized this application with only hours to spare we were ready to begin processing on day one and the demand was tremendous we received more than applications in just the first four days in comparison we process about commercial loans in a typical year but we dug in and the frost bankers adapted with technologies and they developed systems on the go and through lots of hard work and many long hours we wrestled ppp to the ground the initial funding was set up to last two months but it was exhausted in less than two weeks before that happened frost received ppp applications for a total of billion and because of the dedication and commitment and effort of thousands of frost bankers more of our small business customers or more than threequarters of those applying received sba funding in the first round for billion or of the amount requested based on our size we projected wed be fortunate to receive approval on about million instead we were able to secure more than times that amount that billion represents continued paychecks for workers and employers that have been affected by the pandemic through this process our small business customers learn the true value of having a relationship with frost every quarter when we share our financial information and talk about the great work that frost bankers do in executing our strategies while taking care of customers this time i can say that ive never been prouder of the work our people do on behalf of our customers i hope our shareholders have this same sense of pride knowing their company is truly a source of strength for our customers and our communities and also a force for good in their lives its what makes me optimistic that well get past the many challenges that remain our credit teams have reached out to borrowers in our industries that are most affected by the pandemic we continue to work very closely with both commercial and consumer customers were keeping a close eye on the recent anomalies in oil prices and the impact that thats having on the economy well follow our best practices and public health guidelines as we formulate plans to return to our offices and reopen our lobbies our commitment to customer service was confirmed this month when frost received the highest ranking in customer satisfaction in texas in jd powers us retail banking satisfaction study for the 11th consecutive year we sometimes take these achievements for granted or consider them routine the events of the past few months should stand as a reminder that theres nothing routine about frost and its culture now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil today im going to skip our usual comments about the texas economy given the level of economic uncertainty in the shortterm there wouldnt be much value in a macro comment at this time i will point out that it has been reported that businesses in texas received more ppp loans than businesses in any other state and were proud to have been a leading participant in that program as phil mentioned in his remarks making approximately billion in loans over a remarkably short period of time we are now involved with the second tranche of that program and we continue to assist our customers during this challenging time cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 now ill turn to our financial performance in the first quarter looking at our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the first quarter was down basis points from the reported last quarter the decrease primarily resulted from lower yield on loans and balances at the fed as well as an increase in the proportion of balances at the fed as a percentage of earning assets partially offset by lower funding costs the taxable equivalent loan yield for the first quarter was down basis points from the fourth quarter impacted by the lower rate environment with the march fed rate cuts and decreases in libor during the quarter looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the first quarter down about million from the fourth quarter average of billion the taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was in the first quarter up basis points from the fourth quarter our municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the first quarter up about million from the fourth quarter the municipal portfolio had a taxable equivalent yield for the first quarter of down basis point from the previous quarter and at the end of the first quarter about twothirds of that municipal portfolio was psfinsured as we mentioned last quarter during the fourth quarter we purchased million in 30year treasury securities yielding and to hedge against falling interest rates during the first quarter given the volatility in the yield curve we decided to monetize the gain associated with those treasuries and sold them resulting in a pretax gain of approximately million the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the first quarter was years down from years last quarter and was impacted by the sale of those 30year treasuries our current plan does not include any material investment security purchases through the remainder of the year looking at our funding sources the cost of total deposits for the first quarter was basis points down basis points from the fourth quarter the cost of combined fed funds purchase and repurchase agreements which consists primarily of customer repos decreased basis points to for the first quarter from in the previous quarter those balances averaged about billion during the first quarter down about million from the previous quarter during the first quarter we did redeem our million in preferred stock resulting in the recognition of million in debt issuance costs which reduced net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter and results in the elimination of that million quarterly dividend going forward looking at our credit loss expense the components of our total credit loss expense consisted primarily of million for the energy portfolio million for the commercial real estate portfolio and million for the ci portfolio our energy reserve coverage at the end of the first quarter was moving on to noninterest expense total noninterest expense for the quarter increased approximately million or compared to the first quarter last year excluding the impact of the houston expansion and the operating cost associated with our headquarters move in downtown san antonio noninterest expense growth would have been approximately we are withdrawing our previous earnings guidance and will not be providing any eps guidance for full year at this time given the uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the pandemic including the potential impact of future expected credit loss expense i will say that given the fed rate cuts in march and the continuing decline in libor rates we do expect our net interest income and net interest margin percentage to decrease from their first quarter level we will see a positive from the impact of the ppp loans but given the shortterm nature of those loans we expect that benefit to be relatively shortterm as the fees associated with those loans will be earned into interest income over the life of those loans cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 during our call last quarter we did provide guidance around projected expense growth for over during these uncertain times we continue to focus on managing expenses including looking for ways to operate more efficiently as a result we currently expect that noninterest expense in will grow at about over thats about lower than our previous guidance with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you jerry okay well open it up for questions now question and answer section operator great operator instructions your first question comes from the line of brady gailey of kbw your line is open brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thank you good morning guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so if you look at period end loan balances you had some strong growth in the first quarter can you expand on what drove that and how youre looking about loan growth for the rest of the year excluding the p3 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah let me see are you looking at period end or are you looking at average numbers brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i was talking about period end loans which grew about phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc period end cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah brady we did from a linked quarter basis yeah we did have a pretty significant growth we grew on period end so about annualized a big portion of that growth if you annualize it was related to our ci portfolio that was up almost just actual growth and if you annualize that almost and we did see some increases in commercial lines that were drawn on during the quarter and especially during that time period leading us to march period end we have seen some of that begin to subside the pace of those draws and im going to say that was the bulk of the increase there we actually had a decrease in energy between december and march they were down million phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc we also had some nice gains in the public finance area with some large deals one related to a port in the state a very large one the other one was related to a medical center a large medical center hvac so both of those things were also positives brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and then when you look at the sbas ppp so you had billion in round one how much do you expect to do in round two and where does that fee come in i think most banks are saying thats around would that be a fair estimate for frost phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc it is our fee is running about that i think it ended up maybe being a tad lower in the first round but i think were seeing a little bit smaller balance in the second and so i think itll make it solidly in the as far as volumes a couple things are happening one is we are making sure that we get through the best we can the applications that were not processed in the first round so our backlog there was somewhere between and applications i cant remember the exact number right now and so were working on those as we look at the second round of applications which we may be at the point of processing those now as of late last night we may have started that weve seen a little bit lower volume we received about applications as i recall this event ended yesterday with loan balances as i said being a little bit on the smaller side so still good activity but not the huge rush that was there at the beginning because i think a lot of larger customers more sophisticated customers had more visibility just in terms of their awareness of the program so we saw a large rush in the beginning as far as where were booking the assets go into interest income brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful and then finally for me you mentioned of the energy production is hedged in this year next year can you say those percentages are as a percent of the total production or those are the percentages of your energy customers that just have some level of hedging phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah those are the customers that have some level of hedging cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you brady operator your next question comes from the line of ken zerbe of morgan stanley your line is open ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks good morning jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just kind have maybe a multipart question a little bit can you just talk a little bit more about the increase in net chargeoffs in the quarter but also layer in how much of that related to energy and certainly whether how much of the energy reserve bill is related to specific reserves versus just sort of normal cecl reserves if that makes sense phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well first of all the chargeoffs for the quarter were heavily related to energy there was as i recall million related to two credits who were nonperforming and we describe those as been moving through the snake really for a couple years now or even longer and were written down to values which at the time were based upon deals that were on the table in one case and bankruptcy in another which there has been offer related to honestly as were seen the covid19 pandemic impact and the reduction in volumes and demand usage for a while i think those values are certainly at risk so thats really what that relates to and both of those two credits now i think a combined amount of million and so were closely getting out of the snake but it didnt quite move through in time for the pandemic jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc just to clarify there our total was million for the quarter and million of that was energyrelated as phil mentioned phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thanks jerry million million is the total cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then in terms of specific energy reserve build versus more general cecl phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc we didnt book any specific energy reserves jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thats correct phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc im going to let jerry speak to the cecl aspect of it which will include some overlays and few factors jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah so what we did was our team ended up using the moodys baseline forecast that was adjusted around the middle of march that took west texas intermediate down to flat for three years in that scenario i think it was called the s8 scenario and then what happened was that moodys continued to reduce that given what was going on in the global economy if you will between russia and saudi arabia and so we were and a pandemic started coming in and so we decided that what we would do is we would use really more overlay than adjust or update the usage of a zero point moodys model if you will so our energy reserves that we created were primarily related to overlays rather than specific reserves and we can kind of talk a little bit if you like about the work that weve done there but thats what increased the reserves it was not so much specific as much as more macro sort of overlaytype stress test that weve done phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc and as they update their models to be more reflective of the situation with energy and the pandemic we can see maybe a reduction of overlays in jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc exactly that would be our expectation and just to give you a little bit of insight and all of this is in our 10q and well file this here this morning but the stress testing that weve done on the energy portfolio assumed per barrel during and then we did create a sort of i guess they call it an energy oversight council that became that was created towards the end of march and they review the credit portfolio of all our major energy credits and so that group was very involved with what was done and so they took the decision to go ahead and run those stress tests assuming in and then increasing to in in and thereafter and that work that was done was what created the overlay and i think the overlay in the energy portfolio was included a few factors in the overlays it was like million and still the expectation for us is that during the next quarter if you will when the cecl models are rerun we would expect that we would use more updated model inputs and our expectation currently is that a big portion of that overlay would be moved into more modeltype results but well have to see what the model thats kind of what happened during this first quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc makes sense and then just one followup i think you said you brought your energy as a percentage of total loans from down to of total loans just kind of how did you bring it down so much in the quarter and where do you envision this going over the next few quarters phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think we had a little bit of an anomaly in the previous quarter its gone from basically to i think it just came down to a more normalized level based upon activity if there was any one thing we have been working to reduce the exposure of the energy portfolio and well continue to do so getting it below the level id like to see it move more towards the midsingle digits over time but that takes time to do because youve got credit agreements in place that youve got to move through and what other charges and timing on all that were still going to be in the business as we said were going to be there with the best customers in periods like this we call it pruning the hedge and were going to continue to do that so were working hard to continue to rationalize our exposure down to more in line with some of the other significant components of the loan portfolio jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc and of course as phil mentioned earlier we did have almost million in chargeoffs phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah we did jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc that are going to affect that percentage also phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc its true ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc understood all right thank you very much phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of dave rochester of compass point your line is open david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 hey good morning guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey on the energy book definitely appreciate all the color you gave there and sorry if i missed this but was just wondering if you could give some background on how far along you are in the redetermination process and what youre seeing in terms of how much lines are declining for customers and what utilization is at this point phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc okay were about id say about a third through the redetermination process it happens at this time of year and what weve been seeing thus far is about a reduction in valuations david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc so the actual lines to customers have only come in phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thats a reduction in the valuations i dont know that weve been working to reduce that over and above the re determination process as jerry mentioned the energy council that weve put in place where were talking with customers making sure we understand what their operating plans are what their expense reductions are cash flow etcetera weve been pretty successful even before maturities at getting some line reduction so i dont want to say it all relates to the redeterminations but because it has been just working with customers as well as far as we could look i guess on commitment levels and we see what the difference is there but i dont have at hand right now what the reduction is in that but we can look over on the call david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then how does that inform the reserve for the quarter do you sort of extrapolate results from that one third onto the twothirds remaining that youre still working on and then you set the reserve that way or are we going to see that incremental reserve flow into for the additional twothirds youre working on now jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc well remember some of what we did in this first stage of cecl on the overlay was really based on a stress test that had it based on oil for the year and i think that really at that point is where they use the reserve level before the redetermination cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay got it and then for the two energy credits you talked about chargingoff what was the severity on those phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc in what way what do you mean severity david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc in terms of the book value which you had in march what was the percentage charge that you ultimately took to resolve those phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc those its pretty big on those weve got somewhere around here the original amount but theyre charged down i would say its at least three quarters on those those are jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc these are some of the credits i think phil may have said that are making their way through the snake phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah they were put in place jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah theyve had some pretty significant chargeoffs associated with them phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah as a rule of thumb as i used to report it its not our finest hour for sure david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then just backing up to the total loan book level could you just give a deferral amount again on the higher risk bucket that you mentioned the combined billion i think it was that you mentioned and then what was the total deferral percentage for the entire loan book at this point phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc okay well the deferrals for the higher risk bucket and this is not including energy wouldve been and this was added at the end of lets say april million cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc of the billion outstanding and if you look at the deferrals for the entire company jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc theyre about billion phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc about billion jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc its about of our loans david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and maybe just one last one on the nim in i know is when youll get that full quarter impact of the rate cuts you talked about the trend there being down was just wondering if you could sort of bracket that in terms of rough range or estimate in terms of magnitude of what youre expecting for that would be great jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think the only color i can give there really is i dont think any of us really completely understands how the ppp loans will affect net interest margin how quickly thatll be repaid some of our conversations internally we talk about potentially of them maybe getting paid within say the first weeks but thats really just us trying to figure out how all this will work i mean if we had some challenges obviously with some of the input getting into the system theres no secret there i know theres a lot of credit associated with that so we dont fully understand yet how all thats going to play out as we move forward but that would be a big assuming that it worked out that way obviously youd have a significant hit there from a positive standpoint david rochester a analyst compass point research trading llc yeah any way to just estimate backing that out because youre absolutely right i mean thats going to be some noise into and maybe even too depending on when these things are forgiven or whatever happens with those so maybe just backing that impact out any sense just from a magnitude perspective jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 yeah i would tell you that if you back them out and again i think that our net interest margin we were at i think that full year well still be north of is what our current projection is but youre going to see some drag especially between the first and the second after that its still levels out a little bit but youre going to see some significant reductions in the nim again were not making any investment assumptions of course theres nothing really to buy right now were really trying to make sure that we keep our liquidity as high as we can and we have not borrowed from the federal reserve under their liquidity program so yeah theres going to be obviously some pressure on the nim and especially with libor going down as much as it has here recently it was kind of nice to have it at higher levels but its moving down pretty quickly now david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay all right thanks guys appreciate it phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jennifer demba of suntrust your line is open jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you good morning phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning jenny jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc so you mentioned your billion of loans in more vulnerable categories phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc right jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc of those categories what are the larger exposures within that billion phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well let me just give you what the the segmenting for you if you look at the category for religion through public finance outstandings at the end of the quarter were approximately million restaurants total there outstandings million hotels million aviation million if you look at the public finance area youre looking at associations and organizations with million entertainment and sports were million and retail cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 businesses not the investor of real estate but the retail businesses were about million so thats the breakdown in those categories jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc are any of those sba loans or phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc we have some but not a lot of them i mean our portfolio of sbas if i remember it right its in the ph million range so are you talking about ppp loans jennifer or are you talking about traditional sba loans jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc no regular phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc regular sba if you give me a minute i might be able to pull that i couldve seen that somewhere its not a big factor jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay okay and ive seen the hotels are mainly limited service type properties phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc some are our hotel exposure is committed i gave you outstanding committed is million weve got projects weve got eight of them in construction and the construction ones will be finished sometime this year remains to be seen when theyre going to open weve got average loan to value on those properties is so our owners are experienced theyve got a lot of equity in the projects good operators a lot of hilton and marriott flags no gateway cities nothing related to cruise ships or theme parks or those kinds of things four of the projects that weve actually closed is million of commitments thats actually closed from operations just gone dark on because theyve seen indiscernible levels get down to such low levels so actually we feel really good about the portfolio i think were going to have some risk grade increases in our problems which means you have increasing risk but really dont feel at this point we see any loss in that portfolio good sponsors many of which have good liquidity jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc how does the restaurant book look like though phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc restaurants our commitments there sorry indiscernible we analyze mainly all commitments about million commitments million of them have asked for deferrals at this point twothirds of that portfolio cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 of committed dollars are associated with multiple format restaurants multiple sites like franchisees with obviously lots of locations i think the exposure there jennifer probably relates to the small restaurant that maybe isnt as used to dealing with a takeout format id say maybe borrowers that have less than where you dont have a lot of value in the collateral associated with it its not a big number its about million for small restaurants that are loans less than obviously they add up a bit but i think right now thats where we see the exposure the hard thing about all this is that the numbers that were working with really are from third quarter year end we dont have audit reports for a lot of the companies and even if you did i mean the numbers look good for everything so what were doing is were just having to analyze where we are and use our experience just to estimate where these things are going to show up so when i tell you the restaurants we think its under and the portfolio is million thats true its our best guess of where well see it but the fact is we just dont know right were still waiting to see the impact jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks so much good color phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc welcome operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey i had a different topic but i just wanted to followup one on jennifers questions looks like you had some downgrades in terms of problem loans outside of energy just curious about that and maybe can you touch on maybe broadness and frequency of your loan grading process phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think that as we saw new problem loans it was some of the larger ones public financerelated organizations that maybe in the arts or the education area we saw some downgrades everything can be fine but we saw that id say energy is the main area where we did see the increases in what we call problem loans which are grade and higher as for the grading process i mean our officers are responsible to have the grades and make sure theyre accurate we really want to avoid any double downgrades and then we measure that out as we measure individual relationship manager performance so theyre responsible for keeping up with it and i didnt really notice anything that gave me much pause in the nonenergy migration to the downgrades that cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 we saw i think i may have somewhere around here jerry do you have the nonenergy indiscernible jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i have to look for them give me a little bit of time here phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah okay so jon excuse me were having to pull that out jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc we can come back to that just on ppp curious why you think you were able to secure times what you expected and also wondering if youd take a stab at how much of that 3plus or billion is maybe people that are new to frost customers that are new to frost phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well first of all our position was that we would deal frost customers so you didnt have to be a borrower but you did need to be a commercial customer when it started out and the reason for that wasnt it was all based upon what was the fastest way to get money into the community because if we were dealing with noncustomers we would have to go through the federal governments regulations on bsa aml know your customer and we really didnt have any slack we didnt cut any slack for anyone that im aware of in that area and so the fastest way to process the applications was to do it with people that wed already known through that process with and thats the first thing as it relates to that the second thing id say regarding how we were able to do it as effectively as we did its just as ive said before its just terrific people and an outstanding culture that has a culture of going above and beyond we had over volunteers and people that didnt do anything like this in their regular job and wanted to be a part of the process and inputs applications at night from home everyone is doing this stuff from home but not just application inputting i mean the completion rate accurate completion rate of the applications that comes in im really surprised that it was and so a tremendous amount of work had to go into contacting the customer getting information that might have been missing some cases we had suspicion that they had filled it out wrong based upon how theyve given the answers on the questionnaire so weve spent a lot of time talking to customers and getting those applications ready and so being able to get or so of the applications through i think was just amazing because i guarantee you we didnt get completed inputready applications and so there was tremendous amount of working from home at late hours around the clock weve been doing this seven days a week we took the easter sunday off and its just been the grit just grit of our people i really think that what ive seen not just us but other community banks and other banks i mean everyone is trying their best but its just its unprecedented its historic and truly really its heroic what weve seen and im just amazed at the success weve had jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay ill leave it at that thanks guys cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc jon just one thing i was going to say ive got the information for you but its really broken down by risk grade and by commercial loan class and so i have go through all the numbers but were going to file our q right after this and itll be on page itll be the current year by class and by risk grade of the current year on the next page on page will be the december information with the new cecl disclosure we just dont have i dont have a comparison to give to you one versus the other jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay that helps thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi steven jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc to start just a followup on an energy question what were the problem loan balances at the end of the first quarter i think it was million last quarter and then what specific deferrals did you provide to energy companies in the quarter phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc okay problem loans wouldve been at the end of the first quarter million and the previous as you said they were million at the end of the previous quarter so a decline in risk grade of round numbers about and an increase in the risk grade looks like about id say or so so we had a little migration there we talked as far as that we talked about credit for the last two quarters that was really dependent upon asset sales in order to like the business plan work and they were fighting the issue that discount rates had gone so high with the absence of equity in the business and private equity moving out of the market you added that on top of that whats going on with this demand destruction of covid19 so youve got just discount rates being high but also prices being low so we saw some deterioration in that relationship so that i mean most of that that i just described so thats i think those are the most cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah on energy deferrals weve not seen really a whole lot at all a pretty de minimis amount of energy customers have asked for deferrals steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay thats helpful and then thank you on the expense outlook being taken down for is that or how much of that is related to the houston expansion is that being slowed at all can you give some color there phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah the its not related to the houston expansion its just were being careful on people that were hiring were reducing expenses really in all categories just trying to be smart about it as we do lose people and we see were losing people for various reasons and were just asking the question do we need to replace that position i think were just were doing a good job there were continuing on with the houston expansion weve been investing in that for the last couple years i feel good about whats going on with regard to that we were looking at it seems like ancient history now given everything is either ppp or covid19 but im really excited about the performance weve had in houston if you look at our new household goal and where we are versus it were ahead of our new household goal and by the way thats what i look at mostly to get to that one gets taken care of it just takes care of everything else were of our loan goal for our houston expansion at this point in time our deposits are of our goal but it has been improving for example if you look over the last three months were of our goal for deposits and thats really because of the commercial side the consumer side is actually over the last three months of our goal and so the commercial side takes longer to develop where you can move a relationship over but it takes a while for that operating business to really end up in your numbers as they move and mature so were about of our goal over the last three months in commercial but im not worried about that thats our wheelhouse and im expecting that to go up and as we mentioned the business journal houston business journal reported that we were the number one ppp lender in that market from any bank including very large banks the community banks and i think thats getting around in the marketplace people are learning the value of a relationship i had one customer mention that they didnt realize when they decided to open a checking account years ago if they would be making a decision on whether their business will stay in business or not because they were able to get a ppp on through a company that they have a positive relationship with so im excited about the houston expansion im excited about the performance that weve had and it is its a tough market to do that in but this is a very strategic very longterm effort for us that were showing success and not only success because we knew that if we could just meet our pro forma goals this could be great but in my mind were exceeding that and im extremely happy about it im looking forward to getting past this pandemic situation and getting back to a more normalized environment i think were really going to be able to trade off of our value proposition in that marketplace jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes and how many branches did you open at this point in houston and how many are left cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc remaining or opened phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc remaining we were open in so we have remaining jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc remaining okay thanks so much for the color phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc youre welcome operator your next question comes from the line of matt olney of stephens your line is open matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey good morning and thanks for taking my question phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi matt matt olney q analyst stephens inc most of my questions have been addressed but phil you mentioned the banks intention to reduce the energy exposure over time to the midsingledigit level and it sounds like this could take a while but can you talk more about the driver of that decision was it made at the board level and does this speak to the risk profile of the asset class that isnt as favorable as it once was or does it speak more to the volatility of the stock price just trying to understand the driver of this decision thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah no it wasnt made at the board level ive been talking about this but keep in mind when i first started talking about this we were at going to probably and so we stopped the growth we made a decision to move it down we said we wanted to be between and i think and obviously move it down to ive said in previous calls that id like to see a single digit handle on that and one of the things as you refer to im just came up on the finance side im a big believer in asset allocation right just pick any business and you can cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 pick the best stock in an industry segment thats not doing well and youre not going to do well even if you pick the best stock and so i think our shareholders sign up for less volatility with a company like ours and if you looked at the correlation of our stock price to the energy prices we had the highest correlation of stock price to the price of oil of any of our peers and i just dont think that our shareholders sign up for that kind of volatility im a big shareholder i wont sign up for that kind of volatility with a company like ours and so i think this makes sense that what we needed to be doing was not just throw in the longhaul around energy but just like doing the ground game youve been talking about for a long time now the core loans it was under million and also making sure that were doing what our culture what we say we do around underwriting making sure that were really being conservative around all of our portfolios but including the energy portfolio so weve been moving that way weve been talking over the last year about moving it down to the singledigit levels as i have sort of referred in previous calls and i think that theres the next largest portfolio segment for our company is probably around or in terms of its size i dont think theres any reason for the energy portfolio to be any larger than the next largest segment of our portfolio i just think its a common sense view of what it represents for us and it really puts the onus on us to make sure that were doing the hard work of growing the rest of the business as well ill just say even if that level reduced level itll be a significant portfolio for us but with less exposure than we have had historically and its an important business for the state and itll be something i think that were good at and well continue to do but we have been trying to and we are ready to reduce that exposure over time but as i said its not something you can do laterally it has to be done in a smart way over time and in accordance with the lending agreements that youve got in place and maintaining the great relationships that we have with a great number of great customers that we have today matt olney q analyst stephens inc perfect thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala of bank of america securities your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc good morning guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning eb ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc most of my questions have been asked and answered just a couple of followups and then phil you previously talked about obviously the organic expansion in houston and your interest there in a world where there is some market dislocations and some ma opportunities come up can you talk to in terms of your interest level and like is there something like a distressed situation would you think about ma in the current environment or are you still rather go back to the organic growth that we were doing pre this crisis cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah ebrahim i think that were still focused on the organic growth for all the reasons that we have been asked a lot of that around brand a lot of that around operational exposure i think the pandemic introduced us some other variables as well around credit that type of thing but i mean at the core its still that strategic decision that weve been able to create a brand that shown and demonstrated its ability to grow organically and we just think its the best deal for our shareholders who have let us build the company with a brand like that to be able to prosecute even it though it does take some operational burn in the buildout period but its a winning longterm strategy and one that we really like to see the benefits of it go to the current shareholders that allowed us to build that brand as opposed to paying other companies that might dilute that it continues to be our focus ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc understood and then just one followup in terms of you gave out a lot of numbers around the energy book i think i heard you say that you assumed in oil prices for this year and next year is it reasonable to take that and assume that if oil prices are higher like the power prices for next year above that mid30 your portfolio is well reserved for based on this test and analysis that you performed phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc did you say did you assume that yeah next year if its in the low well see some were believing well see some increased demand i think one thing that youre seeing also with the disruption of production in the us one thing that we have to keep an eye on is are we going to see such a reduction over the next to months that we see price movements up so i think they tend to not be small movements just small changes and the swing of volumes up or down tend to make fairly large price changes so were expecting to see some resumption of usage and burn of current inventory and thats why weve got the million for next year jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc million is our phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc million ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc million okay got it thank you phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of michael rose of raymond james your line is open cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey thanks for taking my questions phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey michael michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc just two followups looks like the total potential problem loans were up million looks like about million or of that was energyrelated what made up the other component of it and how much of it was in that higher risk category that you mentioned phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i believe that the largest increase the biggest increase that we saw there was the problem was the credit that i mentioned earlier and had mentioned for the last couple of quarters indiscernible reliant on sales of property and as i mentioned when equity dried up in the market and you saw discount rates increase it made anybody needing to sell properties was under some stress and would be under stress and we saw that and then as we saw prices go down so not only our discount rates will have a price prices are low it really has hurt what was the operating model that credit had so and that as ive mentioned before that one its about million of exposure michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then just one additional question on capital you guys were really strong during the great financial crisis and actually continued to increase your dividend can you just give us some updated thoughts on the dividend and how youre thinking about buybacks at this point thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah michael i think at this point our focus will be around the dividend and the importance of that as opposed to buybacks i think youre going to see us lean towards the dividend as opposed to the buyback i think were going to jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think weve got million left on a program thats authorized i think it expires in july weve made the decision were not going to do any buybacks under that program michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc and any additional ones yes
