ill review fourth quarter results for cullenfrost and our chief financial officer jerry salinas will provide additional comments before we open it up for your questions in the fourth quarter cullenfrost earned million or per share compared with earnings of million or a share reported in the same quarter last year now these results were affected by a million onetime fdic insurance surcharge associated with the bank failures that happened early in our return on assets and common equity for the fourth quarter were basis points and respectively and that compares with and for the same quarter same period last year for full year the companys annual net income available to common shareholders was million thats an increase of compared to earnings available to common shareholders of million on a per share basis full year earnings were a share compared to a share reported in as we mentioned in this mornings press release adjust for the onetime fdic insurance surcharge our yearly earnings would have been up by approximately over the solid fourth quarter and full year performance is due to the continued strong execution of our organic growth strategy by frost bankers who provide our customers with topquality service and experiences that make peoples lives better cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 our balance sheet and our liquidity levels remain consistently strong frost remains very wellcapitalized and has a loantodeposit ratio also as was the case in previous quarters cullenfrost did not take on any home loan advances participated in any special liquidity facility or government borrowing access any broker deposits or utilize any reciprocal deposit arrangements to build insured deposit percentages and additionally our available for sale securities portfolio represented more than of our portfolio total at quarterend our average deposits grew in the fourth quarter to billion up an annualized from the billion in the previous quarter average loans also grew in the fourth quarter to billion compared with billion in the third quarter that was an annualized increase of we continue to see excellent results from our organic growth program for example our original houston expansion locations stand at of original deposit goal loan goal and of our new household goal for what we call our houston locations the last of which will open this year we stand at of deposit goal of loan goal and of new household goal as of quarterend the expansion loans and deposits represented approximately and respectively of our total houston market presence for the dallas market expansion we stand at of deposit goal of loan goal and of our new household goal while still relatively early in this effort expansion loans represent approximately and deposits represented approximately of dallas market totals weve opened up almost twothirds of our planned locations in the dallas market and we look forward to their growth as these locations mature past at the startup phase and were also excited about our new austin expansion effort where we plan to open locations to double our presence in that market as weve mentioned before and the first of those opened in and the next is scheduled to open in april keep in mind that weve been successful generating core stable grassroots business in our expansions and that will generate significant value over the long term at yearend our overall expansion efforts had generated billion in deposits and billion in loans even though many of these locations are still early in their development looking at our consumer banking business we continue to see outstanding organic growth and we ended with a record net new household growth of households again thats net growth and its higher than last years net household growth in the past three years weve added net new consumer checking households thats times more than the three years before that and that shows that our organic growth strategy combined with our customer experience and reputation is key to our success we have the right products and services and relationships to help customers in our markets also as weve noted were excited about the prospects for our new mortgage product we completed the product rollout in december to the last of our regions which was the houston region and in the fourth quarter we approached the milestone of originating our first mortgages and we expect faster growth in looking at our commercial business our weighted pipeline is at billion and that was down from the record that we set billion in the third quarter in the fourth quarter we brought in new relationships thats the third highest quarterly amount ever up an unannualized over the third quarter and up over the fourth quarter last year this shows me that our success in growing our business organically includes not only a consumer but also commercial business as well cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 for the full year new commercial relationships added million in new loan balances and million in new deposits credit quality continues to be good by historical standards with nonaccrual loans down from the previous quarter and net chargeoffs at healthy levels problem loans which we define as risk grade or higher totaled million at the end of the fourth quarter that was up from the million at the end of the second quarter and million this time last year this growth in the fourth quarter was evenly split between loans in the oaem and classified categories another way of saying risk grade and risk grade categories nonperforming assets totaled million at the end of the fourth quarter compared with million last quarter and million a year ago the yearend figure represents just basis points of period end loans and basis points of total assets net chargeoffs for the fourth quarter were million compared to million last quarter and million a year ago annualized net chargeoffs for the fourth quarter represent basis points of average loans and full year chargeoffs were basis points of loans regarding commercial real estate lending our overall portfolio remained stable with steady operating performance across all asset types and acceptable debt service coverage ratios and loan to values within this portfolio what we would consider to be the major categories of investor cre that is office multifamily retail and industrial as examples total billion or of total cre loans outstanding our investor cre portfolio has held up well with the average performance metrics slightly improved quarter over quarter exhibiting an overall average loan to value of about and weighted average debt service coverage ratio of about the investor office portfolio in particular had a balance of million at quarter end which was down from million the prior quarter that portfolio exhibited an average loan to value of and an average debt service coverage ratio of and healthy occupancy levels all of which improved from the prior quarter our comfort level with our office portfolio continues to be based on the character and expertise and experience of our borrowers and sponsors as well as with the predominantly class a nature of our office building projects and again were glad to be operating in texas more than of our office portfolio projects were in frost markets which are texas major metropolitan areas we continue to see good economic growth and strong levels of in migration of both people and businesses i also wanted to note that from september to december total investor office outstandings decreased from the linked quarter and total commitments decreased by finally ill point out that weve just rolled out a new frost marketing campaign and brand refresh designed to emphasize the great customer experiences we provide in order to differentiate our voice in a crowded banking marketplace weve been talking for some time about the need to invest in marketing capabilities to complement the organic success weve been achieving and were optimistic about the impact this will make in customer acquisition so in closing we remain optimistic for what lies ahead and were capitalizing on opportunities were enhancing and expanding our brand and im proud of everything that our frost teams are accomplishing across our communities and now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 thank you phil let me start off by giving some additional color on our houston expansion results as phil mentioned weve been very pleased with the volumes weve been able to achieve looking at the fourth quarter linked quarter growth in average loans and deposits were million and million respectively each representing approximately annualized growth and for the fourth quarter houston contributed to our quarterly earnings per share now moving to our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the fourth quarter was down basis points from the reported last quarter some positives for the quarter included higher yields and volumes of both loans and balances at the fed these positives were primarily offset by higher costs and volumes of deposits and customer repos compared to the third quarter looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the fourth quarter down million from the third quarter during the quarter we did not make any material investment purchases the net unrealized loss on the available for sale portfolio at the end of the quarter was billion a decrease of million from the billion reported at the end of the third quarter the taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio in the fourth quarter was flat with the third quarter the taxable portfolio which averaged billion down approximately million from the prior quarter had a yield of down basis point from the prior quarter our tax exempt municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the fourth quarter down about million from the third quarter and had a taxable equivalent yield of flat with the prior quarter at the end of the fourth quarter approximately of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psf insured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter was years down from years at the end of the third quarter looking at deposits on a linked quarter basis average deposits of billion were up million or on an annualized basis from the previous quarter we did continue to see a mix shift during the quarter as average noninterestbearing demand deposits decreased million or while interest bearing deposits increased million or when compared to the previous quarter based on the fourth quarter average balances noninterest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits were compared to in the third quarter looking at january monthtodate averages for total deposits through yesterday they are basically flat with our fourth quarter average of billion for january monthtodate through yesterday the average noninterest bearing deposit balance was billion down million from the fourth quarter average affected by seasonality as those deposits tend to peak in the fourth quarter and soften in the first half of the year for january monthtodate average interest bearing deposits through yesterday were billion up million from our fourth quarter average in the january monthtodate average we do continue to see a shift in the mix in interestbearing deposits to higher cost cds from lower cost products the cost of interestbearing deposits in the fourth quarter was up basis points from in the third quarter customer repos for the fourth quarter averaged billion up million from the billion average in the third quarter the cost of customer repos for the quarter was up basis points from the third quarter the monthtodate january average for customer repos was basically flat with the fourth quarter looking at noninterest income and expense on a linked quarter basis ill just point out a couple of items the other noninterest income category included a million recovery of a fraud related loss accrual that we recognized in the fourth quarter last year salaries and wages included approximately million in higher stock compensation compared to the third quarter as a reminder our stock awards are granted in october of each year and some awards by their nature require immediate expense recognition cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 the other noninterest expense category included a donation to our frost charitable foundation of million regarding estimates for fullyear our current projections include five basis point cuts for the fed funds rate over the course of for the full year of we currently expect full year average loan growth in the mid to highsingle digits fullyear average deposit growth in the range of to net interest income growth in the range of to with the net interest margin percentage expected to be slightly higher for fullyear than the we reported for noninterest income could be relatively flat given the pressure facing the industry on interchange revenues and odnsf fees noninterest expense growth in the range of to on a reported basis regarding net charge offs we do expect those to go up in to a more normalized historical level of basis points to basis points of average loans given the unusually low level weve seen in the last few years regarding taxes our effective tax rate for the full year of was and we currently expect a comparable effective tax rate in going forward given the wide range of analysts estimates and the resultant impact on the mean of estimates we do not plan to comment on consensus eps as we have in the past and will instead provide our outlook for the major building blocks of our profitability with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you jerry now well open up the call for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question is from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please proceed ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch hey good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch i guess maybe first question for jerry your outlook with the five rate cuts for nii growth you mentioned about to just give us a sense of the sensitivity my understanding is the balance sheet is still asset sensitive so first whether thats right or wrong and then as the year progresses do you expect nii to just lower or do we build from fourth quarter levels and are you just outrunning rate cut impact because of balance sheet growth and fixed rate assets repricing cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thats a lot let me first say that yes we still are asset sensitive i think weve talked about this in the past ill just kind of go through some of the pieces of it and fill in as i can remember your question but one of the upsides that we talked about was that weve got projected about million in proceeds from our investment portfolio and about billion billion remember correctly is in the first quarter so a big chunk of it comes in and the yields that that portfolio has i think weve talked in the past about some specific treasury securities that we had purchased i think million of that is going to mature here this month and the yield on that portfolio was little ph i think it was so some of what were seeing is a pickup that were going to get just from the even if we dont reinvest in investment securities even in that rate environment that weve discussed it would still be favorable to our net interest margin percentage weve also seen some improvements i was noting in our fourth quarter loan spreads that we booked not huge but there are some improvements during the quarter i think thats going to be a positive to us as well so i mean i think overall were feeling good about net interest income and net interest margin based on where were at i mentioned that we continue to see a mix change but the changes that were seeing at this point in my mind arent really material i think especially in a rate environment where weve been for a while now and even if you said it was flat i think the bulk of the rate competition for the most part has gone we still continue to see especially smaller banks smaller local and regional banks be what i think is really putting out some unrealistic deposit rates that were not going to match i think weve always said to the community that we dont intend to be the highest rate in the market but we do want to be competitive in a rate environment as we portrayed it i think we find ourselves being able to be more competitive on money market funds because our betas typically have been of a range well take money market have been like in that the rate environment that were talking about some of those shorter duration investments that those funds would be making they have beta if you will so i think well find ourselves in a much more competitive situation you heard me say were not projecting a huge growth in deposits so i think that we feel really excited about the level of loans and deposits that are coming from our expansion branches i think were really excited about that weve also talked about continually about the nice growth that weve had in commercial relationships as weve said in the past those relationships take a little bit longer to get all the accounts moved over and signatures of cards done et cetera so i think overall were not too aggressive on deposits i think there its still to be seen we saw a little bit of a downtick as i said in january on the commercial dda but as we look at our trends thats really pretty normal for us so no i think were still feeling good about all that and still feel like a weve got some room to improve on the nim percentage and net interest income were not talking on net interest income so i gave guidance on to and thats given the rate environment that were talking about if we were talking about a flat environment just to give you some perspective id probably be talking about increasing those percentages say and wed see a little bit nicer improvement in our nim in that situation ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch that is good color so thanks for your patience ph there j and maybe a question just on loan growth when i look at the period end balance it would equate to about growth starting out for the year so it suggests that you dont expect as much momentum on loan growth looking forward so maybe phil give us some perspective around customer sentiment and whether you are seeing that slowdown play out and given that were going entering sort of an election cycle do you expect loan growth to be weighed down by that as well cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah its a good question ebrahim i think that with regard to sentiment i believe that things are slowing some with regard to that and i think some of it is what you mentioned that typically happens with election year people are wanting to know what the regulatory environment is going to look like so i think theres some of that i think theres just a general slowdown and some other things and interestsensitive areas say like obviously real estate commercial real estate deals some interestsensitive areas like lets say used cars for example if youre looking at a specific segment so there is some of that and i look at our pipelines also our new loan commitments were up about linked quarter annualized so recent activity has been good but when i look at our opportunities they are down a little bit from where they were last year theyre down about on a linked quarter basis theyre down about depending on whether youre looking at customer or prospects prospects were down about so that just shows whats kind of going into the hopper if you will says to me that were slowing in terms of whats available and what were seeing i should point out that if you did look at our core loans which are those loan relationships under million that if you look versus last year those were actually up so weve seen most of the slowdown yearoveryear to be in larger deals and i think that represents that expansion strategy it is a very core businesscentric strategy and weve had really good growth there so i think thats propping that up so yeah i would agree that things look a little bit slower not bad as i said jerry has guided us to highsingle digits loan growth and i think thats a realistic number for us and well get through the election and see where that takes us ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch got it thank you both operator our next question is from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi phil hi jerry phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey steve jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start so on expenses so jerry the guidance was off recorded expenses so if i take the fdic charge out gathering at the midpoint expense growth something like that for now im curious because you guys used to be a mid to highsingledigit expense grower but youre having this really great success with all the expansion how do we think about expenses beyond right do you go to the next market or deeper in cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 existing and expansion continues like should we think about frost as being a lowdoubledigit expense bank while you continue for the next several years on expansion or does it throttle down at some point phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well steve ill talk broadly a little bit and then jerry might throw in some color i think there are two frosts right i mean there is what ill call legacy frost which is our business that weve built up over the years and then there is expansion frost which is a company that has really come into its own with its ability to grow organically in markets and build households and accounts and were going to keep leaning into that and our experience shows that its great its worthwhile to the shareholder i mean for houston to be represented by expansion i think thats pretty remarkable and i think it shows it well take share in this game so thatll be higher i would like to believe though if we go past this year that even though were going to continue to be expanding id like to see our expense growth rate be a little bit less because we talked about the generational investment in it that we made earlier this year i think it was we talked about it we talked about the marketing expenses that weve built up which we really need to build that infrastructure and so some of this is building things up that i hope we dont have to continue to do and so i think our expense rate will be elevated from what it was historically but mainly because of our growth strategy and our expansion strategy but when you look at the legacy part of the bank and how we operate on a regular basis i think were still pretty tight and ill be proud of our expense management on that basis jerry any thought jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i agree with everything phil said steven i would say that even in this environment we wont go into a lot of details but ill tell you that we continue to make sure that were looking at for any looking very closely at any request for additional capitalizable items or for new ftes and were really focused on that so its not like the door is open and everythings getting approved and so im very much in the camp as phil says we need and we will try to continue to control expenses i think he talked about a couple of things but just to give a little bit more put a little bit more meat on it some of the things that weve talked about from technology and from marketing to give the two examples that he mentioned werent really in our full run rate for all of so some of the lift that were seeing is just trying to get the fullyear impact of some of those expenses some of the people that werent hired until late in the year for example whether its in the it area or in the marketing area and some of those programs hadnt started so some of it is just trying to get that into our run rate so i agree with phil i would expect that going forward i dont see us going back to a to growth given our organic expansion strategy but i would hope that operating at these higher levels is certainly not our current expectation based on what were seeing and of course in this environment we did continue to do some things for our employees where weve done i think a great job of taking on some additional costs corporatewide that had previously been covered by the employees as an example we cover more of the medical that we did historically and again some of those things just trying to be more competitive and at the same time treating our employees with grace and knowing what a competitive market that were operating in so long winded answer to say i agree with phil i dont think that well be operating at this level past this year that were talking about and we continue to be focused on trying to manage those expenses cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats helpful color phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc steven id also point out that with regard to the expansion i mean the numbers are the numbers and were proud of what were able to do but ill ph just fill a couple of things out there too that were looking at and you might be interested in when someone comes here well survey broad group of people who are our new customers well ask them what influenced you most in choosing frost as your bank and the number one response is convenient locations and number two a close second is recommendation from a friend and it drops off by about athird being live customer support and then it drops off by about say to convenient atm network and then it goes to other and a lot of different things but it shows in what we ask our customers what are the things that brought you here and remember the growth weve had growth in households and those are the responses our customers have given and the other thing ill point out and we said this before and ill update this and give a little bit more color if you look at our houston expansion which is still weve still got some developing new branches there which arent fully we only had one i think in the fiveyear anniversary but that was recently but if you look at the relationships the new accounts that are opened in houston of the houston expansion new accounts are opened within miles of a frost financial center and of the houston expansion new accounts are located within miles so again were not trying to process transactions at these locations but we are projecting our brand into these communities and were leveraging our value proposition and you heard me say that the number reason was referrals from a friend so i like to look at it as a virtuous cycle of what were doing how its all working together so were going to continue to lean into that and will it cost some expense money yes it will were being careful with it but we really believe its generating success for the long term steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats great color i wanted to ask about commercial real estate it was funny this quarter particularly i fielded a ton of questions from investors that they want to buy your stock here they like where its trading they love all these expansion metrics commercial real estate concentrations the thing thats keeping them nervous and im sure youve seen the articles too phil the vacancy rates almost for office at dallas houston austin so my question to you is whats your perspective on the commercial real estate market like you see these markets from the ground level is this exaggerated when you look at your portfolio i dont think you used to have vacancy rates anywhere near that but you gave us some color on your cre exposure in those markets you didnt seem overly concerned but maybe we could flesh that out for the investors on the call phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah what i would say steven is that first of all i read that wall street journal article late in the year about you know the vacancy rate in texas let me tell you what that vacancy rate in texas is going to be high for a long long time and you know why its downtown real estate this is my opinion some of those buildings i dont know theyll ever be filled some of them indiscernible from the or so youve got that now well i recognize austins got new buildings here and theyve got significant vacancy so im not trying to whistle past the graveyard im just trying to say theres some element of that vacancy that its different than other vacancies okay not all created equal cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 but what i would say about commercial real estate is you heard me say we saw an increase in problem loans this quarter thats risk rated or higher but it really wasnt from commercial real estate at all in fact if you look at what happened lets take commercial office we had three paydowns of investor office that totaled million one of them they paid off for cash one came due paid it all for cash its a significant deal in a downtown major market we had one that was in a medical center of a major market they put lots of cash in it and refinanced the rest we had another one that we sold it was a completely performing loan but the owner had some other problems other places and it was in austin and we said look we got a really good bid for that loan and we sold it we took a i think was a discount on it to do it but those are three examples of investor office in texas where were operating where it worked out okay because youve got the right structures the right locations and the right sponsors for these things none of these things were guaranteed and so the increase in problem credits this quarter was really more related to just banking business where youve got someone there is one credit that came up late theyve got an inventory writedown they notified us about i think were still looking into exactly why it happened they are too i think it probably relates to an accounting at least some to an accounting system perpetual inventory system they put in but well see but they basically been operating with an understated cost of goods sold they had to write down some inventory so thats an unusual thing that happens in business at times it doesnt have anything to do with interest rates or office building vacancy rates right there was another that was liquor distributor that lost a supplier and theyve got to cut some overhead theyll be fine but its those kind of basic banking things that are the reason we saw the increase in risk rate and then higher and it wasnt because of the real estate at all in fact thats sort of improved and the other thing ill say is were not stopping doing business in the texas market i mean granted were in the texas market thank goodness i mean id put it up against any market that in the us and were still seeing opportunities therere fewer of them and competition for the really good deals are still there but were still seeing opportunities in commercial real estate that make total sense to us because of the properties and the structure and the sponsors for the deals so my worry right now isnt really commercial real estate i mean weve been working on it for probably a long months or whatever but what ive been seeing ph and lets take these payoffs we talked about and we also had one that was a risk rate last year i didnt even mention it it was million deal its not an office building its an industrial deal that there was a hole in it it was a great piece of property for a credit tenant but rates go up theres a hole in it the owner sells it he brings cash to the table so thats not really its been performing the way i think we hoped it would will there be some issues im sure there will be have been a few i think we got one nonperforming office building we talked about few quarters ago but it is not a train wreck in the markets were in and the relationships that were in in commercial real estate and were watching it and well keep talking to people i mean ill keep going on with this answer but i mean these are things that need to be said you could say well whats the biggest exposure on paper and its probably your construction portfolio for multifamily and its because the debt service coverage ratios of those things its improved a little bit but theyre still not where theyll need to be to get them refied or get a permanent financing but when you look at that i think only of those come due in this year i think of them come due in or later and then when you look at the people behind them and im not going to name names here but if you look at the people we do business with they understand this business this is not like somebody who thought gee lets get in the multifamily business and find a banker that will bank us i mean these are people whove been doing this a long time and i feel really good about the relationships and how they take care of their cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 business again im not saying we cant have problems but this is how life is on a daytoday basis around here and so anyway thats what i know steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats great color thanks for taking the time to flesh that out because it is a major concern and most of us just read these articles and we dont know whats in your portfolio like you do phil so its nice to hear you walk through it and that youre confident things could happen but you feel pretty good on your exposure so thanks for taking my ph questions phil phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i do yeah thanks operator our next question is from dave rochester with compass point please proceed david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey i was hoping you guys could talk about whats your nii guide mean for the nim trajectory youve got the low rates that youre indiscernible rolling off this month and then youve got the rate cuts coming in later in the year does the thought that you get some expansion here in the first half of the year then maybe that turns south in the back half of the year and then what does that mean for the exit nim by the end of the year is that going to be higher than where you were this quarter or are you thinking that might be lower and then you mentioned deposit betas earlier i was just wondering what your guys thoughts were on how fast you can do those deposit costs down since you were very focused on being proactive i know on the way up are you thinking you can bring those down just as fast basically assuming the same type of beta on the way down thanks jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i guess ill start with that last question first i think the thought process is that we could be go down just fast but at the same time ill say that we dont ignore the market i said earlier were not going to feel like we need to leave the market but were going to be competitive so i would answer the question that by saying that we were up fast i think weve kept up all along with all the hikes and i feel like we can be pretty aggressive going down but were not going to keep our head in the sand and if the markets not moving down as quickly as we thought it might well certainly react accordingly as far as the nim i guess what id say is that yeah we are relatively flat flattish all year and so yeah i think you said it we really kind of take a stepup in the first quarters at current expectation we do have in our cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 projections a cut in march so we do take a hike up in the nim that first quarter and then really kind of given the conversation that we had earlier and a lot of it will be dependent on liquidity right and what happens with deposits how much were keeping at the fed et cetera but right now guidance i would give is once we in the first quarter the rest of the quarters will be relatively flat so we get a lot of the help in that first quarter david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay what are you guys assuming for the nii or the nim impact from a single rate cut at this point jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc the answer id give you is about million a month and again i think thats one where it will be dependent on what happens with how much liquidity weve got at the it happens it could be more if there was more liquidity on the balance sheet david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc but how are you guys thinking about managing the securities book through the year i know you didnt purchase anything this past quarter youve got the securities rolling off this quarter is the thought to just let that run off this year allowing any kind of cash flow into loans or paying down borrowings that kind of thing are you going to be replacing some of that along the way jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc our current expectation is that and i think ive said earlier that were projecting about billion in cash flow from that portfolio right now were projecting that im sorry david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc oh yeah no go ahead jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no were projecting that billion to billion is what we would be invest more likely closer to the lower end and were really just kind of saying weve got our investment guys who really are paying attention to the market and well just look where theres value and well continue to try to be opportunistic i think weve been successful in a lot of cases and well just have to see whats happening but thats what our current expectation is that wed spend about half of that liquidity we feel good about deposits like i said but kind of would like you know us well enough to know that we tend to keep a pretty high level of liquidity but thats our guidance well spend about half of it phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc half of the runoff cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc about half of the runoff right the billion of the billion that we expect david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc got it and maybe just one last one where are you seeing securities yields at this point i know a little change to the year but curious ph for what youre buying for that jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc were not buying anything i think that the last time we talked and we were looking at mortgage backeds and i think they were a little bit gosh i almost hesitate to say we really havent been spending a lot of time ph with either investment guys or we havent made any purchases for two quarters now but certainly north of billion and nothings really enticed us were really we just kind of want to see how this first quarter plays out but if we do see something where we think theres real value the good thing about an organization like ours is that indiscernible group that makes those sorts of decisions is works very closely together were meeting all the time and certainly could make a decision really at the snap of a finger so our guys are keeping their pulse on the market but at this point really havent felt a lot of pressure like that we need to do something today david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great thanks guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator our next question is from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good afternoon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc good afternoon manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc follow up to the question on liquidity i mean i guess if rates come down in line with the five rate cuts or so that youre estimating noninterestbearing deposits stabilize can you deploy more of those high levels of liquidity that youre keeping on your balance sheet i know that the deposit ratio forecasting is lower than the loan growth ratio cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 forecasting so presumably well use some of that but can you bring that of assets and cash down meaningfully as we jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think it depends on what meaningfully means youre never going to see us running with billion at the fed for example and thats just not the way we operate but could we make some decisions that had us potentially especially if we felt good about the economy we felt good about what was going on with deposit growth and such could we find ourselves in a position where we were deploying more of that liquidity id say yes but this is going to be dependent on a lot of factors whats going on in the economy those sorts of things manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then given your comments on expenses earlier and there is some onetime or temporary nature of some of the expenses that you mentioned at what point do you get back to positive operating leverage so i know theres a bit of noise in the revenue line this year with the base effect of rising rates in and then the rate cuts in but if rates should stabilize from there how quickly do you think you can return to positive operating leverage phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc its a math question honestly i dont know the answer to but heres what i do know that the success that were having developing these markets as expensive as it is will create significant positive shareholder value now does that manifest itself in a positive operating leverage trend probably but honestly im not close enough to math to tell you when it would happen but its at some level its just basic business and its just a recognition of what were developing and understanding the basic profitability of a regional community middle market focused bank because thats really what were creating in these markets were creating footprints that basically look like frost bank and so whatever that profitability is for a bank like that thats what were generating and i think thats going to be that will be positive for a long time and im confident well get back to operating leverage positions that reflect that now again like we talked about earlier as long as were continuing to do this and finding markets where it make sense to grow and develop this for shareholders and how much we do in any one particular a year can affect operating leverage on a particular year but i think it would be wise for us to also look at what is the operating leverage of what i would call the legacy company the legacy bank what is that doing as were expanding in these markets its worth looking into also manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah would love some disclosure on that if available but thank you for those comments phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our next question is from peter winter with da davidson please proceed cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 peter j winter q analyst da davidson co good afternoon jerry you gave a little bit of a cautious outlook on fee income being relatively flat and you talked about the regulatory environment with overdraft fees and interchange are you guys taking action on this now ahead of any regulation or you just think its going to be coming down the road this year jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc well ill talk about two pieces of it the thing for us on the overdraft fees is something that its not going to be a growth product for us right the reason those revenues are growing is because weve had consistent account growth we continue to do changes to the product to ensure that were doing what we need to be doing from a fairness standpoint and making sure were serving the customers with grace and so were doing a lot of things beginning in that those impacts arent havent run completely through the annual financials for and then weve got some additional items that were considering doing to tweak the product there theyre going to tell theyre telling me that all things being equal were not going to expect to see a lot of growth in those overdraft fees on the interchange thats really going to just be dependent our projections right now have those changes going into effect in the latter part of the year so just based on the proposal that was out there so were not on the od side were doing things that were affecting that revenue ourselves by making some changes to the product that were delivering to the customer which is going to reduce our revenue in the case of interchange its really based on the anticipated onethird reduction in those fees later this year peter j winter q analyst da davidson co okay thanks jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc so those are the headwinds that were dealing with peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thank you and then separately the earnings accretion from the houston expansion has been really taking hold and becoming more accretive do you think that the dallas expansion starts to become accretive to earnings this year and then secondly are there opportunities maybe to close some underperforming legacy branches to defray some of the costs with the new branch buildout jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc let me take im going to step back a second on yourquestion on noninterest income the other thing thats affecting us and i mentioned just one item in the quarter on the sundry income we did have some nice sundry income throughout the year that we dont really project those sorts of items into our financials so this million recovery of a fraudulent wire that we had in the fourth quarter obviously weve got items like that that go through our noninterest income that we dont forecast and so that obviously has a downward effect too on our forecast going forward cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 as far as the dallas is concerned our expectation is were still opening locations in dallas and so as you know the most expensive part of this expansion effort is just starting up those locations and as phil said the first one in houston just reached its five years and so as i talk about that profitability were really happy with where were at and when i look at the individual pieces of it and were not ready to disclose overall kind of how were doing but the plan was and its working this way is that as those houston locations begin to mature more and more theyre going to start to offset the losses that we have associated with the expansions that have started more recently so its getting to the point where houston is going to carry more of the expansion cost of the houston and the dallas but dallas no to answer your question i dont see them being profitable this year just because we still have locations that were opening in and theres not a lot of maturity yet although as phil said they performed really really well so as far as our projections to or our performance to our goals weve done really well but were not in a point where we would say dallas is going to be a profitable next year we are saying that houston is paying more and more of the expansion that were doing and so its really working as we planned as those branches mature really helping us pay for future expansions peter j winter q analyst da davidson co great thanks jerry jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator our next question is from brady gailey with kbw please proceed brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good afternoon guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i just wanted to circle back to the loan growth guidance to make sure were understanding that right the mid to highsingle digits are you saying thats on an average basis full year over full year jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 correct brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc indiscernible point yeah so you are i mean if you didnt grow loans a single dollar youd already be up on an average yearoveryear so on an end of period basis if you look at period end to period end i mean that loan growth will take a decent step back from the you did last year jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i guess what i would say is that obviously we tend to rely more on the averages than we do on the period ends but the guidance that weve got we certainly will review that as we get through the quarter and as we head through the year but right now i feel like that sort of guidance is really very realistic based on what we saw i think this year if i went back if im remembering correctly i think the full year average of over was a little under and so really were guiding towards something in that arena maybe a little bit better than that without knowing exactly what sort of a environment well be in so i think that were sticking with it and if we can do better than that thatll be great and we continue to we have plenty of liquidity were not holding back but at the same time all the deals that were doing have to make sense to us and i think weve been really good about growing relationships that we want to grow we talked last quarter i think it was about an unusual amount of opportunities that have come our way just given the from the stability that we have and the liquidity that we have available but were just not going to say yes to every deal that we get right were going to be very selective and make sure that these are quality sort of relationships that we want to continue to develop but well certainly continue to give up well give guidance and if its upward on loan growth well certainly support that but at this point this is kind of what were comfortable with phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc just my tag on to what jerry was saying about looking at deals and making sure they work for us if you look at the third quarter and compare to the fourth quarter we saw a sharp uptick in the number or the percentage of deals that were lost to structure versus pricing we lost of the deals in the third quarter to structure and that compared to of deals lost to structure in the fourth quarter and a lot of that and id say the majority of that would be in the cre space so its still competitive out there and i think this shows that were not just going to do whatever deal comes our way were still going to be careful making sure its quality stuff and its done our way brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood then my last question is just on the share repurchase i saw the new million of authorization i think you bought back about million of stock last year in should we expect frost to be active on the buyback in jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i wouldnt yeah i think that certainly wed like to have it available we like it to have that tool in our toolbox should the opportunity arise i wouldnt count on us being significant buyers of our stock unless we really felt like there was an opportunity something happened wed hate to be in a position where we thought we had a great value and we didnt have a program in place so for us its just making sure that if there is some sort of market cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 dislocation and we think theres a great value for us that were able to take advantage of that without having to jump through a lot of hoops brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks guys operator our next question is from brandon king with truist securities please proceed brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc brandon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so philosophically with the expectation of no fed cutting this year how are you thinking about managing deposit costs lower compared to your peers youre a little more proactive with rates on the way up and i just wanted to know just your insight on how you plan on managing that on the way down certain account types exception pricing things of that nature jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc brandon we dont we do very minimal exception pricing we do some but its not a big part of our business so let me start with saying that i think we said earlier when we went up we went up pretty fast we reacted very quickly we thought that that was the right thing to do for our customers well just really look at as i said earlier id expect that the betas that we utilize going up will be kind of the first reaction that we have on a down cycle but at the same time were not going to have our head in the sand and if there is the competition that we feel were competing against it is really pricing a lot more aggressive than we are than we may have to react we dont think we have to be the highest were not the highest today i think were fortunate in that having won the jd power award for consecutive years im looking at phil i think its or and the head of consumer is going to get mad at me if i missed it but thats based on customer satisfaction so its not all in the rate we realized that that a lot of it is on customer service and how what we do to take care of the customer both on the commercial and the consumer side but more on the consumer and that weve got a great app mobile app that i think we get a lot of credit for and that we really try to stay on top of and make sure that were keeping that at the forefront and so i dont feel like we have to be the highest and weve proven that in our relatively stable deposit volumes but we do have to be competitive and thats what were really keep an eye on the most is making sure that were offering our customers indiscernible cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc and brandon you probably know better than i do but i mean money market funds are probably going to have to be theyre going to be buying a lot of market instruments and those things are going to be going down pretty consistent with declines in rates and particularly some short answer i think its partly our expectation that their movement in rates will be sort of inexorable and there were a lot of competition in this right now anyway so thatll give us some ability to compete better against those particular products and i think as jerry said if were competing straight up against a bank well compete pretty well just being close on rate we wont have to be the highest in the market brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it and thats helpful and then i wanted to get more insight into your marketing plan and brand refresh so what are the things that youre planning to do in that you werent doing in and then could you talk about kind of the potential and scale of what you could envision that looking like maybe beyond phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well as it relates to the marketing plan weve really focused on just the look and feel of our brand how it looks in the marketplace and trying to differentiate it from sort of the sea of sameness thats out there and really trying to reduce for sure the lack of awareness about our brand and if you are aware we really want to reduce indifference to the brand and so were trying to utilize things that just visually help us there were also weve put out some new ads that sort of reflect who we are and some of the amazing stories of customer service that were going to have and we do that with a little bit of humor and a wink thats typical of frost bank and so i think that the campaign that way is going to be really good but if you look at it under the hood indiscernible i think weve done a lot better job i know we have bringing in partners that are helping us do a better job with digital marketing and in effectiveness and our digital offerings and really that even translates into some of the direct mail pieces that we do and a lot of that in connection with some of these branches that were opening in these new markets making sure that our response rates indiscernible improving so weve seen some interesting results in that with our new partners and i expect that to be something that helps drive customer acquisition going forward so well see right ive learned everyones a marketing expert indiscernible brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it yeah just trying to make just trying to get a sense of this is not kind of a herculean effort and just kind of more incremental on the margins phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i dont think so i think its weve built our infrastructure in terms of our internal marketing resources and capabilities so that is something that was really a part of what the expense base growth was last year by and large therell be some follow on as those things annualize to a full year in but a lot of it is just utilizing the market spend that we have been spending but doing it in a more effective way but its not the same level of indiscernible i go back to the generational investment that we did in it its generational through marketing but its not the same size of that investment as it was cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc great thanks for taking my questions phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator in the interest of time we are going to ask that analysts please limit yourself to one question as we proceed our next question is from john pancari with evercore isi please proceed john your line is live okay and our next question will be from brody preston with ubs please proceed brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey everyone im going to wrap a few into my one here if you dont mind jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah sure brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc theyre all on nii jerry so jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc all right brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc indiscernible i know youre relying a little bit more on the averages and your other period end but if i am working on it up to period end it looks like the loans and the deposits should kind of the deposit should fund the loans and then youre going to reinvest half of the billion so you got about billion of cash flows left over from the securities book naturally im wondering if thats going to go into just kind of pushing off the remaining repurchase agreements that you have on board and then secondly i was wondering if you all would provide us with what the period end savings and interestbearing checking and money market accounts look like just because its a little over a week until we get the k and we can update models in the interim there jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah youre saying just the period end rates brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc no the period end balances cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc oh the period end balances yeah we can get them here for you but and if we dont get them to you ab can certainly give those to you offline if you want to do that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc im sorry i forgot your first question that you brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc thats okay jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc what were you trying to get at im sorry brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i was saying if i look at the guidance and look at like the implied period end i know youre relying more on the averages im wondering it looks like the deposits can fund the loan growth that you got im wondering what youre going to do with the additional billion jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah im sorry yes im sorry i apologize yeah brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc thats okay jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc so you mentioned repos so for us customer repos is really a these customers for the most part are really longterm customers and there is a feature within that product that we make available to them that allows them to utilize the product and so even though its fully collateralized they do take a haircut versus the respective mma rate and we may do a little bit of exception pricing there but for the most part its really a very successful product for us there are some transactional pieces of it that work to their benefit and they want to be in that product but this isnt hot money in any way these are longterm customers a lot of them have other deposit have deposit relationships as well significant deposit relationships so from our end weve got a significant amount of cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 collateral it really its a good operating business for us and we dont have any intention of reducing that sort of a product brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc and what do you do jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc from that standpoint brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc indiscernible in that what do you do with the additional billion of cash flows and because if you park it indiscernible jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah so at this point what we would probably do and what were modeling is that we would continue to keep those balances at the fed i think i said earlier we just kind of want to see what happens as far as deposits are concerned deposit flows and so from our assumptions today were really just increasing our balances at the fed brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc understood thank you very much jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator and our final question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks for the opportunity im going to tease brody but thats just cruel to box him into one question im kidding brody anyway just on mortgage how material do you expect it to be in you said youre all built out and im just curious on your willingness to hold in on the balance sheet how big could it be and do you expect to sell any of the production phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well i can answer the last part of it we dont expect to sell any of the production so its really jerry might have a better feel for that but its not going to be as its ramping up right and so i think what we said early on when we started this is we expected in five years it would be you know the same as the rest of the consumer portfolio cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 so at that point i think it was around billion estimate of what it would be and so were beginning to ramp up its a worse market than when we started right in terms of whats available out there housing wise but i would say it would be i would let me venture i guess millionish jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc sure jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc someone in our mortgage department but its just falling down when i said that jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right so not terribly material but all i know jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no it just not its not huge its not wagging the dogs but it is going to be just solid growth as we continue to develop that product jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thanks guys i appreciate it jerry i think you should have said consensus is a little bit low my calc is its a little bit low not by much but thats my comment jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i appreciate your input thank you john jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc
