jerry salinas will provide additional comments and then were going to open up for your questions in the first quarter cullenfrost earned million or per share compared with earnings of million or a per share reported in the same quarter last year that represents an increase of thats over last years level our return on average assets and average common equity in the first quarter were and respectively and that compares with and point excuse me and for the same period last year im extremely proud of this performance and i believe that it helps demonstrate the value of frosts culture the excellence of our people and the soundness of our institution these results are a product of our commitment to our philosophy which our late former chairman tom frost captured years ago in our 21word mission statement which reads we will grow and prosper building longterm relationships based on top quality service high ethical standards and safe sound assets never have those words rung truer our commitment to this mission produces tangible results like we just reported and it is reflected in factors such as our commitment to sound liquidity which resulted in our going into march with of our deposit base held in a checking account at the federal reserve this not only serves to protect depositors it also allowed us to take direct benefit from federal reserve interest rate increases as they continued to fight inflation by sharing these benefits with our depositors throughout this upward rate cycle im convinced weve built not only balances but also trust with our deposit customers to have a level of bank deposits generally been impacted by these higher rates and the feds quantitative tightening of course they have remember our deposits peaked in august of last year did most banks see movement by some nervous depositors last month in the wake of the failure of some specialized banks of course they did but keep this in mind frost did not take on any federal home loan bank advances we did not participate in any special liquidity facility or government borrowing we did not access any wholesale funding and we did not utilize any reciprocal insurance arrangements to build insured deposit percentages and while lending out only of our deposit base at quarter end we continued to provide consistent capital to our customers and communities by growing our average loan portfolio over the year by in line with our high single digits target we also continued to successfully execute our focus on organic expansion in major texas markets for example our houston expansion including the original location buildout plus the partial completion of three additional locations in what we call houston continue to mature and exceed pro formas with a of our household goal of our loan goal and of our deposit goal ill add that in a moment jerry will share some insights into the financial impact from the maturing houston expansion in addition our dallas expansion just reached the halfway mark this week and currently stands at of our new household goal of our loan goal and of our deposit goal now taking a closer look at the quarter our consumer business continues to perform extremely well in fact the first quarter represented an alltime high for net new customers up from the first quarter of last year even more impressive to me was the fact that for the month of march we exceeded our previous alltime monthly record for net new consumer customers by thats over more customers than our previous record our bankers are busy cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 looking at this increase in new customer growth it was led by dallas and houston our two expansion markets which accounted for of this household growth houston was up and dallas was up and even our headquarters market of san antonio saw net new household growth in march of average consumer deposit balances for the first quarter declined from the fourth quarter of last year as customers continued to spend excess balances and take advantage of significantly higher rate opportunities most of that decline was in our consumer checking balances which was partially offset by increases in consumer cd balances as customers took advantage of our highest available rates but i think its important to note that looking at the period march to april consumer checking balances were actually up consumer loan growth ended the quarter at billion or higher than the first quarter of last year driven by consumer real estate as our home improvement and home equity products continue to be the right product at the right time for customers with lowrate first mortgages credit continues to be excellent with average credit scores exceeding our new mortgage pilot program continued to originate loans for employees and were very pleased with the experience weve been able to provide we look forward to rolling the product out to the market when we begin offering it initially in our dallas region later in the second quarter looking at our commercial business its clear that even as our volumes increased in the same quarter a year ago the increases in interest rates by the fed are having their intended effect of slowing the rate of growth for commercial activity particularly in the commercial real estate sector im pleased with our prospecting efforts in the market as we increased our number of calls by over the fourth quarter that resulted in a linked quarter increase in the dollar amount of prospect deals we looked at and we actually booked more prospect dollars for this same period however we saw the dollars of customer deals we looked at and booked both fall by around for the same period and this was reflected particularly in a decline in the dollar value of customer cre deals we looked at and a decline in the dollar value of customer cre deals booked it shouldnt be a surprise that commercial real estate activity is moderating in this rate environment looking forward our dollar volume of total new opportunities in our pipeline is up from the end of and looking out at just the next days the gross pipeline is up from year end but when probability weighted by our loan officers it looks pretty flat so id have to say im seeing some mixed signals in the tea leaves and well just have to see how it turns out while i can say definitively is that between march and april average loans are up million so to this point were still seeing decent growth credit quality continues to be strong by historical standards problem loans which we define as risk grade or higher were million at quarter end down million or from the first quarter of last year and up million from our yearend level nonperforming loans were million at quarter end down from a year ago and flat from the previous quarter chargeoffs for the quarter were million up million from the first quarter of last year and represented an annualized basis points of average loans now regarding commercial real estate as we noted last quarter overall our commercial real estate portfolio metrics continue to indicate good operating performance across all asset types with acceptable debt service cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 coverage ratios and loan to values total cre commitments were billion at quarter end with billion funded and outstanding within this portfolio what we would consider to be the major categories of investor cre things like office multifamily retail and industrial as examples total billion or of cre commitments our investor cre portfolio has held up well exhibiting an overall average loan to value of about and loan to cost of about and acceptable reported debt service coverage ratios higher interest rates have certainly led to some decline in coverage ratios and will probably lead to some valuation declines but were starting from a strong position with good cushion specifically in the office building portfolio which is top of mind in the current environment and including medical office we have about billion committed and billion outstanding with about half of that being owner occupied buildings we consider owner occupied properties to have a lower risk profile due to reliance on our ci borrowers operating cash flow rather than income generated from underlying real estate and borrowers in our ci portfolio have held up very well as we operate in some of the strongest markets in the united states the investor office portfolio exhibited an average loan to value of and an average debt service coverage ratio of at current interest rates again starting from a strong position with cushion for potential valuation declines our comfort level with our office portfolio continues to be based on the character and experience of our borrowers and sponsors the predominantly class a nature of our office building projects and the fact that of the exposure is associated with stabilized projects that are leased it also helps be operating in texas finally im happy to report we learned in the first quarter that for the seventh year in a row frost had received the highest number of greenwich excellence and best brand awards of any bank in the nation the greenwich awards are given for providing superior service advice and performance to small business and middle market banking clients in addition we learned that for the 14th year in a row frost had received the highest ranking in customer satisfaction in the jd power us retail banking satisfaction study for texas none of these accomplishments would be possible without our outstanding staff always striving to go above and beyond to make peoples lives better they made it all happen and im immensely proud of them and our great company now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil i wanted to start off first by talking a little bit about our houston expansion results as a reminder we announced our planned initial 25branch expansion in houston in the last of those branches which we refer to as houston was opened in so these branches are still in what i would call the development stage weve been very pleased with the volumes weve been able to achieve as weve mentioned previously in some of these calls looking at the first quarter linked quarter annualized growth in average balances for these locations was for deposits and for loans also im happy to say that houston is now profitable as those branches earned approximately million pretax in the month of march or a share after tax and we would expect that their performance will continue to improve cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 now moving to our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the first quarter was up basis points from the reported last quarter higher yields on both balances held at the fed and loans had the largest positive impact on our net interest margin percentage the increase was also positively impacted to a much lesser extent by a higher yield on investment securities these positive impacts were partially offset by higher costs on both deposits and repurchase agreements and the impact of lower balances held at the fed looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the first quarter up billion from the fourth quarter average as we continued to deploy some of our excess liquidity during the quarter we made investment purchases during the quarter of approximately billion which included billion in agency mbs securities with a yield of and million in municipal securities with a taxable equivalent yield of about during the first quarter we sold about billion in investment securities about million in municipals and about million in agency mbs securities as we took advantage of market dislocation which allowed us to improve interest income going forward we recognized a net gain of about on those transactions the net unrealized loss on the available for sale portfolio at the end of the quarter was billion an improvement of million from the billion reported at yearend the net unrealized loss on the held to maturity portfolio at the end of the quarter was million down million from yearend the taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio in the first quarter was up basis points from the fourth quarter the taxable portfolio which averaged billion up approximately billion from the prior quarter had a yield of up basis points from the prior quarter impacted by the higher yields on recently purchased agency mbs securities our tax exempt municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the first quarter up about million for the fourth quarter and had a taxable equivalent yield of up basis points from the prior quarter at the end of the first quarter approximately of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psfinsured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the first quarter was years down from years at the end of the fourth quarter looking at deposits on a linked quarter basis average deposits were down billion or with about two thirds of the decrease coming from noninterest bearing deposits and onethird coming from interestbearing deposits i want to talk a little bit more about our noninterestbearing deposits which totaled billion at the end of the quarter with of that amount being commercial demand deposits related to these commercial ddas i had mentioned previously that this category was the most atrisk given the high interest rate as commercial treasurers and cfos were beginning to focus on those balances as any balances above amounts needed for normal transactional operational amounts were not earning any interest when rates were at or near zero that was not a big deal but as rates started to go up we had seen some reduction in our dda balances that began in the septemberoctober timeframe and we mentioned those balances were the most atrisk and we suspected that those balances would continue to decrease which they have these decreases did not accelerate after the bank failures in march the decrease in the monthly average balance from january to february was million the average balance then decreased million between february and march and into april the average balance is down million from the march average these decreases have not been unusual and were not unexpected cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 looking at total interestbearing deposits theyve been pretty stable during the period at the end of december they stood at billion and decreased million to end the quarter at billion the average balance for both the month of march and april monthtodate is billion so basically flat during this time period customer repos for the first quarter averaged billion up million from the billion average in the fourth quarter as we saw some deposit flows into our repo product during the quarter the cost of interestbearing deposits for the quarter was up basis points from the fourth quarter looking at noninterest income on a linkedquarter basis so i just wanted to point out a couple of items trust and investment management fees were down million or driven by decreases in estate fees of million real estate fees of and oil and gas fees down estate fees and real estate fees can fluctuate based on the number of estates settled or properties sold respectively insurance commissions and fees were up million or from the fourth quarter driven by higher property and casualty contingent bonuses up million benefits commissions up million and live commissions up million which those live commissions contend to be kind of choppy as a reminder the first quarter is typically our strongest quarter for insurance revenues given we typically recognize contingent income in that quarter and also impacted by our natural business cycle the second quarter is typically our weakest quarter for insurance revenues again impacted by our normal renewal business volumes other income was down million from the fourth quarter primarily due to a million distribution received from an sbic investment in the fourth quarter last year regarding expenses looking at our fullyear projection of expenses for as we mentioned last quarter we currently expect total noninterest expense for the full year to increase at a percentage rate in the mid teens over our reported levels the effective tax rate for the first quarter was or about excluding discrete items our current expectation is that our fullyear effective tax rate for should be in the range of about to but that can be affected by discrete items during the year regarding the estimates for full year earnings our current projections include a basis point fed rate increase in may followed by a basis point decrease in september november and december given those rate assumptions and our expectation of noninterest expense growth we currently believe that the current mean of analysts estimates of is reasonable with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thanks jerry and well open it up to questions now cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for questions operator instructions operator instructions todays first question is coming from steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey steven jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc morning steven afternoon steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc sorry yeah good afternoon i wanted to dig a bit deeper into the decline in noninterest bearing and periodend deposits can you help us understand how those trended it sounds like it was pretty normal but i just want to dive a little bit more into this how those trended through what we saw from silicon valley bank and signature what did you guys see in that aftermath where most banks saw a fairly substantial reduction in the uninsured deposits jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc really from a fluctuation standpoint the those balances as you would expect and as i talked about weve kind of seen a downward trend starting back in september october and yet i dont think that during those days with svb that that i would have said hey it really looks more unusual than it had the week before lets say we were already on that downward sort of trend obviously were paying a lot of attention to it and you can tell by the averages they were down but yeah im not going to say im sure there was some concern so its not like we have our head in the sand but i dont think its been anything significant like i said when i mentioned the average balances thats really what i was trying to give a little bit of color that really in march as you would expect that was pretty early on at the 10th lets say but say so that was the first third of the month and the balances between february and march werent that much lower weve seen them continue to decrease in april like i said and some of that obviously can get affected by tax payments as well and ill take a little step back and say precovid for us typically what would happen is that our deposits would tend to peak in december a lot of the corporate customers would do a window dressing as we called it and so those balances would tend to decrease excuse me increase in december and then as we went into the first quarter those balances would begin to decrease into the first quarter and end through april and with tax payments and such and then would pick up in the tail end of the year so some of it is natural trend based on what some of the corporate customers have done historically but i wouldnt say that we saw a significant im sure there were some downward movement but just quoting the numbers i mentioned regarding average cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 balances i dont think it was really anything that caught a lot of our attention obviously we were paying attention there were a lot of conversations going on between our customers and our bankers customers were reaching out to them and we were having good conversations but i dont think it was anything that i would say gosh on day x those deposits were down billion or something like that indiscernible we never saw any sort of a decrease that i would say was beyond a reasonable band phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah steven i might just add that really the seeing anybody that looked like they were concerned of any size was notable and there was so little of it id say less than one hand that i heard about and i think our experience was that when you talk to people they were okay i think its indicative of our relationship model and that our customers didnt really consult social media they consulted our bankers and we had lots of calls and i think early on we were calling customers more than we were getting calls so i agree to jerry it was and that was certainly a time everyone was paying attention and you were want to make sure youre communicating people had the best information and that if you saw anything that was sort of not quite right reported that you could address it and then everybody would be equipped but im really proud of our customer base i think it was really indicative of the relationships and really trust that people had in frost steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc youre one of the few banks that didnt see substantial outflows on that monday tuesday wednesday after indiscernible so kudos to you guys on that front phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thank you steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc on the net interest margin jerry i thought you said last quarter it was also assuming that rates went up i think one more and then there were several cuts you said you thought the nim would peak in the third quarter im curious if the fed goes one or two more times but then holds rates at that level through the end of the year how does that change the trajectory of nim that you would expect jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think some of the moving pieces as we continue to talk about is what happens to this commercial dda i think our expectations there let me start with that is that i mentioned that the april volume is down from march and so we expect based on what were seeing and conversations with those customers that well begin to really settle into the low point in the second quarter and start to see in the yeah going forward an increase and im not talking about a significant increase maybe stabilization might be a better word than increases starting in the second half of the year so if in your scenario i guess ill stop in a second and say so one thing that is not affecting us today as much is that we for modeling purposes have assumed that we wont make any more investment purchases this year and the reason we took that out of the model was more given all the noise and concerns about liquidity and all the questions that were coming up we just appreciated the flexibility we could cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 give ourselves if we took that out of the assumptions now im not saying we wont buy anything but its good to have that built into our base that should we see something opportunistically we can take advantage so were going to be under in a higher rate environment were going to be in a little bit of a lower sort of operating performance standpoint because were not going to be investing at what you might expect might be higher rates and again some of this is going to be dependent also on deposit betas i think we right now feel pretty good on our deposit cost what were paying our depositors were being a little bit more aggressive on our cds its something that we really want to make sure that were helping our customers make one decision and the decision being that they want to bank with frost and so being a little bit more aggressive there so i think those are the two things that potentially could have an impact on the net interest margin so in our scenario we project one a nim thats relatively flat for the rest of the year again a lot of it is going to be dependent on what happens with those demand deposits but in a scenario where ive got one rate increase i think you said no cuts but maybe another increase after that i think what we project is for any basis point increase roughly we would expect about ph million pretax improvement in net interest income if that kind of helps you out there steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah thats very helpful if i could sneak one last one in just on liquidity where did cash level then on a period end basis and how do you think about that balance moving forward thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah we were i think phil may have said in his comments at the end of the quarter we were of deposits is kind of where we ended up and the number that ill give it to you as of today i think we were at little shy of million phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc billion jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc billion excuse me yeah billion steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and do you think youll see further reductions in that level moving forward jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i guess its going to thats the the big question is deposit flows right now we dont have any assumptions for investment purchases well certainly expect that wed get some cash flow from the investment portfolio with just maturities and such and i think loan growth as phil said we expect loan growth to be at that highsingle digit so cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 thats not going to have a big impact on cash balances so we yeah i think all things being equal we could be in this ballpark for the rest of the year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i appreciate all the color jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator thank you the next question is coming from peter winter of da davidson please go ahead peter j winter q analyst da davidson co thanks i was wondering can you talk about some of the strategies to reduce some of the asset sensitivity in light of the forward curve and your outlook for some rate cuts phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc well i think before if we just talk about asset sensitivity and reducing it we said for some time that there are really three things that we look at as providing some measure of protection we are asset sensitive and so thats we cant obviate that totally but the three things are if we were willing to lock in some of the rates by extending on the yield curve out from the daily fed balance that were maintaining so thats one thing and the second thing is that because weve done so much work increasing our deposit rates over time really beginning with the cycle of rate increases weve got builtin capacity to respond to rate reductions in the event they happen we can lower those down so that helps and then the third thing that weve got really in our business is what are business volumes going to do and are we able to continue to grow organically and post good numbers there the outlook looks good but well just have to see what happens there and so thats the third piece of it and there i will say that with regard to hedging program that type of thing we continue to look at those for opportunities its been our position that those have been we really dont see value in there visàvis cash markets or other things and so we really havent availed ourselves of that we continue to look at that and they may be a part of what we do if we feel like theres opportunity there for the company and for shareholders so thats really our perspective on it peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it and you mentioned that youre still comfortable with the highsingle digit loan growth and im just wondering in this environment weve been hearing that certain lenders are pulling back or tightening underwriting standards do you think theres going to be opportunities for you guys to take market share just given the strength of your balance sheet and strong capital cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc peter thats a great question we were actually talking about this morning thats a little bit of a wild card i would say well i dont see it definitely in our pipeline numbers yet i hear about it anecdotally and im aware of some deals where banks were not able to complete a transaction that they had offered on the same terms and we ended up getting some of those my gut tells me thats going to happen more what were going to have to do though is were going to have to be prudent and careful in the deals that were seeing particularly in the commercial real estate space because developers and our customers tell us that its easier to get equity than it is to get debt capital these days and so you can imagine cell phones ringing a lot and we dont do transactions we bank people and we have longterm relationships so weve got to be really prudent and taking advantage of that i think therell probably be a little maybe a little bit less of that in the ci space i hope not i really would love to expand the ci business because its the long term its got a long sales cycle but its very profitable and so lets hope and i think that is the wild card right now as we move through the rest of this year we see banks that are indiscernible their horns because of liquidity issues we could see a little bit of a little bit of growth there peter j winter q analyst da davidson co great thanks phil phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc you bet operator thank you the next question is coming from brady gailey of kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks good afternoon guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so expense growth has been midteens for the last well it was last year youre expecting it to be this year i know some of that is driven by what has happened in dallas and in houston but when you think about longer term expense growth what is the right level there im guessing its somewhere back in the mid to highsingle digit level cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah just as a reminder i think it was driven primarily by what you mentioned were obviously introducing our new mortgage product and the impact of the expansions but in addition we talked last quarter about the fact that we were making a significant investment in it this year so just as a reminder on kind of whats driving the expense growth yeah i would say that in a in a more normalized environment as were expecting for next year i would think that your comment about highsingle digits is what i would expect at this point brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then jerry just to clarify your comment about the kind of flat net interest margin from here thats based off the first quarter level that nim jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc right brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right great thank you guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator thank you the next question is coming from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon i guess jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey jerry maybe i missed it did you give a number for where ddas or if noninterestbearing deposits ended the quarter and give a sense of your expectations around that mix given as you said you expected these customers to move excess funds out if we get the last rate hike next week is it fair to assume that a lot of these cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 customers who had to reprice and move out of that deposit bucket have already done so so we are at a point where your noninterest bearing balances should begin to stabilize or is that not the right way to think about it jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i think ebrahim thats kind of where were at we kind of expect that those balances i think the people that had excess balances in those ddas have really put a lot of time and effort in getting those balances moved out of there being more efficient in their managing their cash positions but i do expect that well still see some of that in the second quarter and as i mentioned i think this hopefully is a low point for us the second quarter were not projecting currently that we see a huge increase but we are expecting stabilization and slight movements up through the rest of the year i think when i look at the percentage here we were down below wed been above but i think were at the end of the quarter i think it was or something like that i dont expect that itll change a whole lot at this point were feeling downward pressure through the second quarter and hopefully after that we begin to see stabilization to the extent we see increases in interestbearing which were going to be happy to see we could see some decline obviously the percentage that we had of noninterest bearing to interestbearing was inflated the last few years thats starting with covid as those commercial balances really increased significantly starting with some of those ppp balances in so i think were getting back to somewhat of a more normalized percentage between noninterest bearing and interestbearing ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just as a separate question i think phil you mentioned based on surveys internally mixed signals and tea leaves how are you like how do you think this shakes out in terms of whether or not we see a deeper downturn over the next few months and quarters as opposed to our skirting a meaningful recession just give us a sense of what you think will be the driving factors in terms of which way the economy plays out and is that is any of that changing your outlook around investments expansion into dallas any of those plans phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc well ebrahim i wish i knew i wish indiscernible what the view would be i mean i really think things are still good in the areas that we operate and i realize we operate only in texas but its a pretty good environment certainly commercial real estate is slowing and its really not because were not getting people coming in i was talking not long ago at a meeting with the governor with the group and actually i think also i heard it later from the state indiscernible theres a people a day moving into the state so its not that we arent having growth its been the arithmetic of the commercial real estate transactions just dont work for the returns and so thats really whats happened thats the thing that slows everything else seems to be pretty good the biggest complaint i still hear is lack of availability of skilled labor it is not so much all labor its now kind of shifted to skilled labor so theres still a great job market looking to hire people so i dont think its worth what you pay for but i dont think were going to see much of a recession if one in texas in terms of where we operate as far as what it means for us as far as expanding its not going to impact us at all you saw those numbers i mean its not hurting our growth and as far as one thing i think is interesting if you look at the expansion cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 numbers and we dont get every source of new customer right i mean we but we do collect like where did you come from where were you banking before and i saw at about a sample size of new accounts were getting twothirds of our business is coming from these what i call the too big to fail im not going to name names you can guess who they are and so it tells me that you hear a lot of narrative that well can regionals compete with them et cetera we can and we have been and remember march was our biggest month by far so i think the dynamics are all good and i think that we just continue to look at other places that make sense for us to employ this strategy within the states so no it would not impact our expansion plans ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and how many branches phil do we have planned for the rest of the year in dallas here phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc well let me see what is this its april i think we were going to do i would say oh man im going to guess six more and say im within of right either way on that jerry might have ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc indiscernible jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah ebrahim i think what we were saying was through april wed open six three in dallas and then two in three in dallas in the first quarter and then two in april and one in houston in the quarter and i think were expecting to open another four locations in dallas and two in houston by the end of the year phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc okay ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and will that be it or wheres that relative to the end point you want to be at least for now phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc well dallas was going to be in months ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc i think were pretty much on jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc

stanley co llc hi good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hi manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to ask around cre office and any thoughts about your comments earlier on some of the metrics in the cre portfolio were helpful but i was wondering if some of the what are the maturities that are coming up in and and just given the pressure on cre pricing any thoughts on where these are coming out at after reappraisal cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc oh okay thats a mouthful lets see yeah give me just a minute to look here okay of investor this is investor office im sorry im stumbling here but i want to try and see if i can find it we have of the office matures in less than a year okay so theres i might be able to pull something out as we continue to talk i apologize i dont have anything more than that but right now thats a number that im able to see indiscernible manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc indiscernible phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay a separate question just given your comments earlier on competitors pulling back is that helping spreads on new loans at all and how do you expect those spreads to trend as we go through the year phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc i think its helping some on spreads i think its helping on structure i think its adding about lets say in round numbers on average more equity end of deals and its probably helping with guarantees and support that type of thing i would say the really good projects though its still competitive and we tend to we tend to not be looking at institutional deals theyre i call them smaller and its still a fair amount of money but less institutional and that means that there are a lot of banks trying to get that and so i would i have seen less spread relief that ive seen structure relief recently but i think theres probably been a little bit of spread relief manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think that if we just look at the new and renewed business just linkedquarter is the best ive got but on the loans that are primebased yeah we can see some nice improvement there and the same on indiscernible and im going to say the sofr priced loans looked to be relatively flat maybe down a little bit so yeah i think overall the spread looks better manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great

cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 this is phil so i wanted to respond to a question about the office terms it just took me a while to find it as i said the investor office that is a term of within months to months is months to months is and greater than months is so sorry i wasnt able to pull that up earlier operator thank you the next question is coming from jon arfstrom of rbc capital please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc jerry on the provision this quarter would you was that growthdriven or was that just driven by the chargeoff jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc the chargeoffs really where we saw most of that tied to jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so the what is the message on the provision how do you want us to think about that jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think that really as it turned out i would expect that thats not going to be too far off our current expectations based on the sort of loan guidance that you heard from phil and based on some relative based on really good credit quality but also making sure considerations about what were seeing in the economy and the possibility of a recession even if its mild i would assume that thats not too bad of a run rate going forward for the next couple of quarters jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good that helps just a couple other clarifications you guys talked a little bit about the i think it was the dollar volume of new opportunities in the pipeline was up something like yeartodate but the probability weight was flat what drives that difference what drives that lower probabilities just saying that these opportunities wont meet your standards or why that gap cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc no its mainly an opportunity is just youre aware of a deal youre sort of engaged on it but customers may not decide to go forward it could be that you dont think that the current structure meet your standard it could be a lot of things that might be competitively that theyre just locked in to another institution and so our officer just feels like his odds are maybe not as good as what they should be its definitely art and not science and i its really it its whenever you have again were talking about it this morning when you have a pretty good increase in opportunities like i mentioned and you miss now when there are a lot of them that go in the lenders tend to not have as high a probability because you just got of deals youre sorting out but it doesnt sound very scientific but it makes an impact i tend to look at what the weighted pipeline is and i think it tells a little bit of a story on how our people see things jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right and then just last one as well or last one here your talked about the record new consumer account activity and you flagged houston and dallas any idea what percentage of these would be like a what you would call primary household relationship with primary banking relationship do you track that phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc i dont think we do on the consumer side jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc what does your gut tell you on that phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc i would tell you that we are mostly primary there are numbers which we on the commercial side which compare the top it compares market share okay ive seen it by market share segment and so lets look at customers with sales under million okay in the markets we serve and if you look at which of the banks say the top six seven banks which are the banks has the highest percentage of primary relationship okay its us all right and thats just because of our relationship model i mean if were going to bank you were going to want to have what we call your funnel account your core account and so and we dont even count it as a relationship unless we get that account so my gut indiscernible be pretty maybe jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think that i was here trying to get some information and talking to our head of retail i think that he thinks that its about of it is really that were picking as primary household phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah thats great cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc so its moving market share yeah okay all right guys thats all i had
