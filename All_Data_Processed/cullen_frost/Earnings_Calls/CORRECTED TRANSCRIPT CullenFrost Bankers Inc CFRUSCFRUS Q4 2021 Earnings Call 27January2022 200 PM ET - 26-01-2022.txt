full year of cullenfrost earned million or a share compared to earnings of million or a share reported for our return on average assets and average common equity in the fourth quarter were and respectively i am very pleased with our companys results and im optimistic about the prospects for our organic growth strategy average deposits in the fourth quarter were billion an increase of more than compared with billion in the fourth quarter of last year this continued outstanding deposit growth reflects our success in developing new relationships and expanding current ones it reflects well on our expansion efforts our value proposition enhancements and our world class level of customer service jerry will talk more about our deposit growth in a few moments i was very pleased with our success in our commercial lending segment where we booked billion in new commitments in the fourth quarter up from the first quarter last year and up an unannualized on a linked quarter basis im morally certain thats our highest level ever the growth was geographically diverse compared to last year fourth quarter ci commitments were up while cre was up on a linked quarter on an annualized basis ci commitments were up while cre commitments increased jerry will talk more about outstanding loan balances in his comments as we book these commitments our awaited pipeline declined from the third quarter i might point out that in texas the confluence in the fourth quarter of football season hunting season and the holidays combines so that is rare that our yearend pipeline would exceed the third quarter just saying however our yearend weighted pipeline was higher than last years and was our highest fourth quarter ever turning to our consumer business i am extremely pleased with our progress in we brought in almost net new checking households that was of our previous full year household growth record in heres some additional context in we added net new consumer checking households our compound annual growth in net household additions for that fiveyear period is houston is not the only reason but its helping it added more checking households in than we did in right before our expansion began we reported in our release good trust and wealth management numbers but one other data point of growth i might offer is that our number of customers for our community wealth advisors were up by from a year ago as far as the houston expansion is concerned we see the momentum continuing to build as the branches mature the metrics we measure show bankers we hired and onboarded are executing our relationship banking strategy at yearend we stood at of our new household goal we were of our loan goal and we were of our deposit goal for the year we added new households which was nearly the same amount of new households we added for the first two years of the expansion over the last six months new households grew by unannualized demonstrating the ability to add new customers while the branches matured in these communities loan growth for the year was million or growth and for the last six months of loan growth was an unannualized loan portfolio is a mix of commercial loans and consumer loans our focus has been on core loan relationships or small businesses in the community communities that we are cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 entering there are only three loans over million in balances that represent less than of the total loan portfolio the mix of loans is reflective of our overall loan portfolio with cre ci and consumer were building a strong foundation of core relationships that will position us to grow with them as their businesses grow and we meet their needs deposit growth for the year was million or from december of over the past six months of growth continues to be strong at an unannualized rate our deposit mix is twothirds commercial and onethird consumer nearly identical to what we had projected to be the mix three years ago we continue to be optimistic about growth in this economy our branch expansion project in the dallas region officially got underway this month with the opening of our first new location the frost medical district financial center we will continue the process nearly tripling our size in dallas into the dallas expansion will follow our houston model and we will employ the lessons learned during our teams successful rollout additionally we will continue our expansion in houston adding another eight locations over the course of and into credit continues to be good we did not report a credit loss expense for the fourth quarter our asset quality outlook is stable and in general problem assets are declining in number new problems have dropped to pre pandemic levels the net chargeoffs for the fourth quarter were million compared with million in the quarter annualized net chargeoffs for the fourth quarter were basis points of average loans nonaccrual loans are million at the end of the fourth quarter a decrease from million at the end of the third overall delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the fourth quarter were only million or basis points a period in loans excluding ppp delinquencies were only million these are manageable prepandemic levels total problem loans which we define as risk grade and higher totaled million at the end of the fourth quarter compared with million at the end of the previous quarter in the fourth quarter we continue to make progress toward our goal of midsingle digit concentration levels in the energy loan portfolio over time with energy loans representing of loans at the end of the quarter our teams continue to analyze the nonenergy portfolio segments that we considered most at risk from the pandemic impacts and as of the end of the fourth quarter the total problem loans from hotels and office buildings represented million risk is moderate and stable in these areas and the asset quality outlook improved significantly during weve made good progress toward adding residential mortgages to our suite of consumer real estate products later this year this will complement our portfolio currently consisting of home equity heloc home improvement and purchase money second loans which has steadily grown to more than billion utilizing bestinclass technology will allow us to provide frost level of world class service as we build this portfolio over time in response to customer demand and after almost two years of working with business customers on ppp loans we are finally nearing completion with a forgiveness process complete for more than of our customers our team continues to work to get the last of the borrowers through the process and i want to commend everyone at frost who has worked so hard on this our team took a situation that in the beginning looked difficult and maybe even impossible and turned it into a huge success for our customers and for our company at the same time were working to ensure that were not only taking care of our customers but our employees and our communities as well in the fourth quarter ross was a founding member of the corporate partners for racial equity here in san antonio state and statewide we announced that we had raised our minimum pay to per hour steps like these show our commitment to our communities and being a force for good in peoples everyday lives thats possible only because of our dedicated employees whether they are asked to tackle historic and heroic tasks like handling more than ppp loans doubling or even tripling the number of locations we have in the region over a couple of years creating a mortgage lending process from scratch or simply being the best at serving customers around the clock our team cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 at frost is our true competitive advantage and i am proud of them for all of their accomplishments despite the difficulties of the past two years and id like to thank them for contributing every day to our companys success now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil looking first at our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the fourth quarter was down basis points from the reported last quarter the decrease was primarily the result of the impact of lower ppp loan volumes and their related yields compared to the prior quarter excluding the impact of ppp loans our net interest margin percentage would have been in the fourth quarter down basis points from an adjusted for the from the third quarter with the decrease resulting primarily from lower yields in the investment portfolio partially offset by higher volumes of investment securities and nonppp loans the taxable equivalent loan yield for the fourth quarter was down basis points from the previous quarter but excluding the impact of ppp loans the taxable equivalent loan yield would have been up basis points from the prior quarter with about basis points of the increase resulting from nonrecurring fees to add some additional color on our ppp loans our total ppp loans at the end of december were million down almost million from the million at the end of september at the end of the fourth quarter we had only about million in net deferred fees remaining to be recognized and as such we dont expect ppp to have any material impact on our results looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the fourth quarter up about billion from the third quarter average as we deployed some of our excess liquidity during the fourth quarter we made investment purchases during the quarter of approximately billion consisting of about billion in agency mbs members securities with a yield of about about billion in treasuries yielding a and about a million in municipal securities with a te yield of about the taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio was in the fourth quarter down basis points from the third quarter the yield on the taxable portfolio which averaged billion was down basis points from the third quarter our tax exempt municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the fourth quarter flat with the third quarter with a taxable equivalent yield of down basis points from the prior quarter at the end of the fourth quarter of our municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psf insured and the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter was years down slightly from the years at the end of the third quarter regarding our noninterest expense outlook for our projected expense growth in over our full year reported noninterest expenses is in the high single digits impacted by our expansion efforts and salary pressures the impact of our houston and dallas expansions is responsible for about of the growth cost associated with reintroducing our residential mortgage product adds about and increasing our minimum wage from per hour to per hour in december as a result of salary pressures across the state is responsible for about of the projected growth in noninterest expenses in just to talk a little bit about current loan and deposit volumes as youve seen in our press release and as phil mentioned we saw really good strong loan growth excluding ppp in the fourth quarter both on an average and period end basis as weve moved into january i just want to confirm that that strong growth has continued both on average and on a period end basis on the deposit side we also saw strong deposit growth in the fourth quarter on an average and periodend basis and the growth came both from demand deposits and interestbearing deposits i was expecting that we might see a seasonal drop in deposits in january but up to this point that has not occurred regarding the estimates for full year earnings our current projections assume three basis point fed rate increases this year with one in may one in july and the last one in december and thus having no material impact that last one on our projected net interest income in but those rate assumptions and the expected cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 expense growth that i previously mentioned we currently believe that the current mean of analysts estimates of for is low with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc okay thanks jerry well now open call up for questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of brady gailey with kbw please proceed with your questions brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thank you good afternoon guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so if i back out the ppp loan shrinkage i see periodend loan growth just in the fourth quarter of over when quarter annualized are at very very strong level maybe just some commentary about where you saw a lot of that loan growth happen phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah its jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc its really across the board brady to be quite honest with you its were seeing good growth both in ci cres good really all categories are good we did see some increase in energy as well thats impacting it so if i looked at that annualized growth energy added about not materially not material to that annualized number that you mentioned but its pretty much across the board cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and then i think last quarter you guys had about million of ppps left youre now saying its million so is it safe to assume that end of fourth quarter you realized ppps at about million in jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah let me grab that real quick here yeah its about im seeing a number just on the fee side its about million so if you included the interest on it its probably in that million range but i am showing about million in the quarter related to those fees brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right and then we saw the bond portfolio expand in the fourth quarter so if you look at the 10year bond yield is now basis points so its even higher than where it was then how should we think about the possibility of frost continuing to grow the bond book this year in jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah what weve said brady all along is that its our it was our intent to continue to invest we like to be opportunistic im going to be honest the deposit growth that we saw its just really been incredible i kind of expected that the fourth quarter might be a little bit softer i probably said that in the third quarter as well and so weve been able to make a lot of these investment purchases that we made in without really having a significant impact on our balances at the fed this morning i think when i got an update i think were north of billion still today after the purchases that i talked about so still pretty strong i think from a projection standpoint were assuming that we probably have purchases in the neighborhood of half of that that billion if you will again were going to be opportunistic but thats a current thought brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and those are just purchases youll have obviously bonds that are rolling off so thats just on the purchase side is what youre saying phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thats right brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc right okay jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think i think on the yeah i was going to see if i had the maturities here i think what im saying is that weve got about billion scheduled in maturities and assumptions on prepayments for the year cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so half of billion is billion you take away billion thats going to be rolling off so maybe think about the bond book growing roughly billion in does that seem fair jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i dont think youre off base again what weve said is were going to look at whats going on in the market and well take a look at whats going on in deposits if these deposits continue to stick you know we could be more opportunistic but thats kind of where im thinking right now were early in the year obviously the alco group meets meets monthly so well just decide from there but i dont think youre too far off base with that brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator thank you our next questions comes from the line of jennifer demba with truist please proceed with your questions phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jennifer jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc hi good afternoon how much of your loan growth this year do you think is going to come from the expansion in houston and dallas and do you think the dallas branch expansion could be youve raised the houston branch count more than i think originally projected do you think you could do the same for dallas at some point phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well lets see jerry might have some a few on the on loan growth from the houston i mean its i think i gave the numbers and i may be able to pull up in a second where we stood at the end of the year i think loans were cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 just a little under million deposits were a little under million really round numbers but i think dallas is going to be solid i dont have any reason to believe that they will perform worse than houston you know we look its early we opened our first branch there i should say we opened up a location before we had begun working on before we announced the strategy we call it red bird location in the southern sector dallas has been really successful and so thats the first example i have of boots on the ground there and how we do with the new location so thats been really good i just think the character of dallas is such that it is a very much of a business centric market i think once upon a time someone told me they were corporate headquarters there its not nearly as energy centric as the houston market that can be a good thing and a bad thing but it is a i think it is just a more diverse market in many ways and so ive always been excited about the prospects for frost bank in dallas because middle market small business commercial is our wheelhouse and man that is a target rich environment so if we just do the right things learn the lessons that we learned from houston im real i have no reason to believe we wont be successful in the dallas market jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc jennifer i can quantify some sort of numbers just to give you perspective fourth quarter to fourth quarter i dont have the link in front of me but so if we exclude the ppp loans the loans were up about so that was about million about a little north of of that actually came from the houston expansion so again theyre starting from small numbers but if theyre contributing that sort of growth on the change if you will they were responsible for a significant part of the growth jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks so much jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dave rochester with compass point please proceed with your questions david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey dave phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 i just wanted to start on nii you talked about a lot of moving parts with rate hikes and youve got cash deployment and securities that youre expecting that sounds like thats going to be pretty meaningful this year can you just remind us first maybe what is the impact on nim or nii from each basis point rate hike that youre looking at this year and then just bigger picture what youre thinking on the total nii trend versus thatd be great jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure so maybe an easy way to say it is the impact of the net interest of the rate hike each basis point rate hike is about a million for a month for the first and so because of some of the floors theyll come into play they dont come theyre impacting that growth in the first hike by the second hike that number most of them are eliminated and so i would say that number is closer to a million say a month thatll give you some perspective there david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc and then just overall for nii growth in versus jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i mean yeah were projecting obviously weve got a lot of positive things going for us you know so if youve got to take out ppp of course because if you include ppp were going to find some pressure there id say with let me hold on grab my notes here real quick david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc sure jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah it is going to be it could be pretty substantial just given as you said the assumptions that were talking about and some of its going to be impacted by the timing as you heard i said our first assumption for a rate hike is in may if it happens sooner thatll help us but were talking for were talking with a certainly a double digit sort of midteen potential growth for us on a te basis yearoveryear david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah and thats factoring in again the net billion in growth in securities and then which are you expecting on the loan jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thats everything yeah exactly cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc thats allin good and what are you guys factoring in for deposit growth for this year because that i guess will drive but maybe wont drive that much because youve got enough cash to deploy in securities i was just curious what youre thinking on the deposit growth side jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah to be honest were its been interesting ive kind of expected that the deposits might slow down some of their growth as ive said and its been pretty solid in the last couple of quarters you know our growth assumptions are that thats somewhat softer in i can envision that and again i might be eating my words a year from now but at this point i dont envision that well be seeing a or were not assuming well see a yearoveryear average growth in deposit if we do itll be great as phil mentioned were doing a lot to enhance new customer relationships the one thing i was really happy to see on the deposit side and continue to be happy to see is we do our 12month look back on deposit growth and for the last months about one third of our growth is coming from new relationships with two thirds of that then coming from customer augmentation that number is really the split between new and augment existing augmentation is really skewing slowly more and more to the new relationship so we continue to be happy about that and that could impact the growth but at this point on a full year average im thinking were going to be much softer than where we were in david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah that makes sense and maybe just one last one on the noninterest income side you had some good growth in i was just curious what your thoughts are if youre expecting sort of a similar pace of growth on a core basis or if it should accelerate for any reason jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think the pressure that ill go through the pressures first the pressure were having is on the deposit service charge you know we put in the overdraft grace product as weve talked about quite a bit really happy with that product there continues to be obviously things that were doing to continue to look at od fees and what makes sense and what doesnt make sense so i dont expect that well see a potential for a lot of growth there so some pressure there on the insurance side i think the pressures that i see there are more on the contingent income side so we have a pretty big and you can see in our numbers i dont have them in front of me but a good piece of our business there is contingent income associated with how those policies perform let me see if i can grab it here in front of me but im expecting that thats going to be softer so we had about it looks like million in in if you recall we had a freeze here in texas in february that would pretty much stop the state for a few days so there were quite a few claims there so im expecting therell be quite a bit of pressure on that contingent income line item in but we are excited about our trust area they had good growth there obviously the markets have helped us we had good growth in oil and gas fees which are dependent on what happens in oil prices but were optimistic especially as we add new customers i think theres a good potential there i dont think we itd be great if the market expectations or the market returns in look like but thats kind of not making sense right now so it might be a little bit pressure there as well david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay all right thanks guys appreciate it cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 abelardo mendez a directorinvestor relations cullenfrost bankers inc sure jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your question peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc great thank you i was curious if the reits come in higher than what youre expecting so for instance if we get a rate hike in march and that would lead to higher net interest income the question is would you let most of the benefit fall to the bottomline or would there be any type of plans to maybe accelerate some of your branch expansion investments is kind of like a partial offset jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no not really you know the timing of the branches theres a lot involved in that right because we need to make sure that we find the locations youve got to hire the right people thats such an important part of the success as we know and so in some ways we really wouldnt be able to accelerate that expansion what i would say is that regarding our deposit betas were pretty conservative ill say in our assumptions on deposit betas on the interest bearing side and i think the last numbers i saw we had deposit betas of say in our assumptions historically when we went back and looked at cycles and to for example we were probably closer to so there itll be interesting to see what happens what weve said and is that we always want to make sure that were offering a square deal to our customers well be looking at market rates not only against the too big to fail but who our competitors are and so well react on the deposit side if the industry as a whole doesnt raise rates you know we could have bigger benefits than you know but over time were going to see increases in deposits just given where the market takes us deposit costs peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc you know just on that point if i think back to the last cycle you guys actually moved ahead of peers in terms of jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc right cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc raising deposit rates im just curious just given so much deposits that you have today what whats the thought of that type of strategy this time around jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc you know peter i guess you i think you know us and you know us well i mean were really all about the customer relationship we want to make sure that that we provide our customers with a square deal so we want to make sure that that the rates that were offering are competitive and to the extent that that there are rates that we feel we need to move even with a loan to deposit ratio under you know were going to raise those rates because we think its fair its important for us to try to continue to build those relationships and make sure that were offering our customers a square deal phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc you know peter last time in you saw the fed rate move up in rates basis points and the thing that happened to us is we focus so much on competing with the too big to fail here in these markets that our eyes were squarely on what they were doing competitively and they really didnt move at all at that point and so we sort of decided to break away from it at that time ill say this time around we have learned from that experience and jerry and his team and our deposit teams have really been very diligent i think in paying attention to what rates are it regardless of what some of the larger competitors might be doing and i think weve done a nice job i know we have on the cd rates for example and there really has been much movement in the nonmaturity portfolio rates but weve moved some on that i feel really good about where we are i think weve got a much better start going into this rate cycle moving up than we had in so were not really playing from behind the curve right now and so i feel pretty good about it you know like i say i think we learned from our experience back in peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc all right if i could just quick housekeeping questions just other income if i take out the branch sale gain it was still pretty elevated relative to third quarter im just wondering anything unusual in other income jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc compared to which quarter im sorry peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc the third quarter jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc compared to the third quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc yeah jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc let me grab that yeah we did have some incentives related to our debit card that were paid to us in the fourth quarter and usually arrive in the fourth quarter and are recognized in the fourth quarter thats really the only other major item affecting the linked quarter comparison peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it and just the tax rate that we should use for jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think on a discrete basis were probably around would be my guess at this point peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 i wanted to start jerry to follow up on the high single digit expense growth guide for just given where wage pressure and inflation has been trending for everyone do you think at least at this stage it looks like that would be maybe at the upper end of a high single digit range jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc and does it help if i say i hope it is no let me say im going to say that that just to be clear we continue to see salary pressure you know were out to get and keep attract and keep the best people that we can and so were going to do what we need to do to be competitive so it probably would be a little bit premature for me to say that but i will say that i dont want to mislead you we are we continue to feel salary pressure were having conversations all the time to be quite honest with you steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc so yeah i would be flippant to maybe say yeah weve taken care of the problem because its something that that were facing every day steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah okay thats fair and then on the loan side with every bank right sitting on a ton of liquidity just like you guys everybody is focused on loans could you give us a sense how competitive is the lending environment today are you walking away from even more loan opportunities over structure and what is the loan outlook for phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc you know i wouldnt say steven its more competitive its really competitive and has been you know i think that we if you look at what was lost to structure im trying to look here three months ago versus now so we lost of the deals this quarter the fourth quarter to structure and in the prior quarter we lost of the deals to structure so its actually been fairly consistent you know if you look a year ago though we lost of the deals to structure to rate so were competing aggressively on price and i think thats the right thing for us to do by the time someone passes our credit criteria and relationship and character at all those elements that go into underwriting it you know its and given the cost of goods sold related to deposits which ill argue for us are as low as anybody i know about theres no reason for us to be losing business over a few basis points so i want us to be competitive on that and lets engage with somebody and have a long term relationship i think it works out for us very well but its man its been competitive it continues to be you know i saw i was asking our people about in the real estate markets whats going on youre seeing interest rates go up some you look at cap rates they havent moved in some cases for some credits theyve gone down others tons of capital still available looking for high quality low risk deals and so its not been great but its the same im proud of the way that our people are competing and the kind of customer relationships we have and the kind of deal flow that were that were bringing in so i think were doing a good job competing but were also you ive said a million times theres no green pasture on the other side of the fence of great credit quality it might look good but it is a cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 wasteland out there and so were still focused on maintaining our disciplines and well be competitive but were not going to be i can say were not going to well try not to be stupid about it how about that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so when you think about is this a high single digit year for loan growth is that what youre thinking i dont want to put words in your mouth phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i think those are my words i feel good about high single digit growth this year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc you know well have everybodys fighting this thing steven on commercial real estate payoffs right because with rates beginning to move up youre seeing some people accessing long term markets maybe sooner than they would i talked about cap rates people are worried about them going up they might be taking advantage of prices out there so you could see some deals payoffs more than youve seen but the other thing is our advance rates on liquidity lines working capital lines is up a little bit its up a little bit from the previous quarter i think we were like around this year excuse me this quarter and it used to be around a little over so theres room there if supply chain things clear up some and maybe that offset some of that so but were just competing well and were seeing relationships grow and weve got whats going on in houston and dallas will take a little while to move the needle but its going to so im just optimistic about how its going steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks maybe just one final question even though many in our industry think the branch is dead how important has it been having a physical branch in your new markets to those growth metrics and consumer checking accounts you mentioned and could you have pulled that off without a physical branch just with direct digital advertising et cetera thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah ill give you a number steven of the account growth are the relationship growth weve had in houston has come within five miles of a branch id say it matters steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc perfect thanks for all the color phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 you bet operator thank you our next questions come from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc please proceed with your questions jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good afternoon everyone jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just one quick followup on expenses you know you gave us the components of houston dallas residential and then minimum wage is the rest of it just compensation or is there anything else in there to call out in terms of the increases jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i would say that really its related to the base in so some of the things that were doing as it relates to are starting to meet more with customers so im seeing increases and things that you would expect like meals travel and entertainment as we start continuing to do some of that prospecting face to face i saw some some good sized increases in advertising marketing as well as we continue to make sure that were doing what we need to be doing there and then yeah were obviously going to feel as youre saying some continued salary pressure so i would say those in my mind are the major components jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then kind of a followup on peters question are there areas where you would like to spend more in the business phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yes yeah you come talking to a couple of sidewalks i guess we dont like to spend more i think we but we do we should do ill tell you the things that were doing youre going to youre going to as it relates to the legacy business were pretty careful with expenses i mean jerrys pointed that out and i think if you peel back all the ppe and you peel back expansion you peel back our mortgage expansion our numbers are pretty pretty conservative there so i wouldnt say we like to spend money thats not exactly what you said but i wouldnt say wed like to do that but we will spend money and we will invest were going to continue to do this and one needs to know it well continue to invest in expanding our business so if you look at things that well invest and were cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 going to continue expanding on this organic growth strategy theres a great payoff in it and it comes closer and closer to that harvesting phase of these new locations every year so were going to do that were going to continue to invest in our people jerry talked about what weve been seeing there ill talk to you about how we went to a minimum wage you know were investing in our people theres a lot of other things like that were paying a lot bigger share of our medical premiums than we were a year ago and were going to continue to invest in technology i really am extremely proud of our technology and what were able to do and our strategy that were that weve employed there you know weve if you look at our apps ratings really high as you know we do our own web development we do our own digital development we have lots of flexibility and ability to have a great customer experience and a branded experience there so i dont feel because weve been willing to do this i dont feel were playing from behind the curve in technology yes its a ton of money we spend more there seems like any other place but were not playing from behind the curve you know the things that were doing i think are moving us forward and its really exciting to see jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay one more thing you mentioned houston and energy a couple of times can you just touch on your appetite for energy lending in general phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc its weve got an appetite for it but its kind of like that going on keto diet you know you want to get down to that weight loss level and then once you get there you can normalize your diet but weve said we want to get down to midsingle digits were almost there were but what i want to point out is thats still a really big part of our portfolio its one of the top segments of the portfolio so were not moving out of that business were just getting to where we need to be on a prudent level the thing im really proud of our people for doing is that were on the deals that we are engaging in now and prospecting were doing it on the basis that weve always underwritten things and were being disciplined about it and thats good it doesnt work for everyone but it works for the right kind of customer you know the way i think about that business is ive always thought about it kind of like a multifamily construction business right i mean we can do as much multifamily construction lending as we wanted to we could take that loan to deposit ratio and get it wherever you want it over the next year right but thats not the right thing for us to do it is an important asset class to us but we do it a certain way and we do it with people that we are familiar with and have had great relationships with or have wanted to have great relationships with and does it work for every deal for everyone no it doesnt but those customers that do business with us they know what well do and they know what works with us and they like to do business with us were not going to do every deal for everybody but we do a lot of deals for them and i see that being the same thing and same approach we take in the energy business wont work for everyone the way we do it but were going to do it in such a way that when energy prices move down and they will its a commodity business we dont want our shareholders losing sleep about it i sure they dont want to lose sleep about it and were going to be underwritten in a way that we feel good about it and there are ways you can do that well and thats what were focused on and its not going to be such a large level that cullenfrost becomes the next easy short when energy prices start moving down jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thank you well that makes sense cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah operator thank you there are
