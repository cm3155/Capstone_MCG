basis what we call houston and houston we stand at of deposit goal of loan goal and of our new household goal breaking out the two houston stands at of deposit goal having recently experienced similar commercial deposit trends as the legacy company of loan goal and of new household goal houston which we expect to complete later this year or early in we stand at of deposit goal of loan goal and of our new household goal for the dallas market expansion we stand at of deposit goal of loan goal and of our new household goal we have the first three locations in our austin expansion project open with several more planned to open before the end of this year at the end of the second quarter our overall expansion efforts have generated billion in deposits billion in loans and added new households cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 as phil and jerry have mentioned in the past for perspective the largest acquisition in our history was a company with billion in deposits in addition the successes of the earlier expansion projects basically are funding the current expansion we expect the houston expansion to fund the dallas and houston expansions in with being the year the three expansion efforts are accreted to earnings since we began the expansion five years ago we have added locations to our branch network in the expansion regions or about one new location every month for the last five years those locations now represent of our entire branch network across texas the expansion branches are growing at an impressive rate and becoming a more meaningful part of cullenfrost for the second quarter growth in average loans and deposits in the expansion branches were up an unannualized linked quarter and both average loans and deposits were up yearoveryear the expansion now represents of total loans and of total deposits for our entire company for perspective at the same time last year the expansion represented of loans and of deposits of our company for the respective regions of houston and dallas the expansion represents of houstons loans and of deposits for dallas the expansion is already at of loans and of deposits and now ill turn the call back over to phil phillip d green chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thanks dan in our consumer bank we continue to see excellent growth across the board average balances in consumer loans were up more than or million yearoveryear this excellent loan growth was driven by record consumer real estate lending which is comprised of both secondlien home equity loans as well as our new mortgage products mortgage loan fundings were million in the quarter which is over three times our first quarter fundings so were gaining momentum as this product matures at quarterend our mortgage portfolio stood at million and i should also mention how proud we are that cnn underscored recently rated frost as the best mortgage lender in texas this is going to be a great asset class for us average balances in consumer deposits have returned to positive growth territory with the yearoveryear increase of or million finally we continue to see highquality industryleading checking household growth of we do not offer any of the cash incentives to become a customer that have become so commonplace in the industry because people are choosing frost based on our reputation for outstanding service which has been recognized by jd power years in a row our investments in our organic expansions in houston dallas and austin as well as our investments in marketing are driving these stellar results in our consumer bank and we expect this to continue looking at our commercial business on a linkedquarter basis average loan balances increased an annualized rate of for ci and for cre in the second quarter we brought in new commercial relationships an increase of on a linkedquarter basis which represented the secondhighest quarterly increase ever this coincided with us achieving our secondhighest level of quarterly calling activity within of the record high that we set in the first quarter new loan commitments totaled billion in the second quarter an increase of compared with the first quarter and an increase of compared to the second quarter last year the split of commitments booked in the second quarter was about larger was about for larger credits and for core credit so good balance there credit is good by historical standards with net chargeoffs and nonaccrual loans both at healthy cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 levels we continue to see some normalization in credit terms of risk rating migrations in the portfolio as we come off historic lows in problem loans but weve not experienced higher credit losses as our borrowers and the texas economy overall has so far proven to be resilient net chargeoffs for the first quarter are million compared to million and million a year ago annualized net chargeoffs for the second quarter represented basis points of periodend loans non performing assets totaled million at the end of the second quarter compared with million last quarter and million a year ago the quarterend figure represents just basis points of periodend loans and basis points of total assets problem loans which we define as risk grade or higher some refer this as to this as oam oaem loans totaled million at the end of the second quarter thats up from million at the end of the first quarter and million this time last year the growth in the quarter was mainly due to a few larger ci credits mostly in the classified substandard category about of our problem loans overall are tied to investor commercial real estate slightly less than are related to ci credits with most of the rest in owneroccupied real estate loans which are closely related to ci loans regarding commercial real estate lending our overall portfolio remains stable with steady operating performance across all asset types and acceptable debt service coverage ratios and loanstovalue within this category what we would consider to be the major categories of investor cre office multifamily retail and industrial as examples totaled billion or of cre loans outstanding our investor cre portfolio has held up well with the average performance metrics stable to slightly improved quarteroverquarter exhibiting an overall average loantovalue at underwriting of about and average weighted debt service coverage ratio of about the investor office portfolio specifically had a balance of million at quarterend and that portfolio exhibited an average loantovalue of healthy occupancy levels and an average debt service coverage ratio of which is slightly improved for the third consecutive quarter our comfort level with our office portfolio continues to be based on the character and expertise of our borrowers and sponsors and the predominantly class a nature of our office building projects and with that ill turn it over to jerry jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil before i begin with my prepared remarks about the quarter i did want to say that as i head into these last few months of my career here at frost i want to say that i am deeply honored and humbled to have had the opportunity to work for such a remarkable company with our outstanding culture for over years all of which ive spent working for phil i feel truly blessed to have had this opportunity including serving as cfo for the past years while i look forward to the next chapter i will truly miss my incredible teammates who have made this journey so special i know that dan will do an outstanding job in his new role as cfo looking at our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the second quarter was up basis points from the reported last quarter the increase was primarily driven by higher volumes of loans along with higher yields on loans and investment securities these positives were partially offset by higher costs of interestbearing deposits and to a lesser extent lower balances at the fed compared to the first quarter looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the second quarter down million from the first quarter during the second quarter investment purchases totaled million cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 with million of that being agency mbs securities yielding and million in municipals with a taxableequivalent yield of the net unrealized loss on the availableforsale portfolio at the end of the quarter was billion an increase of million from the billion reported at the end of the first quarter the taxableequivalent yield on the total investment portfolio in the second quarter was up basis points from the first quarter the taxable portfolio which averaged billion down approximately million from the prior quarter had a yield of up basis points from the prior quarter our taxexempt municipal portfolio averaged billion during the second quarter down million from the first quarter and had a taxableequivalent yield of up basis points from the prior quarter at the end of the second quarter approximately of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psf insured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the second quarter was years flat with the first quarter looking at deposits on a linkedquarter basis average total deposits of billion were down million or from the previous quarter we did continue to see a mix shift during the second quarter as the average non interestbearing demand deposits decreased million or while interestbearing deposits increased million or when compared to the previous quarter based on secondquarter average balances noninterest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits were at compared to in the first quarter the cost of interestbearing deposits in the second quarter was up basis points from the in the first quarter looking at july monthtodate averages for total deposits through yesterday theyre down about million from our second quarter average of billion with interestbearing being down million and noninterest bearing down million monthtodate customer repos for the second quarter averaged billion basically flat with the first quarter the cost of customer repos for the quarter was down basis point from the first quarter the monthtodate july average balance for customer repos was down approximately million from the secondquarter average looking at noninterest income and expense on a linkedquarter basis ill just point out a couple of items insurance commissions and fees were down million or as ive mentioned in previous quarters property and casualty and benefit company bonuses are typically received in the first quarter these bonuses contributed about million of the decrease when compared to the first quarter in terms of noninterest expenses on a linkedquarter basis benefits expense was down million or almost impacted by lower payroll taxes and 401k expenses related to annual bonuses paid during the first quarter deposit insurance was down million as we recognized million in special fdic assessments in the second quarter compared to million related to the special assessment in the first quarter looking at capital during the second quarter we did buy back million of our stock that translates into a little over  at an average price of regarding our guidance for fullyear our current projections include two 25basispoint cuts for the fed funds rate over the remainder of with one cut in september and another one in november that is consistent with our previous guidance looking at loans on a yeartodate average basis loans are up compared to last yeartodate we now expect fullyear average loan growth in the range of high single digits to low double digits a little higher than our previous guidance looking at deposits the current yeartodate average is down compared to last yeartodate we now expect fullyear average deposits to be flattodown that is down from our previous guidance of flat to growth of cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 we expect net interest income growth in the range of to the upper end of our guidance is down from our previous guidance of growth in the range of to the net interest margin percentage is still expected to trend slightly upward each quarter for the remainder of the year based on yeartodate growth and current projections we are projecting growth in noninterest income in the range of to up from our previous guidance of flat to up based on yeartodate results and current projections were projecting noninterest expense growth in the range of to on a reported basis that is down from the to previous guidance i will say however that we continue to be focused on bringing that expense growth percentage down regarding net chargeoffs we still expect those to go up to a more normalized historical level of basis points to basis points of average loans and regarding taxes our effective tax rate for the fullyear was and we continue to currently expect a flat to slightly higher effective rate in with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you jerry well now open up the call for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from steven alexopoulos with jp morgan please proceed steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey steven jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc let me start so you guys had good commercial loan growth can you talk about what you saw from a line utilization trend is that what drove the loan growth or is this all share gains phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 no it wasnt line utilization steve it was growth i dont know if i i didnt think of it in terms of share gains but i guess we did do pretty well relative to the market but it was just good activity it was mainly if you look at new commitments that we had which i realize are not balances but theyre the basis of those balances new commitments for the quarter were up strongly about of it was from ci and energy we had a really good quarter on energy this time some really wellunderwritten deals good structures and good relationships so it was just good activity our people are working hard and i think i said we had our secondhighest quarter of calls in the second quarter and things are just going well to be honest steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and phil on the commercial real estate side you guys had good growth there its an area where many peers continue to pull away from are you just being opportunistic stepping in where others are stepping back and should that be a continued driver of loan growth in the back half phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well i think the balanced growth in ci is really driven mainly by projects that have been put in place in the past and youre seeing those fund up i dont see that being a developing driver of balanced growth going forward i mean there will be some and we are being opportunistic in a number of different areas i mean you may think im crazy but we did an office building loan in san antonio in the quarter and its great sponsor great project great metrics and et cetera so it was mainly though about great people we wanted to bank and had relationships with so we continue to bank people not things and we are taking advantage of business as it presents itself and thats what we want to do steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you and then just finally i want to ask you about your deposit strategy if you will because when the fed started raising rates i remember you guys were one of the first banks that started raising deposit rates for your customers i think on the call you said you were going to share the benefit with them and that was while many peers were not raising rates and then there was a big lag for the industry which you guys really didnt see but with the fed looking like theyre about to cut now whats your strategy do you take that benefit back more quickly do you see what the competitive environment does first like how are you thinking about it at this stage dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no steven youre exactly right with the history there our current expectation is that we would move in the same manner that we went up we would kind of move back down in that same sort of manner obviously i always give that caveat well continue to look at what competitors are doing but we were quick to go up and expect that wed be able to make those same sort of decreases on the way down steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay perfect thanks for taking my questions cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our next question is from dave rochester with compass point please proceed david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys on the nii guide appreciate it all the color on your assumptions for rate cuts there i think last quarter you mentioned you get roughly million in a hit on a monthly basis for each 25basispoint rate cut correct me if thats wrong but is that about the same today and then just given what you just said in terms of moving deposit costs down in a similar pace as the increase on the way up thats how youre thinking about it from the first cut or is there a little delay thanks dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah no right from the first cut is what were currently thinking but ill continue to say well continue well look at what the market is doing but our current thought process is we will move immediately as far as what the cost of the or the benefit if you will or the cost of the the hike or cut it is probably a little bit higher and a lot of that is going to be dependent on how much liquidity we have so that can move today id probably tell you if you said it was million id tell you it might be in the range of million to million so not too far different but its really going to be dependent on how much liquidity we have at the fed david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc and thats per month as you said on a pretax basis david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yes got it all right and then just following on the loan growth discussion it sounded like you saw a decent amount of strength in ci you mentioned energy are there any other areas where youre seeing particular bright spots there phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i wouldnt say theres anything that stands out the energy i think was most unusual in terms of its growth during the quarter but no i think its just been good growth overall weve been seeing lots of good opportunities and taking advantage of them david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 yeah okay and on the credit side you talked about the problem loan increase some of that it sounded like was on the ci front any patterns there or any color to some on the industries where you saw a little bit of weakness phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i would say it was driven by two industries one that weve and ive talked about them both really over the last few quarters is weve had the interest rate increases it would be in it would be in contractors there were a couple of large contractors that we moved to the classified position based on their situation and then weve had a couple of automobile dealers one was a used car dealer one was a new car dealer in the south texas area and car dealers have been pressed by certainly the used car dealers have been pressed by the increase in interest rates higher floorplan cost if theyre financing with buy here pay here their credit losses have been higher theyve had a sort of had a perfect storm and theyve had some dislocations in that industry and weve talked about those over the last several quarters the contractors are the ones that we would like to believe have a path forward in the nottoodistant future but well just have to see but it is its not commercial real estate i will say there were a couple of multifamily deals that we did move to risk grade and really that was because they had come upon their covenant covenants and their loan agreements it had been introduced at that time in that agreement after say about a threeyear period and they were below their covenants and they are working to move those back either through operations of the property or through a sale or refinancing of it and we think those would both be just fine but because of the situation with the covenant wed like to move that to risk grade and i think well see more go into that i think well see some of these flow out and well see new ones go in but im really not concerned with the multifamily situation and the debt service covenant ratios that might cause them to be in risk grade at any one point in time david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc all right great appreciate it guys thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc good operator our next question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc so i guess first jerry and dan congratulations to each of you on the retirement and the new role i know you have a few months and im glad phil is going to extract the last bit out of you jerry so but maybe i think i heard this earlier just bigpicture question i think when you shared the stats about the new branches and it sounded like as we fast forward to all three expansion sort of markets would be breakeven so two questions on that one whats the drag to earnings or returns today because of this investment spend and im just trying to get to what operating leverage that we should expect as we think about roa roe once we get to and is and then is there more appetite or need to add a similar number of branches over the next five years once this is done phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah well the let me answer the second part this is our strategy and i hope that therell continue to be really good opportunities in the state of texas for us to continue to expand we expect that they are were doing some work now on identifying those places and trying to see where the puck is going to go and not get behind that in i think what as dan said and as jerry had said before we expect its basically breakeven now were going to be adding on several locations in austin so i think well be basically breakeven next year and other things equal thats when youd see some significant accretion i think from that program and continuing to move forward from there and but weve got to remember that and thats a couple of years from now but we got to remember that if we do have opportunities to expand into very attractive markets were going to do it because as i said many times this strategy is durable and it is scalable and its been very successful and were building great longterm value here ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and maybe i guess jerry for you just around nii i think i heard you expect nim to move higher third and fourth quarter just as we think about rate cuts in the world where we get a series of rate cuts one does that continue or are there actions that you may take outside of deposits on the asset side at some point to change the complexion of the balance sheet or theres no such sort of plan to do anything jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah and the as i mentioned what our rate scenario is we do have two rate cuts in there and dont forget i did say slightly higher in the next couple of quarters so were not talking about the sort of growth that we had in between the first and second quarter which really was a nicesized growth i think for us the opportunities are really as we talked about before investment opportunities coming out of that portfolio especially this year as we talk about the latter half of the year i think we talked about the fact that weve got i think its like million just in the fourth quarter thats under right at basis points so well see some uptick there from a fixed loan standpoint we the size of the portfolio that we have that our bullet sort of fixed rate loans are probably not as significant but if you throw in amortizing fixed rate loans you probably get proceeds about of cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 about million through the rest of the year and then north of billion next year so well have opportunities there as well to reprice those at even higher rates than where we would be even if the rate environment was lower so i think we do have those sorts of opportunities going forward well continue to see what we do on the asset side we continue were always looking at that but right now i think those and the ability to price down on the deposit side are probably things that were focusing on ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one quick followup is it safe for us given how youve talked about the investment spend how expense growth is tracking this year that as we look into next year most likely that expense growth decelerates as opposed to accelerates compared to dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i from an expense growth standpoint i mean i think thats what weve been saying right is that the plan would be that the expense growth would not be at the same level of the growth that we had projected what i will say is that were running a pretty tight ship right now were doing a lot of things that we need to do we guided down on that expense growth and dans going to be the new sheriff in town but so were still trying to get the growth down this year but there will be some things that we have to do that we know we have to do so id said before i dont expect that our growth rate will be back in that to to i still i still think that were probably talking about growth in the higher single digits and thats all going to be refined and would be discussed at the at the january call ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator our next question is from peter winter with da davidson please proceed peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co thanks good afternoon if i could just follow up on expenses i hear you that youve lowered the top end of the range for expenses for this year but it does imply a pretty steep ramp in the second half of the year and thats on top of core expenses coming down this quarter if i exclude fdic so can you just talk about what type of expense initiatives you have in the second half of this year thats driving that dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah one of the things that we have every year in the fourth quarter are restricted stock awards and theres quite a few of them that by their nature that vets immediately some of them are agebased and give us some of those awards youll see that expense growth and if you look at our historical trends on expenses youll see that that the fourth quarter goes up pretty significantly thats the main driver that comes to mind cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 again were continuing to put these initiatives in place so our run rate naturally is growing but as i said we are looking and trying to ensure that if we do if we are approving expenses that are there are things that we really absolutely need to do but i think what youre looking at is primarily driven by increases in compensation associated with trueups of incentive plans and then the issuance of the restricted stock is probably the biggest piece of it peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it and then can i just ask a bigpicture question if i think about the branch expansion its really starting to pay some strong dividends and youve got this long runway for growth as you open up more branches are there opportunities maybe to close some underperforming branches or consolidate branches that are kind of close to one another to kind of help manage the expense and offset some of these costs phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc peter i think there are in a number of cases and we are closing all the locations in these markets and were moving them to new locations i dont know that we count those in the expansion numbers but that is happening and so rest assured we are looking at locations that are underperforming and that we dont need i think weve had good luck to not have a lot of those because frankly we were underbranched if you look at the various competitors in the state so we didnt have a lot to make up there backfill as far as closures go so yeah we do that and its not unusual for us to close an old one and get it in a new location that we think has better growth prospects peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it thanks phil operator our next question is from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc good afternoon manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to come back to the loan and deposit guide so if loans up high single to low double digits deposits flat todown does cash come down or what makes up the difference i ask because you highlighted your plan to cut deposit rates as fed rates come down but loan growth feels really strong here so just trying to see where the offset is and what the appetite is to allow deposits to run down a little if you need to cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah no real appetite to run down deposits we really are a relationship bank were really focused on deposits and with a loantodeposit ratio at loan growth at really doesnt scare me i mean were as phil said were going after great opportunities and were glad that we have those opportunities to be growing today the thing that will probably be more a handle that we can move if you will would be the investment portfolio purchases we had started the year i think at billion is what we thought we would purchase last quarter i said we brought that down to billion were probably closer to million right now and we bought maybe billion of that yeartodate and so just have projected maybe another to make so at this point thats really the mechanism that weve used in that scenario where deposits might be a little bit softer and we really dont we our projections are pretty light in the second half we do see some growth and those could obviously be better but we just really dont feel any conviction at this point and felt like thats the right thing to do and so from an investment portfolio standpoint thats the one that is really for easy for us right now to just put the brakes on given where rates are today if we went out and invested in some cases we might earn a little bit less than where were at today i think the purchases that we made were slightly better but thats really what we would move more than anything else is what we would do in the investment portfolio phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think jerry is right on that and your question really i think brings up something that we need to keep in mind and it is that our loan growth is good but our what it really is is relationship growth because we dont make any loans that we dont get the deposit relationship and so in this environment youve got good loan growth here but youre getting those deposit relationships underneath that because of where rates are today and the efficiency that businesses are employing with their deposits and their cash youre not seeing as much deposits following on as i think we will see in the future as these things normalize and as the rates normalize so while you may not see the deposit growth now im encouraged that youll see it in the future dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah and just something to add to that is when were out in the marketplace having the ability to provide capital in this market puts us at a competitive advantage and looking at the impact of new relationships and our yearto date loan balance growth of that is from new relationships and we were able to get million in new relationship deposits and a lot of that is because we can our pencils arent down we are open for business and so were able to bring in new relationships with these loans phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thanks dan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thats great color maybe the second part of the question is peers are saying that they expect a pretty sizable pickup in loan growth as rates come down is that something you expect as well i mean loans already cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 going growing yearonyear for the first six months could you see an acceleration from here as rates come down phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc no not necessarily i dont think were thinking of it that way i mean what were doing is were making calls were developing relationships and i dont think it would move us one way or another i think what we might see is if we get some clarity in the election the political process its clear to me that just from talking from our loan officers relationship managers that there are a number of companies that are as is typical theyre waiting to see which way the political winds blow and based upon what they see itll give some visibility in terms of what kind of primarily what kind of regulation they might see and once that clears up and they understand where they are i think youll see businesses that might be holding off today move forward at least thats what weve heard from a lot of our people so i have heard less talk about once rates go down than ive heard about once the environment gets more clarity with regard to what kind of administration we might have making the regulatory decisions manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thanks very much and jerry all the very best and dan looking forward to working with you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our next question is from brandon king with truist securities please proceed brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good afternoon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so just following up on the last line of questioning and just could you speak broadly as far as what youre seeing from a competitive standpoint in your markets i remember the last call you mentioned how some lenders were kind of getting back in the game but could you speak as far as what youre seeing today phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think its getting more competitive i think where we had lets take commercial real estate i think were seeing people move back in i think we were hopeful that youd see more people requiring guarantees i think there are a lot of players that are not doing that and so i think what were seeing it slide a little bit back to where it was cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 before but as some people that have been out of the market pencils down as they say for coming back in youre seeing some more competition i think were seeing maybe in the real estate side a little more competition from the smaller banks just an observation but thats kind of what were seeing dan any thoughts on here dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc its i see kind of this second half we had a really strong second quarter in terms of closings and with what phil mentioned about just the uncertainty in the environment i see that its being a little slower just in looking at our weighted pipeline but in terms of competition from the other banks and lenders in the marketplace we certainly kind of see it from the community banks in the markets that were in well see it from some regionals or some regionals that decide to get into our markets and so were seeing some new players who are coming into our markets in over the last kind of six months to a year so i could see the competition picking up brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it got it and how has that impacted pricing discipline right i know youve increased your loan growth so i assume youre getting the right pricing but has there been any pressure there phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc oh yeah yeah theres always pricing pressure but actually if you look at the deals that weve lost about three quarters of the deals that weve lost have been due to structure and thats the thing that concerns us most with our cost of deposits and our cost of funding id argue that were one of the lowcost producers in the marketplace as regards the cost of funding and therefore we can be very competitive on pricing and remember were booking or we are banking relationships first and so if someone passes the test to be a frost customer and theyre willing to live within our structures ph were willing to lose that after all that development for a few basis points so well be very competitive on price but structures a different deal were we have been and will be disciplined as it relates to structure and so thats where were seeing more of our losses brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our next question is from catherine mealor with kbw please proceed cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey catherine jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc one more followup to the margin just as we think about the nii guide towards for the year do you think just a little bit of followup weve already answered but do you think youll continue to see nim expansion through the back half of the year kind of equal to the pace weve seen or does that expansion start to moderate in the back half of the year but maybe the average earning asset growth kind of moderates or maybe even grows a little bit how do we think about the balance between those two things jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah no i think the rate of growth would be quicker in the or higher in the first half of the year and slower in the second half of the year yeah were again were catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc but still an upward trending margin you think jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc exactly yeah yes catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then indiscernible as we start to price in cuts in the back half of the year as we or as we get into whenever that comes what is your outlook on how the margin kind of initially reacts when you start to see fed cuts jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah again it depends on timing but i think based on our current assumptions starting in september thats really what my guidance was based on so we still see some upticks again thats that kind of slows down the growth but we do continue to see that sort of growth projected out through the rest of this year cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great is it still nim expansion but just less if we get cuts and just to that kind of million that you were talking about jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc right yeah i mean thats the thing we do like i said we do have some investments as i mentioned and a big part of it is the million so if youre reinvesting stuff that million in treasuries is it is bps but even the rest of the fundings are probably in the three handles on them at or high and so all those will provide you with some upside and again given what happens with the fixedrate loans that reprice well have some pickup there as well catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then is there any color on just the new growth the new loans youre putting on relative to new deposits youre putting on what would you say those two rates are the new loan yields and the new deposit cost today that spread jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc well the new deposit costs are going to be the same right theyre really going to mirror whatever is going on in the existing portfolio we do very minimal exception pricing on the loans excuse me on the deposit side so you have some but youre not going to have a lot of that and as far as the back book and were probably right now in the weighted average rate of say a or something in that range is the back book and current stuff going on north of catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you appreciate it jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator our next question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good afternoon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a little bit of cleanup here but phil you talked about the mortgage business opportunity earlier in the call and it looks like those volumes have really picked up can you talk a little bit about the driver of that and where this can all go and when it shows up in a material way phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc jon i go back to when we announced that effort actually over a year ago and i believe we said we expected that the mortgage book could be in excess of the consumer book that we had at that time and so over a fiveyear period so i dont think we have come off of that and its just its a new thing and were getting our people used to making recommendations on it youre hitting the realtor community understanding what it is and weve got weve just got great service and i think its just going to be a great asset class for us dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc just another thing to add is that of our mortgage borrowers are new to the bank so this opens up an opportunity to bring in new customers through this incredible product and an incredible experience jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay question for maybe phil or dan what is the significance of the plan when you talk about the performance of the new branches it looks like all are either on plan or ahead of plan but as an outsider what does that really mean and whats the benchmark that we can use there phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well what we when we started jon you might recall we started this strategy and we looked at the performance of the branches that we had opened up over the last eight years prior to that time and we said that we looked at the average of that and we said if we can do the average of that in the markets that were going to be in we felt like we would have a really successful strategy for our shareholders and so thats what we based it on and then we began measuring what our performance was versus that we kept it fairly consistent although i know that weve changed that some dan you might talk about that dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah weve i mean weve tweaked it with dallas we learned a lot from houston and as much as it pains me dallas is outperforming houston at the same time period that it goes back to our blue book of continuous improvement and so we learned what work could we do better and dallas is just doing a great job as you can see from their performance and so i would expect the same from austin as well cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript  earnings call 25jul2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay that helps phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc but jon i would say its fairly consistent i mean they well move it up depending upon the particular market but we want to keep it somewhat consistent because we want to be able to compare just like dan did and he was hes kind of only halfjoking that dallas is outperforming houston so that makes him mad but the but we can have a consistent comparison in these markets and i think that thats helpful to us and its well try and keep it that way again making adjustments for the markets that were in but well sort of keep it fairly consistent dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc and some of those adjustments or the timing what we learned in houston is the timing of when loans and deposits and new households so weve looked at those trends to make sure that again that were being consistent but were being fair jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay well the growth numbers are great so thats impressive jerry years its probably earnings calls so thank you for everything and i was just going to say im wondering what the 40year retirement gift is like at cullenfrost does it still get you belt buckle or boots or a watch or you know jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial
