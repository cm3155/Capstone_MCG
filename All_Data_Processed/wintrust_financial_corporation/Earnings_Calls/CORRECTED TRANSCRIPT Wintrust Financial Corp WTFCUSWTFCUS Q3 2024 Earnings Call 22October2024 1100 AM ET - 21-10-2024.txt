mr tim crane timothy s crane president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 thank you latif good morning and thank you for those on the phone joining us for the wintrust third quarter earnings call in addition to the introductions latif made im joined by dave stoehr our chief financial officer and kate boege our general counsel in terms of an agenda ill share some highlevel highlights dave dykstra will speak to the financial results and rich will add some additional information and color on credit performance and loan activity i will be back to wrap up with some summary thoughts on what we expect for the remainder of and of course well do our best to answer some questions at the end before we dive in let me remind you that this quarter has a few more moving pieces than normal as it includes two months of the results for macatawa bank we closed on that transaction during the quarter on august for the quarter we reported net income of just over million and reported record net income of just under million for the first three quarters of the year these results were in line with our expectations and we remain encouraged by underlying activity and pipelines we grew loans by billion billion acquired from macatawa and another billion organically we grew deposits by over billion billion from macatawa and billion organically importantly we reduced higher rate brokered deposits by over million at quarterend an immediate benefit of the excess deposits from the macatawa acquisition the organic loan growth organic meaning excluding macatawa was balanced across all material product categories which continues to illustrate the benefit of our diverse assetgenerating businesses the organic deposit growth included absolute growth in our noninterestbearing deposits and the percentage of noninterestbearing deposits relative to total deposits remained stable for the quarter both the loan and deposit results are strong evidence that we continue to gain share in chicago the surrounding markets and in our niche businesses in fact for the chicago msa wintrust increased deposit share to in contrast the two largest banks in the msa chase and bank of america lost deposit share this is data from the june fdic reports the net interest margin of was in line with our expectations and combined with organic growth and the macatawa acquisition produced record net interest income of million up approximately million from the second quarter i know many of you remember wintrust as assetsensitive and wellpositioned for the rate increases over the past few years its important to note that we are now very currently balanced in terms of interest rate sensitivity and wellpositioned for an orderly movement of rates downward we expect our margin to remain near current levels for the coming quarters and accordingly should experience net interest income growth on the credit front nonperforming loans remained low essentially flat from the second quarter and chargeoffs were down for the quarter again rich will walk through the credit results and will offer some additional detail on the loan growth in just a moment a quick note on mortgages although we tend to get a lot of questions at current levels mortgages remain relatively insignificant in terms of the financial impact apart from the msr valuation on that front as you know its ratesensitive and there can be some fluctuation rates since quarterend are back up and given todays rates versus those from the end of the quarter its likely the valuation adjustment has been recovered in terms of new mortgage activity there were a few days during the quarter where rates dropped and it looked like we might see a pickup in mortgage production which could have been helpful but that has not lasted and mortgage activity remains muted our mortgage business however remains an effective hedge for us if rates trend lower and a core part of our client offering wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 our two other major feebased businesses our treasury management activity and our wealth businesses continue to exhibit steady growth overall a solid quarter in particular our team continues to do a very nice job with respect to pricing and credit discipline which will continue to show up in our results and specifically in our margin going forward with that ill turn this over to dave and rich and ill be back to wrap up david a dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp great thank you tim first with respect to the balance sheet growth tim mentioned the strong loan and deposit growth in the third quarter excluding the impact of macatawa that produced a balanced billion of growth for both loans and deposits the loan growth net of the acquisition was nearly on an annualized basis in line with our prior guidance of being in the upper end of our mid to highsingledigit loan growth forecast also including the impact of macatawa we ended the third quarter with a slightly reduced loantodeposit ratio of roughly compared to the at the end of the prior quarter i think its important to note that noninterest bearing deposits increased by approximately million in the third quarter relative to the second quarter with that growth driven mainly by the noninterestbearing accounts associated with the macatawa bank acquisition total noninterestbearing balances have remained stable at of total deposits as of the end of each of the first second and third quarters of this year as to other aspects of the balance sheet results total assets grew by approximately billion to billion and our capital ratios increased slightly due to the strong earnings and the impact of the macatawa acquisition turning to the income statement results this was a very solid operating quarter for us but as tim mentioned the quarter had a few moving pieces to that end ill start off by highlighting what we consider the uncommon items and what they were for the quarter from our perspective the quarter included a nonrecurring dayone provision for credit losses related to the macatawa bank acquisition of million unfavorable mortgage servicing rights activity of million acquisition costs of approximately million with a negative impact of those items offset by security gains of million each of those items are discussed on the second page of the earnings release if youd like to refer to them later the quarter results were impacted by the inclusion of macatawas operations for twothirds of the quarter so ill touch on each of these topics during the remainder of my comments but i just wanted to set the table with those items our net interest income increased million from the prior quarter and represented a record high level amount of quarterly net interest income a billion increase in the average earning assets including the addition of the macatawa franchise for the last two months of the quarter and a stable net interest margin contributed to the increase in net interest income our second quarter net interest margin was which was stable compared to the net interest margin in the prior quarter yields and rates on the major balance sheet categories were relatively flat with the loan yields at for both the second and the third quarter and interestbearing deposit costs were down basis point from the second quarter given the current rate environment and the consensus forecast for additional interest rate cuts by the federal reserve we remain confident that our net interest margin continued to be in a narrow range around in the fourth quarter of and into given our relatively stable net interest margin outlook and the projected continued growth in earning assets we would expect to again increase net interest income in the fourth quarter we recorded a provision for credit wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 losses of million in the third quarter which included the onetime nonrecurring day one cecl provision of million related to the macatawa bank acquisition excluding this onetime day one acquisition related provision the provision for credit losses would have been approximately million which is down from a provision of million recorded in the prior quarter and the million amount recorded in the third quarter of last year the lower provision expense in the third quarter relative to the second quarter was primarily attributable to lower specific reserves and nonaccrual loans improved forecasted macroeconomic conditions and to a lesser extent portfolio changes related to an improved risk rating mix and an overall shorter life of the loan portfolio rich murphy will talk about credit and loan portfolio characteristics in just a bit regarding the other noninterest income and noninterest expense areas noninterest income totaled million in the third quarter which was down approximately million when compared to the prior quarter the primary reason for the decline was due to the unfavorable mortgage servicing rights related revenue of million mostly due to negative valuation adjustments as mortgage rates dipped here in the end of the quarter mortgage production revenue was also down slightly as gain on sale margins narrowed on what was slightly higher originations for sale production volume those reductions in mortgage revenues were offset somewhat by a million positive change in gains and losses on securities i should also note that the prior quarter included an approximately million gain on the sale of certain premium finance loans which did not reoccur in the third quarter and although we do hedge a portion of the msrs large movements in interest rates may cause some valuation impacts both positive and negative and the dip in the interest rates at the end of the third quarter was a cause of the current quarter negative valuation adjustment but as tim noted in his comments subsequent to the end of the quarter mortgage rates have risen which at the quarter were down at these levels because of a positive valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter turning to noninterest expenses noninterest expenses totaled million in the third quarter and were up approximately million from the second quarter the primary reasons for the increase were first the non interestbearing expenses associated with the macatawa bank acquisition were approximately million including a million core deposit intangible amortization expense as this additional million is only for two months of the quarter we would expect approximately million of additional macatawarelated expense in the fourth quarter to account for a full quarters worth of activity nonoperating acquisitionrelated expenses were approximately million in the third quarter compared to million in the prior quarter the remaining increase of approximately million was primarily related to salary cost for increased staffing to support the companys growth higher incentive compensation expense accruals and increased software expense associated with upgrading and maintaining it and information security infrastructure and furthering our investments in digital products and services now the noninterest expenses we believe were wellcontrolled when considering the impact of the acquisition even with that impact of the acquisition noninterest expenses as a percent of average assets declined to for the third quarter compared to in the prior quarter and in the third quarter of last year this demonstrates improved expense operating leverage and well continue to try to bring those numbers down in summary the third quarter results included a record level of quarterly net interest income supported by strong loan and deposit growth and a stable and solid net interest margin the quarterly results also had good expense control and stable credit metrics said another way excluding the impact caused by the nonrecurring macatawa wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 day one related provision for credit losses and the msr valuation adjustments it was a really solid quarter for wintrust and were very excited about the prospects for the remainder of the year and throughout we also continued to build our tangible book value per share during the quarter and as you can see on slide of the presentation deck weve grown tangible book value per share every year since weve been a public company and were certainly on track to do that again in additionally as weve recently attended several investor conferences where the topic of total shareholder returns was discussed on various occasions we included a new slide slide in the presentation deck that provides a graphical illustration of wintrust total shareholder returns for the last and 10year periods compared to the kbw regional bank index total returns as you can see from that slide wintrust has consistently outperformed that regional bank index which i think illustrates resiliency of our operating model through a variety of economic cycles so with that i will conclude my comments and turn it over to rich to discuss credit richard b murphy vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp thanks dave as tim and dave both noted credit performance continued to be very solid in the third quarter as detailed in the earnings release loan growth for the quarter was billion or annualized excluding the billion in loans which we acquired through the purchase of macatawa bank as detailed on slide we saw strong growth across all major portfolios a couple of specific areas of note include our assetbased portfolio which grew by million as a result of bringing on a number of new customers and higher line utilization the mortgage warehouse team had another strong quarter as a result of onboarding a number of new relationships which also come with some great deposit opportunities we also saw continued growth in core commercial loans commercial real estate loans and portfolio residential loans i would also note that we remain highly focused on getting paid appropriately for our risk as noted on slide we were able to keep our average loan yields consistent quarteroverquarter we believe that loan growth for the fourth quarter will continue to be strong and aligned with our previous guidance of mid to highsingle digits for a number of reasons fourth quarter volume for commercial premium finance loans has historically been very strong we believe the hard market for insurance premiums should continue into next year in addition our core ci and leasing pipelines remain very solid finally we saw core ci line utilization rates continue their upward trend from to quarteroverquarter offsetting this growth will be a pressure on our cre portfolio as we anticipate higher volumes in payoffs as borrowers seek longterm fixed rate refinancing opportunities in summary we continue to be optimistic about our ability to grow loans at attractive rates and maintain our credit discipline from a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide we continue to see strong credit performance with signs of stabilization across the portfolio this can be seen in a number of metrics nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans was down slightly from basis points to basis points while npls in total were up slightly for the quarter its interesting to note that npls in our cre portfolio dropped by million weve also seen two straight quarters of lower npls in our commercial premium finance portfolio as we continue to manage the stress from the transportation segment of that portfolio and we are pleased to see this trend improve as a result of tighter loan structures and enhanced underwriting chargeoffs for the quarter were million or basis points down from million or basis points in  this reduction in chargeoffs is a result of improved performance in our commercial premium finance portfolio and wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 our core cre portfolio our portfolio continues to be very solid welldiversified and very granular additional evidence of this can be seen in slide where we saw stable levels in our special mention and substandard loans we believe that this quarters level of npls and chargeoffs reflect a return to a more stabilized credit environment as evidenced by the chart of historical nonperforming asset levels on slide finally we are firmly committed to identifying problems early and charging them down where appropriate as evidenced by million of this quarters chargeoffs which have been previously reserved our goal as always is to stay ahead of any credit challenges as noted in our last few earnings calls we continue to be highly focused on our exposure to commercial real estate loans which comprise roughly a quarter of our total portfolio higher borrowing costs and pressure on occupancy and lease rates continue to affect cre valuations particularly in the office category as detailed on slide we saw promising signs of stabilization during the third quarter as cre npls decreased from to and as noted earlier we also saw cre chargeoffs reduce from basis points to essentially zero for the third quarter on slide we continue to provide enhanced detail in our cre office exposure currently this portfolio remains steady at billion or of our total cre portfolio and only of our total loan portfolio of the billion of office exposure is medical office or owner occupied the average size of a loan in this office portfolio is only million we have only eight loans above million and only five of which are nonmedical or owner occupied we continue to perform portfolio reviews on our cre portfolio and we stay very engaged with our borrowers as mentioned on prior calls our cre credit team regularly updates their deep dive analysis of every nonowner occupied loan over million which well be renewing between now and the end of the second quarter of this analysis which covered of all nonowner occupied cre loans maturing this period resulted in the following roughly half the loans reviewed will clearly qualify for a renewal at prevailing rates roughly of the loans are anticipated to be paid off or will require a shortterm extension at prevailing rates the remaining loans will require some additional attention which could include a pay down or pledge of additional collateral we continue to backcheck the results of the portfolio reviews conducted during prior quarters and have found that the projected outcomes versus actual outcomes were very tightly correlated and generally speaking borrowers of loans deemed to require additional attention continue to support the loans by providing enhancements including principal reductions as we have stated on prior calls our portfolio is not immune from the effects of higher rates in the market forces behind lease rates but we continue to proactively identify weaknesses in the portfolio and work with our borrowers to identify the best possible outcomes in summary we are encouraged by the trends we saw in the third quarter and we believe that our portfolio is in good shape and appropriately reserved that concludes my comments on credit and ill turn it back to tim timothy s crane president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp okay thank you that was a lot i hope helpful to wrap up our prepared remarks ill be very brief i would just emphasize daves reference to the historical charts that weve included in our presentation materials we have performed well over various time periods and in different economic environments we would expect that to continue our pipelines remain strong our credit approach is disciplined we remain wellpositioned to build share in our midwest markets and within our niche businesses and with respect to macatawa its still early but our wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 integration activities are on target and we remain very encouraged and bullish on the opportunities that we have in west michigan overall we like our position going into the last quarter of the year and into and certainly appreciate the support of all of our shareholders at this point ill pause and well take some questions latif question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets please go ahead jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi tim or rich youve touched on it but can you talk a little bit more about the loan growth outlook and the drivers im just jotting down notes rich in your comments you talked about both new customers and higher line utilization and i think the line utilization is maybe a little bit different than what some of the peer banks are talking about so can you break that down a little bit more and talk a little bit more about the mix and the expected drivers of loan growth timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah i mean jon as you know i think one of the keys for us is just having this really diversified asset portfolio because when some things are working some things may not be working a good example is during the period of very low interest rates we saw life finance having very solid growth and as rates came up their growth is more muted similarly over the course of the last year and a half we saw very strong performance out of our pc premium finance group and so that has been a huge driver so if you start with that for the course of this year they were up meaningful part of the increases we saw in the overall loan portfolio but then getting back to your specific question you add on some of these other areas so we have seen in just the core ci and core cre portfolios some incredibly good opportunities just as the competitive landscape in chicago has changed so much and so we are seeing our pipeline right now is probably as full as ive ever seen it in terms of really quality midmarket companies in particular our assetbased team has seen a fairly substantial pickup in new opportunities wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 and then and coupled with that weve also seen that we talked about it in previous calls we picked up a warehouse line of credit group out of comerica that we brought on about just over a year ago and theyve been able to bring over a fairly substantial number of clients that they had and thats added as i pointed out in my comments fairly substantial increase in those balances as well leasing has also been a good part of the story for this year and so again its not one thing that i would point to but its a number of these different things that all kind of contribute to the total so the utilization number were encouraged by that we think that as rates went up we saw that utilization come down so its possible that that may not be longstanding but we would anticipate that the utilization rates are probably at a level where we would anticipate them continuing for a while here so hopefully that gets at what you were asking jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah it does okay so this feels like a comfortable pace of growth for the company what you just put up from an organic perspective timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah no i think thats right i mean were not changing our guidance we havent changed our guidance in many years just because again when somethings working something else may not but when collectively you add them all up it kind of hits in that spot jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thats helpful and then rich its either you or dave on this one but id appreciate the carve out of the day one cecl provision the million and we would carve that out it suggests a higher run rate for eps but the million for call it legacy wintrust the core seemed a little bit lower than we were expecting so i dont know if you can help us think through what the provision might look like in the fourth quarter i know thats a little bit granular but that might help us set expectations a little bit is this a new lower core run rate for provision or is there we should think about maybe a reversion to a higher number thanks david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well we gave some detail on slide for the changes for the allowance but from the provision if there was some benefit the macroeconomic conditions got better and so some of the forecast for commercial real estate pricing and some of the other factors that go into the model improved so that was helpful to keep the provision lower this quarter prior quarter we also had million net more specific reserves and those relate to some of the chargeoffs so we took this quarter so it got ahead of those and then blew them out so that was beneficial that we didnt have similar specific reserves and actually released some of them this quarter so im not really sure jon depending on where macroeconomic conditions go but we would expect to have that mid to highsingle digits growth that rich talked about and have to provide for that and then when you look at portfolio mix our criticized classified numbers have stayed very consistent and we dont expect those to necessarily get worse and theyre pretty good right now so theres not a lot of change there wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 so i think its probably just growth that we would provide for going forward adjusted for whatever the economists do out there but i dont know if the election will impact it positive or negative for the fourth quarter but if you would provide growth for mid to highsingle digits and a standard provision for that thats probably my best guess because i just dont know which way the economic factors are going to go jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah okay i think that gets us there and i think you saw moodys upgraded the banking sector last night so maybe that helps but thank you guys i appreciate it timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah thanks thanks jon operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of david long of raymond james your question please david timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone good morning now that weve got a one of a rate cut in out there how has your deposit cost trended i mean what has been your deposit beta since then and how have you seen the competition react to this first rate cut both on the commercial side and then maybe on the consumer side too timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah david its tim so on the way up our beta was in mid and we would anticipate that it would be similar on the way down and that in fact has been our experience with the first cut which obviously were not very far into but what we can tell you is that since the end of the quarter and as we start to see more of the cut work through the portfolio the reduction in deposit costs and the reduction in loan yields have been about the same which gives us confidence that the spread and ultimately the margin should be in the same level going forward here with respect to competitors weve seen rates come down promotionaltype rates from the low and level to the to level and we believe just given the kind of tepid loan growth that many competitors have had that as rates trend down that theyll continue to try and move down but obviously thats the risk is that if we get some strange competitive behavior with respect to loan or deposit pricing that well have to respond we have not seen that david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 got it thank you tim and then closing the acquisition of macatawa in grand rapids i know thats still going through the integration process but as you look forward there what are your plans for potentially adding veteran bankers and really leveraging that franchise timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah well they have a terrific team so number one we like a lot where we start from and over time as we identify opportunities in the market well certainly add the resources that they believe are necessary to fully penetrate the market we are seeing inbound inquiries on esop loans and construction loans and other kind of specialty areas that they might not have pursued organically and so were very encouraged by the early feedback from the market david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc great thanks tim timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp you bet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff rulis of da davidson your question please jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hey jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co couple of questions on the credit side i think you said the majority of the chargeoffs came in that ci segment and particularly one relationship could you just remind us again the industry there and is that fully exited richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp well yeah it was more than just one but where i would say the most if i were categorizing the bulk of the losses that we saw in the quarter were transportationrelated jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 got it okay and rich hopping over to the office slide there was a increase in that days to days bucket your commentary was pretty positive i just want to see if that increase was largely administrative any kind of concerns with that early delinquency number richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp no its interesting and it kind of touches on something that kind of how the sausage is made when youre sitting here having these conversations with customers as it relates to rightsizing a loan or thinking through how you go about renewing it appropriately those conversations dont happen overnight and so occasionally you will see things go past majority as we work through those but ultimately its time wellspent because we believe strongly that its in everyones best interest to get those repositioned appropriately so im not overly concerned about that i think that periodically that will happen as we work with customers to try to make sure we get a good outcome there jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co okay sounds like the overriding trend was more positive its the front end just some mechanics maybe just one last one maybe for dave just on the expense run rate trying to figure out weve got full quarter of macatawa maybe some cost saves in there ex out some merger costs so any type of discussion about where that settles in and if you could hazard a guess on maybe growth rate thatd be great thanks david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well as i said in my comments we had twothirds of the quarter with macatawa at roughly million for the fourth quarter because we have not gotten through the full integration and conversion yet i would expect that they add another million just as a run rate it gets in there i dont suspect there is much change in the other line items too much but plus or minus a couple million dollars i mean a pretty big company so you can have some fluctuations here and there but i would expect sort of adding million plus or minus to the run rate and then going forward weve always sort of in the last few years sort of been in the sort of the midsingledigit expense growth rate but thats under the assumption were sort of highsingle digit deposit loan growth rate so you get some operating leverage but not necessarily ready to make a call on that yet we need to see how the mortgage business goes and the like because that could certainly add some additional commissions and costs if that picks up but we dont have great visibility into that right now jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co okay thats helpful thank you timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks jeff operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead chris wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning dave or tim the capital improvement from the deal that was i think telegraph put a nice bump up for the growth as you go into the next few quarters can you just remind us where youd like that cet1 ratio dave i believe you have some preferred that get reset maybe theres a swap opportunity but just capital philosophy going into next year david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well i think youre right we picked up some capital with the macatawa acquisition they had a lot of excess capital and not a lot of marks in their portfolio so that was beneficial to our capital ratios like weve said in the past were in a position now where we think our earnings support our mid to highsingle digit loan growth so we should build capital steadily going forward assuming we dont have outsized growth and i guess that would be a good problem to have if you had it so we would expect that to continue to just grow and you probably get it so your our cet1 is close to now and it would get into the range sometime during and then for the preferreds well just have to see what the market is like at that time most likely refinance them out at a lower spread but theres a lot of time between now and then so well see what happens but we have our eye on that and we can either swap them out pay some of them down or make it well well have to make a decision at the time based upon what market conditions and rates are christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay perfect and then maybe a couple of housekeeping on the average share count for the fourth quarter and then the tax rate there thanks david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i think the tax rate this quarter is pretty clean so you probably do that macatawa added million shares to the total and we ph went ahead twothirds of the quarter for that so you can just do the math on that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay perfect thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy of stephens please go ahead terry brandon rud q analyst stephens inc good morning this is brandon rud on for terry wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi brandon brandon rud q analyst stephens inc most of my questions have been asked and answered just maybe a couple of modeling questions kind of following up on the expense question earlier i heard the midsingle digit comment maybe just more of a medium excuse me a medium or longerterm target for expenses i think historically youve looked at the net overhead ratio and david you mentioned that expenses to average assets do you have maybe a target you can maybe share for us and where you like that either of those ratios to settle out over the medium term david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well its hard to do a target on that unless you know what the mortgage business is because when the mortgage business is really strong that number the net overhead ratio comes down we certainly would like it less than basis points to grow into there for the net overhead ratio and then we just sort of expect to get continued operating leverage but i dont think we have a longterm goal that weve pointed out there there are certain things in the operating expenses like lease that lease depreciation expense we hope that goes up because the leasing income goes up on the noninterest income side so i think we tend to focus for the net overhead ratio more than the expense ratio because some of our non interest income categories like wealth management and mortgages bring a lot of commissions with them and wed like those businesses to grow but they bring with them operating expenses too so we sort of like to look at it as the net overhead ratio which incorporates both the noninterest income and noninterest expense rather than to have a specific noninterest expense target and our growth on the noninterest expenses thats sort of what weve said the last two years and we would expect just to continue at that pace so brandon rud q analyst stephens inc okay thank you for that and maybe just my last one on the mid to highsingle digit loan growth im sorry if you said this but where are those incremental yields coming on at or maybe a spread of the sofr or something david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp it really depends on again we have these different asset categories so i mean they can range all over i mean the opportunities that are going to be more midmarket deposit heavy spreads will be in the low200 range but on the pc side were going to get substantially more than that and everything else is kind of in between we continue to be as we talked about very very focused on getting appropriately paid for the risk and so far weve been able to hold the line pretty well on pricing brandon rud q analyst stephens inc got it thank you very much wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of jared shaw of barclays your line is open jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hi thanks yeah i think just the last thing i had was the impact of the hedges to margin going forward i think it was basis points in this quarter whats the ballpark that we should expect going forward david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp i think sort of the rule of thumb generally jared is for every basis points of a reduction in sofr we should benefit by about basis points a little bit of timing difference because some of these reset at the beginning of the month et cetera versus the daily but i think were basis point drag in the third quarter and it should be less than that if sofr goes down but if you sort of use it and we give all the detail on the slides but right now the average is about basis points per basis pointtype benefit jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks a lot operator thank you our next question comes from the line of nathan race of piper sandler please go ahead nathan nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hey guys good morning thanks for taking my questions timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning nate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co i apologize ive got on a little late but just in terms of the gain on sale margin compression that we saw this quarter it was a little bit more so than what we saw from some other larger banks that reported last week so just curious if you have any thoughts on maybe a starting point for david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah it was a little lower than wed hoped but the little volatility when rates were falling and some of the secondary market hedging that we do at when we do locks on those we would expect that the gain on sale margins would be closer to the range in the fourth quarter probably volumes are somewhat similar and as tim said the rates backed up a little bit so theres just not a lot of activity there but we would not expect the gain on sale margin to be that low in the fourth quarter we would expect it to pop back up in closer to wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great very helpful thanks dave and again i apologize if you already touched on it but in terms of nii growth expectations i know its kind of a fluid environment in terms of thinking about next year but assuming the margin kind of holds in around even if we get another basis points of fed cuts next year just any thoughts on just how much nii can grow assuming balance sheet growth remains at the mid to highsingle digit range david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well i guess its just math that right if we think the margin is going to be relatively stable and you have mid to highsingle digit asset growth youd have the mid to highsingle digit nii so thats the way we look at it as relatively stable margin and mid to high single digit earning asset growth which should produce net nii growth nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great always helpful just to hear you guys indicate that and then just lastly just in terms of the expected growth in capital going forward i think you mentioned youre just going to kind of remain opportunistic on the ma front going forward but just any other thoughts on just how youd like to manage capital are you guys just comfortable kind of building excess capital over the next several quarters here in light of the preferred reset next year timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah i mean as dave said nate well look at the preferred options that exist as we get into the summer next year but otherwise absent a lot of loan growth we should be building capital and are comfortable to kind of gradually continue to improve the companys capital ratios nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great thanks guys timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust
