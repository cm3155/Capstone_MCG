financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 good morning and thank you in addition to the introductions that latiff made were joined by dave stoehr our chief financial officer and kate boege our general counsel in terms of an agenda ill share some high level highlights dave dykstra will speak to the financial results and rich will add some additional information and color on credit performance and loan activity ill be back to wrap up with some summary thoughts on two topics a high level outlook going forward and an update on our pending acquisition of macatawa bank and of course well do our best to answer some questions for the quarter we reported net income of just over million and reported record net income of just under million for the first half of the year the results were in line with our expectations with several positive and encouraging underlying elements for the quarter we grew loans by billion and deposits by slightly over billion the loan growth was balanced across all material product categories and would have been higher had we not elected to sell approximately million in loans during the quarter which dave will discuss the deposit growth included absolute growth in our noninterest bearing deposits and the percentage of non interest bearing deposits relative to total deposits remained stable for the quarter both the loan and deposit results are strong and evidence that we continue to gain share in chicago the midwest and in our niche businesses the net interest margin of was in line with our expectations and combined with the growth produced record net interest income of million up almost million from the first quarter we are seeing some of the expected credit normalization from the very low levels of delinquency and loss experienced over the last few years however our nonperforming loans remain low and loans classified as substandard or special mention were little changed from the prior quarter and again rich will walk through some additional detail overall a solid quarter in particular i think our team is doing a very nice job with respect to pricing and credit discipline which will continue to show up in our results going forward we are also adding consumer and commercial clients at a healthy rate clients that would be with us for years to come ill pause here and hand this over to dave and rich and ill be back to wrap up david a dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp great thanks tim first with respect to the balance sheet growth in the first quarter of this compared to the first quarter of this year we again reported strong loan and deposit growth the deposit growth of billion during the quarter is a increase over the prior quarter on an annualized basis and as for the deposit composition noninterest bearing deposits increased by approximately million in the second quarter relative to the first quarter and again represent a of total deposits at the end of both the first and the second quarter so stabilization and a slight increase in the noninterest bearing deposits from last quarter the solid loan growth helped to fund strong second our solid deposit growth helped to fund strong second quarter loan growth of billion or on an annualized basis adjusting for the impact of the sale of certain premium finance loans during the second quarter total loans would have increased billion or on an annualized basis and its consistent with our prior guidance of being above the mid to highsingle digit loan growth for this quarter additionally net of our election to conduct a loan sale transaction that reduced outstanding premium finance balances by million at the end of the second quarter the commercial premium finance portfolio would have been was up million the sellable loans during the quarter was done to maintain appropriate liquidity capital and loantodeposit ratios as to other aspects of the balance sheet results total assets grew by billion to billion and our regulatory capital ratios remained relatively stable even with the strong growth as tim mentioned it was another wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 very successful quarter for gaining new customers and for the growth of our franchise which has always been a primary objective of wintrust our differentiated business model the exceptional service that our teams provide and our unique position in the chicago and milwaukee markets continue to serve us well and we think it will do so in the future as to the income statement categories our net interest income increased million from the prior quarter and represented a record high amount of quarterly net interest income an increase in the average earning assets more than offset the modest decline in the net interest margin that we discussed on our last earnings call due to the expectations of the strong growth this quarter and was primarily the result of a mix shift in deposits and the higher costs of attracting incremental deposits to fund our solid loan growth were obviously happy to take advantage of current market conditions and add high quality loan and deposit relationships even if it means a bit of margin pressure said another way these new relationships provide nice gains in market share additional net interest income at acceptable returns and longterm franchise value our second quarter net interest margin was and was up slightly from where we ended the first quarter which gives us great confidence that our net interest margin can continue to be in a narrow range around in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter of this year given the relatively stable net interest margin outlook and the growth in earning assets we would expect again to increase net interest income in the third quarter we recorded a provision for credit losses of million in the second quarter which was up from a provision of million in the prior quarter but down slightly from the million recorded in the fourth quarter of last year the higher provision expense in the second quarter relative to the first quarter was primarily a result of the aforementioned strong loan growth and a slightly higher level of net chargeoffs and resulted in a buildup of our credit reserves again rich will talk about credit and the loan portfolio characteristics in just a bit on to noninterest income and noninterest expense total noninterest income totaled million in the second quarter which was down approximately million when compared to the prior quarter as you recall the primary reason for the decline was related to a million gain on the sale of our retirement planning and advisors division that we recognized in the first quarter and no similar gains were recorded in the current quarter and although persistently higher mortgage rates dampened our optimism for stronger spring homebuying season activity the company generated approximately million more in mortgage banking revenue as we experienced higher production revenue with a slightly high origination volumes which was offset somewhat by less favorable market value adjustments on our mortgage servicing rights portfolio the company recorded a million of security losses a modest gain on the sale of our premium finance loans and a variety of smaller changes to the noninterest income categories as shown in the tables in the press release but those changes relative to the prior quarter werent material and not uncommon turning to noninterest and interest expense categories the total noninterest expenses were million in the second quarter and were up approximately million from the first quarter the primary reasons for the increase related to salary employee benefits expense increasing by approximately million the slight increase was due to higher mortgage commissions on the increased origination volumes second quarter having the full effect of annual merit increases that were effective on february 1st and we had slightly higher employee benefits expenses due to an increased level of health insurance claims during the quarter compared to the first quarter which tends to be seasonally low advertising and marketing expenses increased by million in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter as weve discussed on previous calls this category of expenses tends to be higher in the second and wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 third quarters of the year to our expenditures related to various major and minor league baseball sponsorships and other summertime sponsorship events held in the communities that we serve the company also recorded a slight increase in occupancy expense which was impacted by a million charge on the pending sale of a bank branch in downtown chicago as we work to optimize our branch network this pending sale is essentially relocation and a downsizing of a branch which will result in lower expenses going forward with an estimated payback period of less than two years professional fees were slightly elevated due to approximately of costs related to the pending acquisition of macatawa bank corporation these increases were partially offset by the million reduction in our fdic insurance expense as the company recorded approximately million of such expense related to special assessments imposed by the fdic in the first quarter and no such special assessments in this quarter the remaining variances both positive and negative were relatively normal and dont warrant any special mention on this call summary of the second quarter exhibited extraordinarily strong loan and deposit growth a solid net interest margin in our expected range a record level of quarterly net interest income and excluding the impact of the charge on the pending branch sale other noninterest expenses and noninterest income were within our expected ranges again id like to highlight as tim mentioned that this quarters results combined with the first quarter produced record net income for any sixmonth first sixmonth period in the history of the company we also continue to build our tangible book value per share during the first half of this year and as you can see on slide of our presentation deck weve grown tangible book value per share every year since weve been a public company going back to and were on track to do so again in so thats something were very proud of were excited about the future we have a solid balance sheet strong pipelines and it sets us up well for future growth in net interest income and with that i will turn it over to rich to talk about credit richard b murphy vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp thanks dave as tim and dave both noted credit performance continued to be very solid in the quarter as detailed in the earnings release loan growth for the quarter was billion or annualized net of the impact from the sale of million in premium finance loans this growth was driven by a number of factors commercial premium finance loans grew by million before the impact of the loan sale as noted in the past the second quarter is historically when we see our highest funding volumes in addition we continue to see the effects of a harder market for insurance premiums particularly for commercial properties resulting in higher average loan size finally we continue to see new opportunities as a result of a consolidation dislocation within the premium finance industry during the second quarter we also saw growth in core commercial loans which were up million driven largely by quality opportunities resulting from dislocation within the banking landscape in our primary markets we also saw good growth in our commercial real estate and leasing portfolios i would also note that we remain highly focused on getting paid appropriately for our risk as noted on slide average loan yields continue to increase up basis points during the quarter we believe that loan growth for the second half of will continue to be strong and aligned with our previous guidance of mid to high singledigits for a number of reasons last years third quarter volume for commercial premium finance loans was very strong we believe the hard market for insurance premiums should continue through year end in addition our core ci and leasing pipelines wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 remain very solid finally we saw core ci line utilization rates trending up from to quarterover quarter offsetting this growth would be continued pressure on the volume of new cre opportunities as higher borrowing costs have reduced loan demand in that area we believe that higher borrowing costs will continue to cause borrowers to reconsider the economics of new projects business expansion and equipment purchases in summary we continue to be optimistic about our ability to grow loans at attractive rates and maintain our credit discipline as noted earlier loan growth for the balance of should continue to be strong and within our guidance of mid to high singledigits from a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide we continue to see strong credit performance but with signs of normalization across the portfolio this can be seen in a number of ways nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans was up slightly from basis points to basis points this modest increase in npls was evidenced in both our core ci and cre portfolios and as noted on last quarters call we continue to see slightly lower but elevated levels of nonperforming loans in commercial premium finance portfolio resulting from ongoing stress in the transportation segment of that portfolio we continue to monitor this situation closely and we have started to see this trend stabilize as a result of tighter loan structures and enhanced underwriting higher yields and late charges from this segment of the portfolio continue to offset our credit losses chargeoffs for the quarter were million or basis points up from million or basis points in  these chargeoffs resulted primarily from loans within our core cre ci and commercial premium finance portfolio our portfolio continues to be very solid welldiversified and very granular evidence of this can be seen on slide where we saw stable levels in our special mention and substandard loans we believe that this quarters level of npls and chargeoffs reflect a return to a more normalized credit environment as evidenced by the chart of historical nonperforming asset levels on slide finally we are firmly committed to identifying problems early and charging them down where appropriate our goal as always is to stay ahead of any credit challenges as noted in our last few earnings calls we continue to be highly focused on our exposure to commercial real estate loans which comprise roughly one quarter of the total portfolio however higher borrowing costs and pressure on occupancy and lease rates continue to affect cre valuations particularly in the office category as detailed on slide we saw a modest increase during the second quarter in cre npls from to we also saw an uptick in the level of cre chargeoffs as we continue to proactively address and rightsize our more challenged credits on slide we continue to provide enhanced detail in our cre and cre office exposure currently this portfolio remains steady at billion or of our total cre portfolio and only of our total loan portfolio of the billion of office exposure is medical office or owneroccupied the average loan size of our the average sizable loan in the office portfolio is only million and we have only seven loans above million and only four which are nonmedical or owner occupied we perform portfolio reviews regularly on our cre portfolio and we stay very engaged with our borrowers as mentioned on prior calls our cre credit team regularly updates their deep dive analysis of every nonowner occupied loan over million which will be renewing between now and the end of the first quarter of this analysis which covered of all nonowner occupied cre loans maturing during this period resulted in the following of the loans reviewed will clearly qualify for renewal at prevailing rates roughly of these loans are anticipated to be paid off or require a shortterm extension at prevailing rates and the remaining loans will require some additional attention which could include a pay down or pledge of additional collateral wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 we continue to back check the results of these tests conducted during prior quarters and have found that projected outcomes versus actual outcomes were very tightly correlated and generally speaking borrowers of loans deemed to require additional attention continue to support their loans by providing enhancements including principal reductions as we have stated on prior calls our portfolio is not immune from the effects of rising rates or the market forces behind lease rates but we continue to proactively identify weaknesses in the portfolio and work with our borrowers to identify the best possible outcomes we believe that our portfolio is in reasonably good shape appropriately reserved and situated to weather the challenges ahead that concludes my comments on credit and now ill turn it back to tim timothy s crane president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks rich to wrap up our prepared remarks and youve heard me say this on prior calls we continue to believe that were wellpositioned in some cases uniquely positioned in our markets to take advantage of the current environment with our diverse businesses the growth this quarter was evidence of that and while we wouldnt necessarily expect to see this sort of loan growth going forward we continue to be very encouraged by the solid pipelines as dave discussed we believe the margin will be relatively stable in the second half of the year given the current rate assumptions with the growth this quarter and the solid pipelines we believe that continued net interest income growth is likely in the second half of this year with respect to our pending acquisition of macatawa bank there have been good conversations and planning regarding the integration and the many benefits financial and otherwise associated with the transaction we remain very impressed with their team and the opportunities that we will have together we received fed approval for the transaction on june 17th that was quick in todays environment about days from application which we think reflects the relative strength of both organizations and our strong track record regarding acquisitions youll recall macatawa serves the greater grand rapids west michigan market which is a top msa in the united states they have solid credit quality a low loantodeposit ratio and a very attractive low cost deposit book the loantodeposit ratio is approximately which translates to approximately billion in excess deposits macatawa has scheduled their special shareholder meeting to consider approval of the transaction for july 31st and we would expect to close the transaction shortly after they receive their final shareholder approval of course after closing we will provide additional information on the related financial entries with our next quarterly results at this point ill pause and we can take some questions wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning good morning question for either rich or tim on the kind of the nearterm i guess the near term loan growth expectations i mean this quarter was stronger than i thought it would be and obviously drove some of the provisioning as well but what kind of a pullback do you expect in the third quarter and just if theres anything else you would call out in terms of the second quarter activity richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp well as i point out the second quarter is very affected by what happens in the pc portfolio and we knew that was coming we talked about it at the end of the first quarter that definitely gets tempered in the third quarter but as i pointed out were still seeing really nice core opportunities in our primary markets so i would say that we would probably be at the upper end of our range for the back half of the year certainly in the fourth quarter youre going to see pc slow down quite a bit if you look back at our historic funding patterns fourth quarter is probably one of the lower ones so third quarter will be very strong as i said well probably be at the upper end of the range timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah jon the only thing id add is the loan growth was broad based obviously exaggerated by the pc business but really in all our material categories we saw growth and particularly some strong growth in the ci side of things which i think is a function of strong market position on our part and to richs point a little bit more utilization so whether that continues to be a tailwind or not i dont know jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thank you on that rich on the chargeoff levels i think you used the term normalization anything you would call out in the second quarter it looks like the commercial real estate chargeoffs were a bit higher but anything else unusual rolling around in there and you expect this its hard to say a run rate but is this more normal for you richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp no i mean its interesting when i was looking at the slides ph look at slide where we have the commercial real estate chargeoffs it does pop up quite a bit and i would point out that we had a number of cre wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 credits that were particularly challenged that we just got ahead of and just there were a number of different stories there but if you look back to june i mean we were at basis points and so its just in the cre space its just lumpy we dont necessarily anticipate that we would see a similar third quarter in chargeoffs in cre but you just dont necessarily know we would look at that substandard and criticized page and just point out that youre really not seeing a lot of movement so its just these you have we dont like to use the term episodic but sometimes it is were just a primary tenant of a property you lose it and its tough to replace and there could be just these types of issues that affect that but generally speaking i mean it doesnt feel like  is all that different other than some of these signs of normalization when you look at that chart that we point out in terms of historical npls we were at such a low level that its just these numbers feel a little out of sort but if you take a look at a broader 10year history i mean were still at a very reasonable level in terms of chargeoffs than npls jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay good and then i guess last one your philosophy at this point and based on what youre seeing is to try to hold the reserve percentage relatively stable is that fair david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well certainly wed like that to happen but jon this is dave cecl sort of drives that result now we show in our deck provisioning has always sort of been higher than our chargeoffs over the last year or so so weve been building reserves and i think that thats what the cecl model said was that potentially could have more problematic economic times going forward to a slight extent and so weve built more reserves and whether that happens or not some of those economic factors recently have been getting a little bit better and not as problematic so we have built the reserves i think if you kind of look at the provisioning weve had some people say well what should the provision be going forward and cecl sort of says youve got to book your reserves based upon the back pattern at that point in time for the life of the loan going forward so future provisioning would really sort of look at loan growth and obviously this quarter we had really strong loan growth so that added to the provision and then just sort of the normal chargeoff levels and i mean if you look at the last three quarters our provisioning has averaged about million so probably not a bad place to start we would think that that would exceed chargeoffs again and build reserves but one of those quarters was in the million range and one was a little bit more than what we had this quarter so it fluctuates a little bit sort of based upon the growth and the economic factors but probably from a provisioning standpoint million sort of plus or minus depending on growth and economic conditions or if we see any changes in the classified and other characteristics of the portfolio which we arent as rich said its very encouraging to us that classified loans substandard or special mention those percentages are holding stable and actually if you look at the nearterm delinquencies that we show in the earnings release those are actually down this quarter from last quarter so were not seeing anything systemic out there so as rich said the episodic nature of a couple of smaller deals added to it but probably barring macroeconomic changes or something else if youre sort of in the mid plus or minus thats probably a decent estimate of what provisioning would be going forward and obviously weve been higher and lower than that based on economic factors but i think that would mean that reserves would continue to build or stay stable longwinded indiscernible wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay very helpful what was that dave sorry david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp longwinded answer so i apologize for that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thank you guys i appreciate it timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah thanks jon operator thank you our next question comes from the line of casey haire of jefferies casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks good morning everyone timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc a couple of questions on the nim i guess first on the funding strategy your cds obviously drove a lot of the growth this quarter just wondering do you guys is there youre at of the deposit stack is there a limit that you dont is there a limit as to how high you want that to go and then what are your cd operates today timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well obviously to the extent that cds are your more expensive funding source youd prefer to have fewer but its not too recent history when those could have made up of somebodys book so i dont think we have a specific number but weve shortened most of our promotional cd offering cd offerings and their plus or minus and what i can tell you is that the offerings from approximately a year ago that are now renewing are renewing at lower levels and so we think there is some rationalization of the pricing to clients that we acquire with these promotional rates but we were committed to funding the loan growth with core deposit growth this quarter and weve done that and weve acquired a lot of new customers which we expect will be with us for a long time casey haire q analyst jefferies llc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 okay and then on the loan side of things so loan yields are up bps to is the premium finance sort of the lag on that repricing is that now digested and just wondering what kind of cadence we can expect in terms of loan yield lift going forward david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i think it pretty well as you said digested casey i mean if you look at both of those portfolios within a year they generally turn over and prime hasnt risen in about a year now i think were pretty much through with those rate increases we do have back book other fixed rate loans in the commercial real estate area and some leasing loans etcetera that will reprice up but we still think therell be a slight lift in the loan yields and even on the deposit side both of those i would say we probably think probably singledigit basis point increases in loans and deposits next quarter so we again expect the margin to stay around so were managing that and even if theres a rate cut of basis points or to the rest of this year we still think we can hold the margin casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay all right great and just last one sorry if i missed this but did you guys provide a spot nim at david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp we didnt but we ended last quarter at the range and this whole quarter averaged so the low is where were at so casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you thank you timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp you bet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy of stephens timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi thanks for taking my question hi good morning just a quick one here to start was there a gain in all recorded on the million loan sale wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i mentioned that a little bit in my comments i didnt give the number so we sold roughly million of those loans and had a gain of a little over million you recall last the last quarter or last year when we sold the loans it was a little over million the pricing the funding cost of those have really really come in and the spreads are tighter so about a million a little over million gain on that sale but you have to remember terry that that really just ph present valuing back the cash flows on those loans and recording the gain had we kept them on our balance sheet we obviously over the next two quarters would have recorded more net interest income but we thought it was prudent to sell them from like i said liquidity loantodeposit and capital purposes and those loans come back on the book pretty quickly that sale of that million we would have earned money on those from an interest income perspective in the third and the fourth quarters but by the end of the year that portfolio will have substantially been replaced so terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks for that dave and then within your margin outlook could you help us maybe understand what youre assuming for interest bearing deposit costs in the second half of the year and essentially whats the cost to fund that loan growth and maybe just as a follow up there youve got youve got billion of cds maturing in the back half of this year i think it was a rate what are you seeing when those cds mature are they rolling into market rate products or somewhere else timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp both is the answer to your last question some clients are rolling into cds but as i mentioned were shortening the term of the promotional cds and so youre also seeing clients roll into new money market offerings which are closer to than and so well have to work hard to retain this cd volume and that would again continue to allow us to roughly match deposit and loan growth going forward sorry give me the first part of your question again terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc just interest bearing deposit costs in the second half of this year they were up obviously in  to fund the loan growth what do you think they will do over the next two quarters timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah i think this was the big quarter in terms of movement on the interest bearing deposit cost that we had some larger deposits from when rates were substantially lower roll off and so to daves point i think were going to see a much more muted change in the interest bearing deposit costs something that kind of should be similar to what happens to loan yields david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp again we think therell be a singledigit basis point raises in both those categories wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc perfect thanks for taking my questions timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp you bet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty of kbw christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great good morning dave just going back to the nii guide the linkedquarter is about is there an acceleration in the nii growth in the back half of the year relative to this quarters change given the growth that you got this quarter or is it mitigated by a little bit of nim pressure david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no we think the nim is going to hold fairly stable chris i think that the drive will be the earning asset growth and really why we believe we can grow nii is that we do think the margin can be held stable here and itll be growth in the loans so we had a great growth quarter so thats going to carry over into the second half of the year and as rich said were at the high end of our mid to high singledigit range and so if were at the high end of that it should accelerate more i would think christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then i guess looking out i mean the markets fairly fickle but right now the markets thinking were going to get four or five cuts over the next year relative to that youve talked about i know youre a lot less asset sensitive than youve been but how much downside to margin do you see if the curve plays out david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well i think were looking at this year that maybe we have one to two cuts and next year whether its five cuts or whatever whichever forecast you think is out there i mean if we look at that we still feel pretty confident that we can keep our margin in the low to mid so say to it just sort of depends on the speed of those and the magnitude of those but weve done a lot of hedging to protect that downside and i think wed probably be in that range so i mean if we have or cuts theres probably going to be some stress because youre going to lose on the spread on your free money etcetera so i think therell be some pressure there but we think we can hold it in that to range based on the current consensus estimate and how to manage it christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect and then the tax rate looks a little high this quarter is this a trueup or is this indiscernible wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well you guys are all pretty sharp on picking out things yeah its up a little bit this quarter its kind of nuanced but the state of illinois passed a law that changed the way the apportionment is treated for investment securities and that will benefit us going forward in future quarters but we had to revalue our deferred tax inventory because of the change in the law so that bumped the rate up a little bit in the past weve thought generally our tax rate was more in the range barring any unusual items in the quarter we think thats probably closer now to so we should pick up close to in our tax rate going forward so one of the few times that the tax law changes in the state of illinois have benefited us but we had to revalue our deferred tax inventory which increased the tax rate a little bit christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks dave operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brendan nosal of hovde group brendan nosal q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning folks hope youre doing well timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp morning brendan nosal q analyst hovde group llc maybe just to start off here could you maybe unpack the trigger points for any additional loan sales in the future im guessing if it was to happen it would probably be in a seasonally strong quarter like this one for the premium finance business david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well i think thats right i mean i touched on it generally but weve been running that loantodeposit we really dont care to run much higher than that and wed like to fund the loans with core deposits and we obviously had an extraordinarily strong quarter here we had billion of deposit growth and we just would rather not have that loantodeposit ratio go up or and we want to keep appropriate levels of liquidity and capital so its a nice relief valve for us when we have that stronger growth and well use it judiciously because wed rather have the assets on our books but weve got to keep those other three metrics in mind i think and we need to be disciplined on the liquidity capital planning and follow our playbook timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah and id just add its a relatively attractive asset to do this with because they turn very quickly as dave described a few minutes ago and again after roughly year end those loans could be back on our books wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah so yeah to tims point i mean we sold about million of that but the average balance is substantially less than that because they pay off so fast so the rule of thumb is you divide it roughly by and that would be your average balance and so because they pay off so quickly so its a great asset class as tim says to sell and get back on your books quickly brendan nosal q analyst hovde group llc yeah indiscernible dave one more for me within the wealth business i guess i was a little surprised to see aum just tick down a little bit quarteroverquarter given how strong markets were in the second quarter im just kind of curious what trends youre seeing in that business and what underlying momentum looks like david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah it wasnt anything unusual per se a couple of clients moved money around to different options but we would expect that to grow in the third quarter so wasnt substantial change brendan nosal q analyst hovde group llc all right fantastic thanks for taking the questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff rulis of da davidson jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning maybe just timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co hi i think you mentioned last quarter you saw some really some targeted opportunities in office still despite sort of the national rhetoric and i think you mentioned sort of where higher tenanted or medical wanted to kind of check to see if thats still the case do you still see opportunities i mean the nonperforming loan ticked up a little bit there but appetite for office just wanted to check in on how youre feeling richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah its obviously were very careful in that space because of all the dynamics that we talk about but we did another office deal this quarter of some reasonable size not huge but where you have a investment grade tenant building and we got really good pricing we got great structure and because no one else everybody else wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 has got a probably over allocated towards that space were not so again want to be very thoughtful want to be very careful but there are still really good deals out there and our job is always weve talked about this in the past is never do have to jerk the wheel never to overreact and if there are opportunities out there we want to be taking advantage of those but were not looking to bulk up on them we tell our people all the time its like if theres a because theres almost limitless numbers of opportunities that you could do here our job is to really just pick and choose between those that are just cant find a home and those that are really really great opportunities so yes we continue to be open for business but very very picky jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay and rich i missed the cre review bucket you referenced was that maturing in a certain timeframe just what was that figure again or that you indiscernible richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah so what we do and weve done this for a number quarters is to we really want to focus about whats ahead of us and try to think about over the next several quarters so what we do is a threequarter rolling review of what were expecting and what we try to do is identify where we may have some challenges where theres just lease pressures have been more pronounced or the higher borrowing costs are really affecting that and we may have to ask the borrower to curtail the outstanding balance so we look at every loan over million thats coming due in those threequarter period and we just keep track of it and the thing that as i pointed out in my comments thats interesting to me is just those numbers have been pretty consistent in terms of those loans that are going to require attention but i think even more importantly is just as we move forward that we have not seen a huge amount of really any materiality in terms of those borrowers who havent supported their properties so its a way for us to kind of look ahead and make sure that we understand whats coming down the pike and address it as prudently as we can jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co sure so thats a pretty tight timeframe and i would imagine as youve undergone that analysis in past quarters thats reflective of the current rate environment so i mean not to get i guess the confidence in that as youve rolled that the fact that the statistics have stayed similar that gives you a pretty good read on credit that nothings upcoming is that fair richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah thats exactly right and thats our way because our job is to try to get ahead of stuff before it washes up and so this is our way of doing that not always perfect but generally it gives you a pretty good understanding as to what youre going to look at the other thing we theres a lot of has been said about like maturity walls we look at the maturities pending over the next two years twoandahalf years and we just dont have that its a very consistent number thats coming due quartertoquarter and so again our job is just to try to look forward as much as we can and try to get in front of those borrowers and make sure that were all aligned in terms of what the outcome is wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co appreciate it and one quick last one tim it sounds like the macatawa in terms of two pretty good institutions and that timing sounds like a third quarter close i always come in late but theres no sort of community issues cropping up with that transaction as youve heard timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp we received approval on june the primary process includes a comment period prior to approval so no we continue to believe that not only do we serve our communities well but they do as well jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co great appreciate it thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david long of raymond james timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hey dave david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone hows it going timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good a lot of talk about the net interest margin here and the sticking around the range as you think about macatawa adding macatawa how will that impact the net interest margin and is that part of that sort of outlook for the next couple of quarters and maintaining that david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no the were talking about right now is our current organization were not trying to blend in the macatawa with it but dave if you think about it macatawa is about of our asset base they have publicly available data and theyre a publicly traded company so people can look at the qs well go through purchase accounting and revalue all those assets and liabilities to current market value but once you go through all of that we think therell be a slight lift to the margin but because of the size of it relative to the size of wintrust its not going to be dramatic its going to be positive most things about macatawa we think are going to be positive for the organization as far as growth and culture and margins et cetera but we havent disclosed exactly what that number is one theyve got a shareholder vote coming up and we just dont want to try to get out in front of that wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 and tout this thing ahead of their shareholder vote but we think it should be marginally beneficial but not materially just because the size aspect of it but as you know theyve got a fair amount of excess liquidity that we can use since our a little over loantodeposit we can take those funds and put them into higher yielding loans fairly quickly so we think that will be beneficial too david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you for the color and then the followup question i have relates to deposits and there seems to be some bit of a resurgence in savings rates in the chicago msa seeing some rates pretty high and guaranteed for the next six months what are you seeing on deposit competition specifically in the chicago market and are you seeing a bit of an increase timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp subjectively i would say its more or less stable david i mean weve been seeing call it months to month type rates of around the only surprise i guess that i would have personally is that some people have longer terms out there than others i think were thinking that those rates should be and down here going forward but again our competitors sometimes do strange stuff david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks guys appreciate you taking my questions timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp you bet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of nathan race of piper sandler nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi guys good morning thanks for taking my questions timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning nate yeah nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co going back to the margin discussion i appreciate the commentary around youre still being a holder around even after the fed cuts begin im just curious within that context in terms of how much you guys have it as it relates to kind of rate sensitive deposits that can kind of reprice one for one following each cut richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 well i mean if you look at our disclosures roughly of our deposits are not cds so everything other than cds and noninterest bearing deposits are fair game as far as being able to reduce the rates quickly and it would be our intention that if the fed moves on those money market savings accounts and even cds that we would cut the rates fairly immediately cds would take a while to work their way through but as tim said weve done fairly short maturities on those recently so its not going to take too long for those to work their way through so lets say youve got of them if you take out noninterest bearing at and you take out cds just under you got of them that wont price immediately but you got another that you have the ability to do that with and we think we would be active in doing so timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah nate and as a reminder we really dont have indexed deposits either some of our municipal deposits are sort of tied to a reference rate which is actually trending down a little bit prior to the fed even cutting so thats not going to move the number a ton but were watching it carefully nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great very helpful changing gears a little bit we heard from another chicagoland institution this morning that theres some increase in ma chatter lately im curious if i imagine these are likely smaller deals id imagine those are ph of interest to you guys just given the size of the company today or if you guys are still kind of entertaining some smaller scale acquisitions these days timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well we think were good in terms of acquisition activity we think weve demonstrated an ability to do it well the macatawa deal is billion or billion we think thats about the right size we would certainly look at smaller deals if they made sense in terms of branch overlap where you would get more favorable economics from some sort of cost takeout or if there was a strategic market we felt like we needed to be in but i think the right range for us is million to pick a number several billion dollars we just want good culture good companies where we can do integration in markets that we can expand so i dont know if that helps nate or not but nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah no thats great color thanks tim one last one the gainonsale margin came down versus the to a considerable degree any thoughts on just how the gain on sale margin may trend in the and indiscernible david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp its down a little bit but its still i mean if you look at the range weve been from the low sort of the weve been from to i would expect us to be in the to range going forward nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great i appreciate all the color thanks guys wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah thanks nate operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of jared shaw of barclays timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hi good morning morning most of my questions were answered but i guess as we look at capital especially cet1 what should we be thinking about as sort of a target level for that for you is that something that we should be expecting to sort of be growing higher closer to peers or are you comfortable with it here david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well i think were comfortable where its at obviously a couple of things id say there jared we also have leverage in our capital stack we do use preferred securities as capital which count as tier theyre just not common equity tier we would expect to grow continue to grow that number over time here because our earnings generally are outstripping our capital this quarter was a little unique given the strong strong growth but we would expect to grow that and get that over here in a reasonably short period of time but the limiting factor for us tends to be total riskbased capital in the past and we ph man into that and if you look in the slide deck on slide that was down a little bit this quarter but part of that decrease one was just the extraordinarily strong growth but two we did pay off some subdebt this quarter which didnt count as capital but we also had another subdebt issue where were into the sort of the amortization period of how the capital is so we lost of the remaining subdebt capital treatment and so that will but that will stay flat until we get to next june where we lose another of accounting so that accounted for roughly onetenth of decline in the capital ratios and if you take that out of the equation capital ratio stayed relatively flat and going forward we expect the earnings would outstrip the growth and we would just continue to grow that number but we also have a little bit more we acknowledge this we have a little bit more leverage in our capital stack our preferred securities are relatively cheap in this environment and they count as tier capital and permanent until we decide to redeem them so happy to have that capital structure right now but understanding that we need to get the cet1 probably over sometime in the reasonably near future jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks thats great color and then maybe just finally when you look at the chargeoffs on commercial real estate whats been like the average valuation decline on cre that youve seen especially on the office david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 its such a small population that its really hard to kind of draw a number there but its not insignificant but every deal is just a little bit different depending on location and existing tenancy and how effective it is its just i would hate to throw a number out there because there its just the range is so big jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc but nothing thats causing you concern more broadly david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well i mean any anytime you have declining valuations i mean its not a good situation so but i mean nothing thats like massively draconian i mean its something that every again every situation is a little bit different just depending on where its located and most importantly what the existing lease structure looks like i mean thats probably the most profound thing that affects them and generally speaking we havent had again the nature of our portfolio is a little bit unique there because were not looking at super large projects so you tend to have more granularity in the tenant base as well so were not seeing huge but if you have one or two tenants in a building and you lose one of them i mean thats where youre seeing the most profound effects jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brandon king of truist brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey just a follow up on mortgage could you give us what your outlook is for the back half of the year and could you also give us some context as far as the trends you saw particularly in the late part of the quarter david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well as i said we were a little bit more optimistic last quarter that spring buying season would kick in and the second quarter was a little better than the first quarter you could see the numbers that we provided we had origination volumes in second quarter for sale of million versus million in the first quarter so a tick up there but we were hoping it would be a little bit stronger than that application volume has been fairly stable the last three or four months and we would expect that probably to stay relatively stable the rest of the third quarter here and then probably dip down in the fourth quarter just because of seasonality its generally fourth quarter and first quarter unless theres a big drop in rates the purchase activity slows down and our purchase activity is really roughly of our activity right now given the interest rate structure so we would expect that probably to be relatively flat in the third quarter and to probably dip a little on the fourth quarter unless we see the longerterm 30year mortgage rates come down dramatically which is not our base case right now richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah as we talked about last quarter too its not for lack of wants we have a lot of prequals that come in all the time the issue is really just inventory so i think people are looking at the mortgage rates and theyve been able wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 to digest the fact that theyre up dramatically over where they were a couple of years ago and people are looking to buy homes theres just not a whole lot of inventory out there and when there is a property that comes online its just there are multiple offers right away so thats probably the biggest challenge right now is just we are as dave said were purchaseoriented so if you cant find a home to buy you cant take out a mortgage david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp and the other thing id add and brandon this is dave again as you know the gross revenue on mortgage banking now is generally million to million once you pay out commissions and other expenses fluctuation in that line item the net effect after commissions other expenses taxes is not that dramatic and wed love it to go up and our teams are doing a good job of managing in this environment and we think doing a really good job in this environment but we just dont see it moving enough that its going to have a dramatic impact on the net income number of the company just because of the net profit on that we just dont see rates moving substantially enough to have a dramatic impact one way or the other brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got you so with those thoughts on inventory and the issues there would you say that mortgage could be less sensitive to decline in rates moving forward timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well i mean theres a sort of a dead zone here because youve got a lot of people with very low rates and so the beginning of rate decline may not produce a lot of activity but at some point you certainly progressively are going to pick up some volume its just a question of kind of when that happens and im reasonably certain that most mortgage originators know exactly where all of their clients rates are brandon king q analyst truist securities inc any sense you can give as to where that level is or is it kind of a moving target timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp again i think its evolutionary so you know or points would help but a lot of people have mortgages with a three handle on them and so youre going to have to get down to much lower levels before you get back to anywhere near what we saw four or five years ago david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i mean just i dont have a scientific answer to that brandon but our portfolio that we service the average rate on that is drifting up and is right around now where it used to be so i mean to get a lot of refis that have to go down dramatically but i think that there are people out there that when they had a to mortgage rate they werent going to go for the to rate but our gut is that if that rate got into the low or high that people would say hey i really want to get this new house ill go from to high i just wont go from to or to and so our gut is youd see a pickup if you got into the high or low but again theres got to be supply out there to buy too so i think that will mute it but certainly when rates came wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2024 down to the before we started to see a little bit of pickup in activity so i guess we would think that if you got into the low that would be quite helpful brandon king q analyst truist securities inc that is very very helpful thanks for taking my questions timothy s crane a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp you bet thank you operator thank you at this time id like to turn the call back over to tim crane for closing remarks sir timothy s crane president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah thanks
