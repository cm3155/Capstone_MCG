good morning everybody and welcome to our second quarter earnings call as mentioned with me are dave dykstra our chief operating officer dave stoehr our cfo kate boege our general counsel tim crane president and rich murphy vice chairman of credit were going to stick with the format we started in first quarter you dont have to listen to me as much youre going to listen to dave is going to talk more im going to give some general comments about our results dave dykstra will give us a detailed analysis of the income statement tim crane will talk about the balance sheet rich murphy will provide an overview of credit and back to me for some summary comments or thoughts about the future and of course time for questions last april at the start of the pandemic and the government massive response to it indiscernible zero interestrate environment i indicated wintrust support will be able to try to grow through it today weve accomplished this goal so so far so good same quarter shows the strategy is working the growth today has been all our growth today has been organic since that period of time second quarter was all around billion dollar id like to say assets deposits and core loans out of ppp loans grew by approximately billion plus or minus our growth prospects remain very good and income for the quarter totaled million or per common share yeartodate income was million or per common share our reported net interest margin grew basis points to while net interest income was up million in  if you were to back out the ppp loan income the nim grew basis points core loan growth and investment activity was at the end of the quarter this bodes well for quarter three period end loans exceeded average loans in the quarter by over million so we start  with a nice with that in our back pocket i said loan growth was excellent all pipeline and the pipelines in all our businesses remain very good its important to indiscernible alltime low about while normal averages closer to so we are going to back there we have billion of growth built in there credit quality got even better with net chargeoffs totaling basis points npls and npas reached down npls fell million to million or basis points our npas fell million to stand at basis points total assets this resulted in a reserve release of about million i keep saying credit cant get better it keeps getting better its hard to believe the mortgage is experiencing inevitable decline in the quarter dave will discuss this in detail it should be noted wealth management has been immune to this growth story assets under administration grew to billion or or annualized in the quarter indiscernible market and new business our wealth management assets now have totaled billion as compared to million we had at quarter one billion at the end of the prior year i will turn it to dave for review of the income statement timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp this is tim ill do the balance sheet maybe just for a second and then turn it over to dave as ed mentioned in the quarter assets grew billion to billion couple of items worth highlighting here first we experienced very strong core loan growth loans excluding ppp were up billion in the quarter growth was spread nicely across loan categories commercial real estate and our niche businesses rich will share a little more detail on a few minutes wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 on a percentage basis this billion equates to annualized growth and on a yeartodate basis our loan growth excluding ppp is just over annualized as ed mentioned we believe these growth numbers are solid and that during the quarter we continued to see a decline in utilization the trend in the coming quarters we hope to reverse and will help rather than hurt our loan growth activity in addition the pipelines remain strong as we see evidence of accelerating economic activity in our markets with respect to ppp loans we saw a reduction of billion as the forgiveness activity accelerated materially during the quarter total ppp loans at the end of the quarter were billion down from a peak of billion at the end of the first quarter for the remainder of the year we remain comfortable with our loan growth target of mid to highsingle digits on a percentage basis we could see upside with either improved line of credit utilization or continued strong market conditions deposit growth for the quarter was million the majority of the growth in noninterestbearing dda this represents annualized growth of nearly deposit costs continued to fall as we primarily repriced term deposits for the quarter the cost of interestbearing deposits fell an additional basis points to basis points a trend we expect to continue in the coming quarters notably the noninterestbearing dda deposits now comprise a third of our total deposits as weve noted in prior quarters were monitoring the significant deposit growth carefully however we view stable lowcost deposits as a strength of our company and well continue to grow those deposits related to client relationships obviously like many institutions we also remain very liquid with rates falling and at low levels for most of the quarter we held our securities position essentially stable during the quarter we remain cautious in our deployment of the excess liquidity wary of locking in low longterm yields we continue to evaluate our options and view the appropriate deployment of this liquidity as an opportunity in future periods given where we think volumes will land going forward we expect generally steady to improving net interest income in the coming quarters despite lower levels of ppp accretion and excluding ppp expect a generally steady net interest margin capital levels essentially held steady during the quarter with strong growth and remain appropriate given the conservative risk profile of the bank overall we remain well positioned to benefit from either stronger economic activity or higher rates or both as we enter the second half of the year dave david alan dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thanks tim as ed indicated ill cover the noteworthy income statement categories starting first with the net interest income for the second quarter of net interest income totaled million that was an increase of million as compared to the first quarter of and an increase of million as compared to the second quarter of last year the million increase in net interest income compared to the first quarter was primarily due to earning asset growth which was up over the prior quarter net interest margin expansion and one additional day in the second quarter and for your reference one additional day approximates million of net interest income for wintrust the net interest margin improved basis points from the prior quarter to as the rate on interestbearing liabilities declined basis points in the second quarter as compared to the prior quarter and a 4basispoint increase on the yield on earning assets was partially offset by a 2basispoint decline in our net prefunds contribution the 4basispoint improvement on the yield on earning assets was comprised of a 3basispoint increase on the yield on loans and a 13basispoint increase in the yield on liquidity management assets due to the appointment of a portion of our liquidity into investment securities late in the first quarter the decrease in the wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was primarily due to a 7basispoint decrease on the rate paid on interest bearing deposits and primarily due to the lower repricing of time deposits ppp fee accretion as we noted in the press release was million of recognition in the second quarter compared to million in the first quarter of as forgiveness activity accelerated during the quarter and additionally as tim noted the margin was again affected by excess liquidity on the balance sheet and we believe that the deployment of such liquidity when market conditions improve will be a tailwind to our net interest margin turning to provision for credit losses similar to many other banks that have reported this quarter wintrust recorded a negative provision for credit losses of million compared to a directionally similar negative provision of million in the prior quarter and million provision expense recorded on the yearago quarter the negative provision was driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses primarily due to improvements in macroeconomic forecasts including improvements in the commercial real estate price index and the baa corporate credit spreads additionally company saw improvement in the loan portfolio characteristics during the quarter including decreases in covid19related loan modifications and improving loan risk rating migration slide through of the presentation deck that we provided on our website will give you additional details about the improvement in the nonperforming loans the covid19 modified loans and the macroeconomic factors impacting the allowance for credit losses and rich will cover credit quality in a lot more detail in just a few minutes turning to noninterest income and the noninterest expense and the income tax sections in the noninterest income portion of the income statement our wealth management revenue increased million to another record level of million in the second quarter compared to million in the first quarter and net revenue sources up from the million recorded in the yearago quarter this revenue source has been positively impacted by higher equity valuations which impact the pricing on our managed asset accounts turning to mortgage banking revenue we recently saw loan origination volume during the second quarter but that origination volume was off the record high levels seen in the past few quarters due to lower refinance activity in the marketplace to that end the company originated approximately billion of mortgage loans for sale on the second quarter of down from the approximately billion in each of the prior quarter in the second quarter of last year mortgage banking revenue decreased to million for the second quarter as compared to million in the first quarter of contributing to the million reduction in revenue for the following items a million decline in revenue related to the impact of the msr valuation and the msr capitalization net of pay offs and pay downs the million negative impact of the value of the mortgage servicing rights primarily related to a positive fair value adjustment of million in the first quarter of the year as compared to a decrease of million in the current quarter as well as a decrease in the value of capitalization of retained mortgage servicing rights due to decline in loans sold with servicing retained another million reduction was due to reduced gain on sale primarily associated with the aforementioned lower production volume and a million decline due to secondary marketing gains and marktomarket impact of declining interest rate lock commitment pipelines our pipeline was smaller at the end of the second quarter than the first quarter first quarter of also benefited from atypical elevated levels of secondary marketing gains related to the market environment in the first quarter where we had strong investor demand general margin enhancement due to historically strong consumer demand and the timing associated with recognized gains on hedging trades in the prior quarter the normalization of that market drove a quarterly swing to a more typical range of secondary gains in the second quarter wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 looking forward based on the current pipeline activity we expect mortgage originations for sale in the third quarter to be very similar to slightly less than the origination volumes we experienced in the second quarter and the mortgage revenue excluding any msr valuation adjustments to be roughly in line with the second quarter or in the mid50 million range however i should note that although the aforementioned revenue estimate for the third quarter is expected to be in line with the second quarter the operating expenses should trend lower in the third quarter as many of you know we essentially record the net mortgage revenue when we lock the interest rate commitment on the majority of loans that we expect to originate and sell accordingly expense reductions lag the revenue recognition as we still need to underwrite process and close those loans that are in the pipeline as well as pay commissions once the loans close since the mortgage loans in the pipeline were substantially higher at the end of the first quarter the expenses associated with processing and closing that pipeline naturally lagged into the second quarter and lagged the drop off in revenue as the pipeline of loans has decreased during the second quarter we would expect to see a corresponding decrease in mortgagerelated expenses in the third quarter so currently assuming the mid50 million range of revenue excluding any msr valuation we anticipate mortgagerelated noninterest expenses to decline further in the third quarter in the million range i should note that when you evaluate the mortgage expenses relatives to the mortgage revenue decline you should consider that million of the msr valuation decline of million related to the secondary marketing gains and decline in the pipeline or million in aggregate of revenue decline would not have any associated expense reduction so those amount are simply valuation measurements so the expense reductions really follow through with the production decline of million so our mortgage expense reductions in the first quarter were generally million to million of commission reductions a couple of million dollars of other expense reductions and then we expected an additional million of expense reductions in the third quarter with that being said i have to caveat that in the last few days the interest rates have dropped considerably and the pipeline of new applications has increased if that continues we would expect the mortgage revenue to be higher than what i just guided and expenses associated with that revenue would also guide a little higher than what i just said but we should be able to lock in that net million of additional profitability on that production decline in revenue that we saw also i should note that wild card always at the msr valuation adjustment and its tied to interest rates and were not going to speculate on where rates will be at the end of the third quarter and so those amounts that i just talked about would be exclusive of the msrs other noninterest income totaled million in the second quarter and was up million from the million recorded in the prior quarter the primary reason for that increase was a million gain on the sale of two branch locations in south western wisconsin that previously disclosed transaction closed during the second quarter in the noninterest expense categories noninterest expenses totaled million down approximately million or from the million recorded in the prior quarter there are a handful of categories that account for the majority of the change from the prior quarter that ill focus on wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 first salaries and employee benefits expense decreased by million in the second quarter compared to the first quarter the million decline is primarily related to million of lower commissions and incentive comp primarily related to the decline in commissions related to the lower mortgage originations that i just talked about occupancy expense totaled million in the first quarter decreasing million from the million recorded in the prior quarter that decrease was primarily the result of the first quarter of the year including a million impairment charge associated with the planned closure of a branch location and the current quarter having a lower level of maintenance and recurring expense similar to recent years other than which was impacted by the pandemic marketing expenses increased by approximately million from the first quarter to million as weve discussed on previous calls this category of expenses increased as our corporate sponsorships tend to be higher in the second and third quarter of the year due primarily to our marketing efforts related to various major and minor league baseball sponsorships as well as sponsorship of summer time events held in the communities that we serve so other than those expense categories that i discussed all other expense categories in the aggregate were up by less than million compared to the first quarter and nothing noteworthy to discuss moving on to income tax expense the effective tax rate in the first quarter was approximately which is in the to range that we would normally expect so nothing significant there to talk about so in summary other than the nuance associated with the normalizing mortgage market and the undesirable swing in the msr valuation the core fundamentals were strong with robust loan and deposit growth increased net interest margin improved credit quality record wealth management revenue and lower expenses so with that i will conclude my comments and turn it over to rich murphy richard b murphy vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp thanks dave as noted earlier credit performance for the quarter was very solid from a number of perspectives loan growth net of ppp was billion and this growth was across the portfolio but a couple of areas really stood out first insurance funding where we financed commercial insurance premiums grew by million an outstanding quarter which was the result of a number of new larger relationships a hardening market which took our average premium up to from in the first quarter and the continued popularity of financing insurance premiums due to lower interest rates and wintrust life finance grew by million or annualized as we have seen this product grow by over billion over the past year as more people are looking at life insurance as a key part of their estate plan and the market allows them to finance the product at historically low rates from a core loan perspective commercial loans excluding ppp grew by million or annualized most of which closed at the very end of the quarter and commercial real estate loans grew by million or annualized as well a couple of additional notes on loan growth pipeline levels continue to look very strong the total core pipeline is approximately billion and consistent with what we saw in  and as ed and tim pointed out while we are pleased with the overall level of core loan growth we think that this number is muted by the line of the level of line utilization which fell to in  compared to prepandemic levels in the upper range this lower utilization resulted in funded balances being reduced by approximately billion wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 id also like to point out the granularity within the portfolio as we have talked about in prior quarters one of the keys to our credit portfolio has been diversification across a number of product lines this quarter was a great example of that strategy while we continue to have a good consistent growth from our core portfolio our niche products have allowed us to grow the overall portfolio well ahead of projections in addition slide details the geographic diversification in our portfolio as we have stated before wintrust trust will always have a chicago milwaukee nexus however as this slide illustrates our various product lines provides us with a meaningful amount of credit opportunities outside of our primary markets from a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide we continue to see meaningful improvement in credit performance across the portfolio as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic this can be seen in a number of metrics nonperforming to reduce from million at the end of  to million at the end of the second quarter this is roughly half the level of npls we saw at the end of the third quarter of we recorded million of net charge offs during the quarter which was down from million in the previous quarter this is a very good quarter from a charge off perspective and helped by a number of recoveries primarily out of the first insurance funding portfolio we also saw a reduction of over40 in covid19 modified loans from million to million during the quarter as outlined on slide the majority of these remaining modified loans are primarily in our select highrisk impact industries and credit ratings continue to show meaningful positive migration as our customers continue to recover finally on ppp as outlined on slide we funded billion to more than different businesses through the ppp program we cannot be happier with the results from this program and the positive effects that our customers and community it was an enormous team effort and we are so proud of the employees of wintrust who made it possible were now focused on working with our customers to process their applications for forgiveness this is proceeding very well as we have now processed forgiveness applications on over of our ppp loans and over of those loans have received their final forgiveness decision that concludes my comments and ill turn it back to ed to wrap up edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks rich as i mentioned at the beginning of the call our strategy throughout this has been to grow the balance sheet during this period of low rates use our structural hedges like mortgages to buffer the loss of the net interest income till such time as a balance sheet growth can offset the income loss due to the lower rates ppp loans were an expected benefit addon to this strategy all of the above was the accomplishment while enhancing our asset sensitivity position anticipation and eventual higher rates balance sheet growth for the year asset grow to billion and core loan growth of billion excluding loans held for sale and ppp weve experienced all of this as tim laid out has been done on a totally organic basis the acquisition market which has been sleeping today appears to be picking up based upon the amount of inbound calls weve received lately sellers will have a rather higher expectations so were going to see where all this ends up as rich said loan pipelines remain extremely strong in all our major categories our asset sensitivity position is where we want it we continue the leg into our investment of our excess liquidity take advantage of market blips wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 indiscernible the lousy longterm rates does make a lot of sense to us credit is remarkably good thanks to our consistently conservative credit standards diversified loan portfolio both our lending line and credit folks npas npls are lower than they were before the start of the pandemic all major areas delivering strong results and assets under administration continue to grow so todate the plan is working we need to continue in order to bring this plan to total fulfillment organic growth should remain strong well take advantage of the opening of the acquisition market if it actually makes some sense indiscernible offset any reduction in ppp loans and we seem to be doing that i think that at the end of the day if we get another billion loan growth quarter and by the end of the year we should have made up for the ppp loans which should actually help our margin to some extent our net interest income so basically we feel very good about where we are right now the plan as is achieving what weve set out to achieve and we continue to take what the market gives us and with that i turn over to some questions thank you question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question is coming from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks for the help on some of the expectations here and depending on mortgage and nii and expenses and i did want to ask on loan growth tim you talked about accelerating economic activity and then rich you talked about a little bit higher commercial at the end of the quarter im curious what you guys are seeing outside of the premium finance businesses in terms of some of the growth potential there is it spreading to broaden out and then just the sustainability of the premium finance growth as well timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah ill take the course question first so i think that we are seeing our customers feeling much better about the prospects going into the back half of the year i think confidence on them has really improved dramatically i think there are obviously some headwinds that are making people nervous i think labor availability is an issue and obviously the uptick in covid cases has people a little bit anxious but overall i think were feeling pretty good about where our existing customers are and i think well see line utilization increase as we go into the back half of the year wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 and as weve talked about in the past jon the concept of becoming chicagos bank has really started to happen i mean we really feel like at this point in time we are a goto bank in terms of new opportunities the pipelines are very good and i think well continue to bring more customers on as a result of the disruption thats been in the market the most recent announcement as it relates to first midwest helps us as well so were pretty confident about where core loan growth might be going into the back half of the year as it relates to first insurance i think the hard market is not going away anytime soon i think that as you see the team the pc side has done a very good job of bringing in new relationships you got the indiscernible market you really have a lot of good strong momentum there and the life side similarly we had anticipated that things were going to begin slowing down in the back half of the year but in talking with that team as recently as yesterday theyre also feeling very good about where the back half of the year could go so again were not changing our guidance but were feeling pretty comfortable right now that momentum will continue at least through year end jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp we have to thank president biden for talking about estate planning and estate taxes in that regard so at least hes doing something right for us jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thats good thats good question for you dave this is a more difficult question but when you think about the mortgage line and i know theres a lot that goes into it but the business really took off when the pandemic hit and when you look at some of the numbers prior to the pandemic it was in this million a quarter range and im just wondering if theres anything materially different about your business today than where it was pre pandemic other than rates just obviously what im trying to get at is just longerterm expectations of the business so anything you can do to help us out on that id appreciate david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well i think the mix between veterans first and the retailers has been fairly stable the refi volume has obviously dropped off a little bit although with this recent drop i think that it looks like that may be picking up a little bit where people are bouncing back in but longer term i think we have better technology and we have better tools to reach people than just guys hitting the street physically and those tools help those guys that are hitting the street physically to serve their customers better and do more deals so i think our technology is better but at the end of the day its still good old fashioned service with improved technology i dont see anything substantially different between that mix of business or our ability to serve the customers obviously as we continue to expand our footprint a little bit in some different areas of our market we hopefully can pick up some additional customers but i wouldnt say dramatically different just an improved product and improved service model wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right thanks for the help david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thank you operator and our next question coming from the line of david long with raymond james your line is open edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone just as it relates to deposits youve had some very good deposit growth a lot of liquidity created is your sense that these deposits are stickier are these new relationships are they going to remain on your balance sheet for quite some time or do as things improve and customers start to spend again do you see a drop off in those deposits edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well judging by the activity in our treasury area these are all new relationships for the most part a lot of it is left over from the ppp loans we picked up close to new customers as we bring them in those are pretty sticky those are all full relationships so tim your thoughts timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah i mean david were watching it carefully but we feel pretty good i mean we continue to add households we dont disclose numbers here but we get the digital lift that everybody else is reporting on their calls and folks have good tools so weve added a couple of branches which will continue to bring a few more online between now and end of the year so again well watch it carefully but so far its pretty sticky david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it and then on the lending side the commercial side of your core ci stuff as far as the competitive backdrop we talked a little bit about that but internally are you guys doing anything differently are you able to loosen anything in your i dont know if standards is the right word but how have you changed internally your willingness to lend on the commercial side over the last few quarters edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well david i said this often we do not change our loan policy or our pricing decisions right away those are sacrosanct so were not seeing any more exceptions or deviations from our profitability models so to say we do wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 anything differently i would say no were not changing our credit stance at all we never do that murphy your thoughts richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah i know i would agree with that i mean its something we talk about on a regular basis in our credit meetings just where the markets at because the market is very competitive im sure you hear that through as you talk to other banks that the price competition is very hot structural competition is also pretty aggressive so were very mindful of that topic and we just have to know where the lines are and i think we have really good communication between the lines and our credit people to just to make sure that were all on the same page and i think weve done a pretty good job so far in that regard one maybe note to that is just as we continue to grow we look at different niches all the time and we want to be able to continue to broaden out our product suite so that would probably be the only sort of thing that we would maybe look to as we grow forward is just different areas weve talked about at leasing part of our leasing group to be in aviation finance and weve talked about the money services group and those are the things that we want to continue to evolve as the opportunities start to present themselves david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it and then just a final followup with the ppp and the additional relationships that you talked about maybe youre seeing on the deposit side are you seeing that in your low numbers today are your former ppp customers out of ppp and borrowing yet are you seeing any loan growth attributed to these new relationships yet timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp david its time we are i mean theres sort of two sides to that its obviously been a little bit of a substitution and part of the reason youre seeing the utilization down but weve also added new relationships and we track the larger ones and theres over billion in commitments that are already on the books with more to come and the utilization there is better than our utilization overall so we still feel good about that weve got more activity but were probably half the three quarters away through the ppp prospect pipeline richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah unfortunately it just takes longer to bring the lending side of the relationship over which is a lot of work that needs to get done in terms of getting that loan structure getting it approved and getting it documented working through the payoff but its definitely coming we see it on a weekly basis we see new opportunities that are coming as a result of our work with ppp edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp the market disruptions was very helpful still with mb theres still some hangover from that theres benefit to us with private same thing were starting to see more of that now as canada gets more involved down there and theyre changing some of the things that they do were seeing opportunities we never saw there and i would say first midwest move is you have to see what happens but any sort of market disruption is good for us when it wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 comes to a decision point we want to be there we want to have a seat at the table that people are going to change and weve been very successful at that david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks for the color guys appreciate it operator our next question coming from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc maybe dave a question for you on your mortgage outlook what type of production margins are you thinking about over the near term that top left graph on page shows a pretty steep decline down to last quarter david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah its impacted a little bit the way we presented by the decline in inventory and the pipeline and we also had a little bit of theres some volatility in the secondary marketing last quarter we had gains in this quarter we had some small losses but i think were thinking about it more in the sort of plus or minus range excluding any changes in the pipeline terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and then as a followup question im not sure ed maybe just not as creative as you typically are each quarter or maybe youre trying to tell us something but the last two press releases your final quote has been the exact same something along the lines of evaluate expenses on an ongoing basis to enhance profitability so should we read into that same statement two quarters in a row and is there some sort of expense plan coming or is it more of a big picture view that youre consciously are always aware of expenses edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp the latter were always looking at expenses and working them through at the same time were still are a growth company and were going to invest in the company we have a number of branches opening up in markets we havent been in yet oak park being one thats coming on board we should thats a great market for us weve never been there and do very well but it cost money to get them up and running contrary to maybe what some people believe we watch our expenses very closely with a net overhead ratio in the mid this quarter thats about where we think well normalize but i think it could be up or down wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 depending on some of the other things that we do but i think that mortgage is just kind of skews everything up for you guys and we wish we could find a better way to show you how it all works david explained it theres so many moving parts and the timing is so screwed up you record the income in one quarter while expense in the next quarter so it doesnt look right but all in all with the million that overhead ratio and our goal is to be in the mid right now in a normalized basis were comfortable but it doesnt mean we dont always look at expenses and try to run down terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp ill change it next time for you terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc i appreciate that thank you guys operator our next question is coming from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs your line is open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks david i just wanted to follow up on your mortgage commentary was there anything to call out regarding veterans first that volume dropped by a third or so it seemed to drop harder than the rest of the business david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i think their business is more heavily generally weighted towards the refinance activity and that part of the market got hit harder in our footprint where weve got customers just walking to the bank and have a relationship with the bank the purchase activity tends to be a heavier piece of it so i think its just more that the mix of purchase and refinance in the given marketplace brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and just combining securities growth and what you may retain from the mortgage bank i think youve given guidance around of production youre going to shunt on balance sheet how should we look at that versus how you may grow the investment securities book in this environment or it sounds like youre pretty cautious in growing that securities book given the rate environment if you could just kind of unpack that a little bit david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp weve been keeping the thought was to keep about million of the sort of jumbo mortgage production on our books but then we also generally have maybe million or so of other products that we originate in the bank some nonstandard or a variable rate products that we typically keep on the bulk side of the bank which is wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 normal but keep million of the production that we would normally sell so couple of million in total that we would add to the balance sheet per quarter i would say would be a good rough number and on the liquidity side youre right as we noted earlier were based essentially flat quarterend to quarterend because we just the mortgage backed rates sort of backed off a little bit and were just being cautious on investing that liquidity as ed and tim noted taking ph or sort of rates for a longterm instrument just doesnt seem that appealing right now and so were going to be patient with that and hope to grow the loan portfolio eat up some of that liquidity and we look at that as an opportunity it may suppress our earnings in the quarter a little bit by not investing at the longterm we look at that as an opportunity to grow the nii and grow the margin but were just trying to be patient and not invest at really low rates right now brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you operator operator instructions our next question coming from the line of nathan race with piper sandler your line is open nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co hi guys good morning edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co couple of questions on capital the stocks coming a little bit along with the rest of the group turnaround  to your tangible book these days just curious to get some updated thoughts on the assets around returning to buyback edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp weve got money left under our previous richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp authorization david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp authorization so if the time is right we will utilize that and go from there so yeah we look at it all the time vis àvis where to just where that return on capital where do we want to invest the money and at certain levels it makes sense to buy the stock back like yesterday would have been a good day but we were in a blackout period well see but wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp and we also like compare the acquisition opportunities out there too so just where youre going to invest your capital so we look at it constantly but i think we have about million plus or minus availability under the prior authorization and if market conditions are there we can look at what we do going forward but as ive said evaluate it all the time nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it and along those lines in terms of acquisitions ed or dave just curious i think in the past that youve spoken to an appetite to do a larger acquisition im not sure in terms of the asset range that you guys would be willing to go up to but just curious how that appetite stands today with the currency where its at obviously your capital levels are stable sequentially in a comfortable level id imagine so along those lines just curious can i get you updated thoughts on what youre seeing from an acquisition standpoint how large of a deal potentially youd want to do historically you guys have been strong stewards of defending and growing tangible book value and i imagine thatll continue to be the case going forward as you guys entertain potential acquisition opportunities so im just curious to get some updated thoughts on all those dynamics edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah we always take what the market gives us for years it gave us bills under billion of reasonable prices you know how much i dont like dilution so we still have anywhere from under billion to billion or billion are out there but were not going to do anything stupid we dont like giving up few years worth of earnings to grow when we can grow organically market is still viewed as good organic growth well stick with that unless a deal comes along to make strategic sense and what have you but i think that as to size the market is kind of limited now when you think of that when you think of geography so i said earlier i did a couple earnings calls ago threw out the concept that well be willing to look out of our traditional market area i was chumming in the water to see if i can get anybody out there it was a bad fishing day i guess but havent seen many but well look at anything basically that enhances shareholder value franchise value earnings and that we dont give away the house to get it but well always be very disciplined in that regard and well see where it goes but right now theyre across the board between billion billion down to million and the inbound calls have been very it picked up a lot however our price expectations for the first ones weve kind of reviewed dont fit that criteria i talked about earlier so if the local guys sell to somebody else thats good for us the disruption is good so especially they sell to somebody out of state or i think its harder and harder for banks now billion billion to stay competitive just the amount that you have to spend on technology with the additional regulatory things that are coming down the pike from new administration people and loans its getting good loans we all dig deeper were all in there trying to get those deals its just harder for those guys to compete i think its going to take some time for them to understand the magnitude of that what its going to do to their margins their costs and that when it does it will bring their price expectations back in line nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 got it and i suppose along those lines just given the organic growth trajectory in front of you guys thats likely going to accelerate with some of the recent disruption that was announced in chicago from an ma perspective i imagine acquisitions in that asset range that you described are probably less of a focus these days just given that organic growth runway thats in front of you guys today thats only gone stronger within the last couple of months here edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah but that doesnt mean that if a good deal came along we wouldnt do it richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah we can obviously do both but organic growth is really good analogy set but doesnt indiscernible out doing acquisition if market prices and strategically work edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah i mean weve been well be years old in december we have a good chance hitting billion just through organic growth its not bad from a card table to billion in years so people always ask how big do you want to be and i say well particularly i dont care where youll be five years from now i have no idea well take what the market gives us and what makes sense it makes sense well continue to grow and grow profitability and keep our shareholder give our returns up and we operate on asset growth profitability and growth in our tangible book value so if anything that fits those lines and advances those are reaching those goals is anything is available nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it not bad to say the least i appreciate all the color thanks guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp youre welcome thank you operator our next question coming from the line of indiscernible with truist securities your line is open michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey this is michael young on for truist securities thanks just wanted to ask as the loan growth broadens out maybe out of some of the premium finance categories would you expect those loan yields to be accretive to the overall loan yield with that mix shift or what are you seeing in the pricing environment that would cause that to happen or not richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 yeah i mean again as ed pointed out before we have a very strict pricing model that were just not going to go if something is not really accretive to where we want to be were just not going to do it i mean so i think overall yeah we monitor that very closely and confident that we can do that michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay and maybe just a followup on the expense commentary related to mortgage obviously you guys are seeing quite strong loan production so i would assume theres some natural inflation to the expense run rate but with the offset of that million potential reduction depending on production levels is that kind of the right way to think about it those two pieces richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp im not sure if i follow this youre just saying that in the past you think the expenses are inflated a little bit because of the extraordinarily high volume is that what youre trying to get to michael young q analyst truist securities inc i guess is it more of a net million reduction that you kind of expect in expenses quarteroverquarter assuming the production levels you discussed or are there some core expense inflation factors from strong loan production that would offset that richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp no what i was trying to get at is i think netnet million i mean assuming that the revenue levels in line with the prior quarter now lets say production revenues got this million lets say theyre million and they go up million i would expect the expenses to go up a little bit too so but you should be able to maintain that delta of roughly million profit improvement on the business michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay perfect thanks operator and our next question coming from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc asset quality you guys have historically been quick to move any problems and it serves you all over cycles given the amount of i guess thirst for assets across the industry are there any portfolio that you guys are effectively looking to reduce exposure to given a bid for assets is high today thanks richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp chris weve done asset sales in the past and were always calling through the portfolio to try to find where weak spots exist and just to go to see the market out there and so i would say were open to that concept weve done pretty well were open to that concept weve done pretty well getting through a maximum value on the asset that wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 we do work through so when you in the past when weve looked at some of those prices we just werent willing to accept the discount but if that gap starts to narrow even more going forward we might take a look at some of the portfolios where maybe we see some distress but generally speaking i mean were just kind of take a deal at a time and work it through so no plans as of this point christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks rich operator im showing no further questions at this time i would not like to attend a conference call back over to mr edward wehmer for closing remarks edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks everybody for listening in our goal is to continue to increase all the important things in the right way and not have decreases so with that thanks very much well talk to you again in a month or three months and any further questions or
