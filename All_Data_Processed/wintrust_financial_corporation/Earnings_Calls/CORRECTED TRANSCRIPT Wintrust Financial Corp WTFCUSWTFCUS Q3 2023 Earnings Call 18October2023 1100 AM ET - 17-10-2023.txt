mr tim crane wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 timothy s crane president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp good morning everybody welcome to wintrust wednesday this is the day of the week we require all of our wintrust staff to be on site were glad that you have joined us too for our third quarter earnings call with me this morning are dave dykstra our chief operating officer rich murphy our chief lending officer dave stoehr our chief financial officer and kate boege our general counsel in terms of an agenda i will share some high level highlights dave dykstra will speak to the financial results and rich will add some additional information and color on credit performance ill wrap up with just a few summary thoughts and as always well do our best to answer some questions earnings or net income for the quarter were just over million up from both the second quarter and the third quarter last year from our standpoint a very solid result with good loan and deposit growth and continued good credit performance as rich will highlight we are not seeing any systemic credit issues at this point our margin at was within the range we expected down essentially just for the impact of our hedging activities we continue to benefit from a loan portfolio that prices relatively quickly youll recall that nearly of our loans mature or reprice within a year the resulting improvement in loan yield allows us to largely offset the increase in deposit costs which i would add we believe are moderating at this point our growth and the relatively stable margin resulted in net interest income growth for the quarter and on a year overyear basis from a margin from a market standpoint we continue to see isolated disruption among competitors and as a result we continue to add clients and create longterm franchise value we expect that in the coming quarters we will continue to grow loans and deposits our liquidity position remained strong the deposit growth not only allowed us to fund good loan growth but also to reduce the level of brokered deposits during the quarter again overall a solid quarter which we believe will compare well and in fact may differentiate us relative to many of our competitors with that ill turn this over to dave to provide some additional financial details david a dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp great thanks tim first with respect to the balance sheet growth were again pleased to see deposits for the quarter grow by approximately billion or on an annualized basis this deposit growth was primarily in the form of interest bearing retail deposits and that growth allowed us to reduce our level of brokered deposits by million as to deposit composition noninterest bearing deposits at the end of the quarter represented of total deposits compared to at the end of the second quarter the slight reduction in the percentage of non interest bearing deposits to total deposits is really more a reflection of deposit growth occurring in the interest bearing categories rather than any large losses of noninterest bearing deposit accounts weve seen the noninterest bearing balances stabilize as evidenced by the billion of average noninterest bearing deposit balances in the third quarter being roughly equal to the billion balance at the end of the second quarter this strong deposit growth helped to fund solid loan growth of million for the third quarter wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 adjusting for the impact of the sale of certain commercial insurance premium finance loans during the third quarter total loans increased million or on an annualized basis which is consistent with our prior guidance of mid to highsingledigit loan growth the increase in loans was primarily the result of draws on existing commercial real estate loan facilities as well as growth in the commercial portfolio additionally despite the loan sale transaction that reduced outstanding balances by million at the end of the third quarter the commercial insurance premium portfolio ended relatively unchanged which is a good result rich murphy will discuss the loan portfolio growth in more detail in just a bit the result of these and other balance sheet movements was growth in total assets of approximately billion a slightly reduced ending loantodeposit ratio of and riskbased capital ratios that were relatively stable to up a little overall it was a very successful quarter in the growth of our franchise our differentiated business model exceptional service and the unique positioning that we have in the chicago and milwaukee markets continues to serve us well turning to the income statement categories starting with the net interest income for the third quarter of net interest income totaled million an increase of approximately million as compared to the prior quarter and an increase of million as compared to the third quarter of i should note that the third quarter net interest income represents the highest quarterly amount ever recorded by the company the increase in net interest income as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to the increase in average earning assets of approximately billion the net interest margin was in the third quarter which was just basis points less than the prior quarter level of basis points of the basis points of the decline was due to the impact of our interest rate hedging strategies which are designed to protect our net interest income if interest rates decline accordingly as we discussed on prior calls our balance sheet composition structure and repricing characteristics provided for a relatively stable net interest margin during the quarter deposit pricing moderated in the third quarter of and we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter based on the current interest rate environment we believe we can maintain our net interest margin within a narrow range around the current levels for the remainder of id also like to note that total loans as of september were million higher than the average total loans in the third quarter of this provides momentum into the fourth quarter this growth and the expected growth in the balance sheet and the relatively stable net interest margin should allow for future growth of our net interest income in the fourth quarter turning to provision for credit losses wintrust recorded a provision for credit losses of million in the third quarter compared to a provision of million in the prior quarter and million provision expense recorded in the yearago quarter the lower provision expense in the third quarter relative to the second quarter was primarily a result of lower net loan growth during the third quarter rich murphy will talk about the credit loan characteristics in just a bit regarding noninterest income and noninterest expense sections total noninterest income totaled million in the third quarter and was relatively stable when compared to the priorquarter total of million as shown in the table in our earnings release there are a number of relatively small changes to a variety of non interest income categories but in the aggregate the changes netted to a slight decrease of from the prior quarter this illustrates the importance of having diversified fee businesses that can contribute at various levels over time and the ability of those business lines to maintain a relatively stable level of noninterest income despite what is a challenging mortgage environment wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 on the noninterest expense categories noninterest expenses totaled million in the third quarter of and were up approximately million when compared to the priorquarter total of million now there are a few primary reasons for the increases which are related to the negative impacts of one occupancy costs of approximately million from the impairment of two companyowned buildings that are no longer being used two data processing costs of approximately million from the termination of a duplicate service contract related to the acquisition of the wealth management business in other salary costs of approximately million related to acquisition acquisitionrelated severance charges and other contractually due compensation costs and then we also had an increase in our commissions and incentive compensation of million primarily because of the adjustments to our incentive compensation accruals due to the strong earning levels the remainder of the variances in the noninterest expense categories both positive and negative generally offset to relatively small remaining change so despite the growth in the noninterest expenses and the uncommon nature of some of the items that i just noted the companys annualized ratio of noninterest expenses as a percent of average quarterly assets actually declined by basis points to in the third quarter additionally our efficiency ratio remained stable at in both the second and the third quarters of and similarly the companys net overhead ratio was relatively stable at in the third quarter and increased just basis point from the recorded in the prior quarter so in summary this was a very solid quarter with strong loan and deposit growth improved liquidity position stabilized net interest margin with a steady outlook a record level of net revenues continued low levels of nonperforming assets and the second highest quarterly net income result in the companys history we feel like weve managed well through a somewhat turbulent period thus far in delivering net income that was a record for the first ninemonth period of any fiscal year in the history of the company and we have a positive outlook for continued growth in assets revenues and earnings so with that i will conclude my comments and turn it over to rich murphy to discuss credit richard b murphy vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp thanks dave as noted earlier credit performance continued to be very solid in the third quarter from a number of perspectives as dave noted and as detailed on slide of the deck loan growth for the quarter was million if you adjust for the sale of the premium finance loans in july total loans increased by million or on an annualized basis this growth is due to a number of factors commercial premium finance volumes remained strong as we continue to see a significantly harder market for insurance premiums particularly for commercial properties resulting in higher average loan sizes we also continue to see new opportunities as a result of consolidations within the premium finance industry finally we saw a good growth in commercial real estate largely from draws on existing construction loans and our leasing group had another solid quarter this rate of loan growth when adjusted for the sale of loans in the quarter is in line with our guidance of mid to highsingle digits we also believe that loan growth for the fourth quarter will continue to be within our guidance for the following reasons commercial premium finance should continue to show solid growth our core ci pipelines look very good and our leasing teams continue to see significant demand in the market and as we have noted on prior calls we continue to benefit from disruptions in the banking landscape and have seen numerous quality opportunities in our core businesses in addition we are looking at a number of lending teams and niche lending opportunities that come from dislocations at other regional banks wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 offsetting this growth will be continued pressure on line utilization which is down to as higher borrowing costs and negative have negatively affected usage for the past several quarters and we anticipate that higher borrowing costs will continue to cause borrowers to reconsider the economics of new projects business expansion and equipment purchases in summary we continue to be optimistic about loan growth for the balance of and we believe our diversified portfolio and position within the competitive landscape will allow us to grow within our guidance of mid to highsingle digits and maintain our credit discipline from a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide we continue to see strong credit performance across the portfolio this can be seen in a number of metrics nonperforming loans increased by million in the quarter from basis points to basis points however million of this increase is in the premium finance portfolio these loans are secured by the unearned premiums and we would anticipate no additional losses overall npls continue to be at historically low levels and we are confident about solid credit performance of the portfolio going forward chargeoffs for the quarter were million or basis points down from million in the second quarter and finally as detailed on slide we saw stable levels in our special mention and substandard loans with no meaningful signs of additional economic stress at the customer level as noted in our last few earnings calls we continue to be highly focused on our exposure to commercial real estate loans which composed roughly onequarter of our total portfolio higher borrowing costs and pressure on occupancy and lease rates are cause for concern particularly in the office category on slide weve updated a number of the important characteristics in our office portfolio currently this portfolio remains steady at billion or of our total cre exposure and only of our total loan portfolio of the billion of office exposure is medical office or owner occupied the average size of a loan in the office portfolio continues to be around million and we have only five loans above million we continue to closely monitor loans secured by office properties located within central business districts our cbd exposure is limited to million or approximately onequarter of the office portfolio half of this is in chicago and half of this is in other cities the bulk of our portfolio is located in suburban areas and areas outside the central business districts and npls in this category were flat quarteroverquarter and continue to be at very nominal levels we continue to perform portfolio reviews regularly on this portfolio and we stay very engaged with our borrowers as we have noted previously we are not immune from the macro effects that challenge this product type but we believe our portfolio is wellconstructed very granular and should perform well moving forward to better understand the stresses in our portfolio our cre team updated their deep dive analysis on every loan over million which will be renewing between now and the second quarter of this analysis which covered of all cre loans maturing during this period resulted in the following roughly onehalf of these loans will clearly qualify for a renewal at prevailing rates roughly of these loans are anticipated to be paid off or will require a shortterm extension at prevailing rates the remaining of these loans will require some additional attention which could include a paydown or a pledge of additional collateral we have backchecked the results of these deep dives conducted during prior quarters and have found that the projected outcomes versus actual outcomes were very tightly correlated and generally speaking borrowers whose loans deemed to require additional attention continue to support their loans by providing enhancements including principal reductions wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 again our portfolio is not immune from the rising effects from the effects of rising rates or the market forces behind lease rates but we have been diligently identifying weaknesses in the portfolio and working with our borrowers to identify the best possible outcomes and we believe that our portfolio is in reasonably good shape and situated to weather the challenges ahead that concludes my comments on credit and ill turn it back to tim timothy s crane president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp thanks rich just to wrap up our prepared remarks we continue to believe that were very wellpositioned perhaps uniquely positioned to take advantage of the current environment with our diverse businesses although the last several quarters weve taken steps to achieve an interest rate sensitivity position much closer to neutral we will benefit from rates that may be higher for longer and based on current economic conditions and current banking conditions we expect a margin that will be reasonably set reasonably stable in a narrow range around the current level for the coming quarters rich noted some evidence of slowing economic activity i can tell you we remain very active but disciplined in what i would call a choppy market but as also noted there are clearly opportunities and we will continue to pursue them aggressively in the coming months at this point ill pause and lateef if you open it up we can take some questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah good morning guys tim a question for you a topic you just discussed on the kind of the nearterm versus mediumterm margin outlook are you saying that beyond the fourth quarter based on the asset pricing cadence that you see that the margin can start to march higher in is that stable in the fourth quarter potentially moving higher in is that the message timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp yes i mean i think theres obviously a number of moving pieces to this jon at the moment looking out a quarter or two we think pretty stable after that i think theres signs that we would feel optimistic about but clearly theres a lot that goes into it past the next quarter or two wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay how about hedging appetite is the plan to continue to hedge more do you feel like youve done what you need to do timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp well one for those of you that are kind of following there is a description of our hedges in the appendix that we share with everybody that shows about billion of hedges one added in the first or in the third quarter weve subsequently added another small hedge and i think we would continue to kind of follow the market up jon if we have the opportunity to do that as weve talked about our desire is to certainly narrow the downside exposure on our margin and we performed well with a margin in the mid we work hard to stay in that range jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you for that and then rich a question for you on the premium finance nonperformers can you i think i understand it but can you explain it and why is it up and when does this stuff get resolved naturally richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah well two different buckets of loans there jon so and roughly equal to each other if you look at page there is slide you can kind of see what the effects are so ill take each one individually in the pc side we are seeing a little bit more stress in the transportation area so those loans are falling more delinquent more often we do the analysis on those and if there is a loss we will take the loss and then well get the unearned premium back from the carrier so its a in that situation there is some economic deterioration that is causing more of those numbers to go days past due now thats again the loss given default is unchanged there but you are seeing incidence of default go up there in that category the life category is a little bit different and its a similar amount about million and those really result from as rates have come up and people get to the maturity of their loan and they are looking at renewing that policy they have to make a decision whether it still makes economic sense for them and those conversations can get elongated and we are we want to work with our clients and give them time to make that decision in an orderly fashion so we are not necessarily automatically sending and canceling the policy and going back to the carrier we want to make sure that we work with the client so those might extend beyond days past due but generally speaking theyre always going to be fully insured and we wouldnt anticipate that there would be any problems there those loans that are days past due that we have identified here we would anticipate that those will be gone by the end of this month jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay and on the commercial npls if this is a persistent issue youre saying that youre thinking that could remain elevated but this is kind of the ninemonth loan on a 12month insurance contract is that thats the structure is that right wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah that thats right but the and we do think that loans within our pc portfolio that apply to transportation will have a little bit more pressure and you still may see ongoing defaults couple important points there is that we are getting a pretty good sized premium on those and we get reasonable late charges so we are getting paid for that risk so were not all that concerned about it from that perspective but we also are taking some measures here to make sure that we are our underwriting is maybe addressing some of those things so we are getting a little bit tighter in that space but generally speaking again while this is an elevated level were not concerned about future losses out of it jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you very much operator thank you standby for our next question our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty of kbw timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp hi chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning dave i want to go at the nii again the a lot of your peers are still defending the trough or trying to find the trough six months out you gave the guide for continued growth in nii in  kind of a stableish margin higher for longer you got that unique back book but it would feel like nii continues to grow throughout maybe the pace is not as significant but is that a fair estimate based on what you see of the world david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well yeah i think thats how we look at it chris obviously we the fed kills the economy and loan growth slows quite a bit that would have an impact but the benefit of being diversified in our asset classes is as rich has said many times in the past is if one area slows down another area is doing okay so we do think we can keep growing our loans in that mid to highsingle digit range and as tim just talked about on the prior question we think stable and potentially optimistic in the latter half of the year as far as the margin goes but again it depends on where the interest rate curve is and all that kind of stuff and how competitive deposit cost is if that picks up right now we said we see it moderating so its very positive so i guess a longwinded answer to say yeah we still think we can grow mid to highsingle digits and we think the margin is stable so if thats the case we think we can have growth christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great just on the loan sales can you just remind us you talked about it last quarter kind of testing the plumbing should we expect more of that to occur and was there a i assume theres a gain that showed up in the noninterest income just trying to get the logistics wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well were not planning on any right now as you said i mean we if you go back into the second quarter when we started to plan this and we did the sale early in the third quarter as we talked about on the last call we really did it as a way to demonstrate that that portfolio has liquidity and it pays down very rapidly we would expect the majority of that impact to be gone by the end of this fiscal year since these are ninemonth full pay out loans and well be six months into it so therell be very little really left of that impact but we wanted to be able to demonstrate that we had liquidity we wanted to be able to make sure we had a tool in case concentrations of the premium finance portfolios got too high we wanted to be able to have the plumbing in place in case there was any future liquidity events that happened in the industry so we just thought it was prudent to do the sale put the plumbing in place test it out and move forward but right now based upon the good deposit growth that were having and our ability to continue to fund those loans and our loantodeposit ratio being in a spot that we like it we dont have any expectations that well do another sale on the near term but the facility is there in the event we need it for some reason christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect and then maybe the last one you went through all the moving parts of noninterest income and i think it amounted to million how do we think about just the trajectory of your fees with mortgage obviously pretty depressed but youve got other offsets from here david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well mortgage and wealth management are two big areas service charges sort of just plug along and maybe grow with the growth of your business and retail accounts but mortgages the pipelines are pretty consistent and theyre in the purchase business maybe that slows down a little bit in the winter months since the majority of our originations come out of the chicago milwaukee and minnesota markets but applications i think are about as low as they go so we would expect steady originations gain on sale margins have been holding in a little above and so we think that well just plug along and then there might be some fluctuation depending upon movements in rates and the impact on mortgage servicing rights but we try to hedge that impact pretty well too so i think our personal opinion is i think mortgage probably bounces along here for the next couple of quarters hopefully in the spring buying season we see some green shoots and some improvement in the applications and the production but i dont see anything i dont see anything that would indicate that it would increase rapidly in the near term or decrease rapidly its been plugging along at these levels for four or five six months now so we expect that to continue wealth management somewhat depends upon on the movement of the underlying assets under management and their valuations because some of the fees are based upon a lot of the values but we continue to try to hire people and grow that business but its a little bit slower trajectory forward but we would expect it to grow so weve got some leasing income in there etcetera but the rest is pretty small christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks dave wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy of stephens inc terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi thanks good morning everyone maybe start with a question the expense outlook for the fourth quarter there were a couple items called out on the expense line right in the opening of the press release but you shared some thoughts on and maybe while im on any initial thoughts on expenses whether that will track kind of historical growth rates or we are hearing from some other banks that theyre looking at expenses with some internal plans to kind of control that growth rate david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well youre right terry we call out about million of sort of uncommon expenses that we wouldnt expect to recur in the fourth quarter so thats if you take those out youre in 324ish or something like that so probably somewhere plus or minus in that area for the fourth quarter we havent really given guidance for yet but generally speaking our thought is that were a growth company and we have lots of opportunities were uniquely positioned here in chicago right now with our size and how we stack up against the competition basically were going against big banks and small community banks there just arent a lot of banks between billion and billion that are headquartered in the chicago area so we have a unique position here that we think we can take advantage of and we also have our niche businesses that can help out so weve always thought of ourselves as a growth company we still think we can grow deposits are out there and having good growth and so wed rather grow into this and if we grow mid to highsingle digits we would expect that our noninterest expenses would grow at a rate less than that maybe midsingle digits and so we can leverage the infrastructure going forward if for some reason the growth doesnt come there are certainly levers we can pull to try to reduce expenses but the plan is to grow into it and leverage the infrastructure and as i said actually our noninterest expenses even with that million in there as a percent of average assets was down a little bit this quarter so were going to watch and were going to control them but were still expecting to be growing the franchise and taking advantage of opportunities in the marketplace and thats always been the plan and continues to be the plan terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then maybe as a followup the million of cre growth in the third quarter can you help us understand how much of that came from kind of market opportunities new customers versus current customers and how successful have you been in bringing or having them bring over their deposit relationships and business as well richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah ill answer that sort of in reverse order pretty much any new opportunity that were looking at its assumed that were going to be getting meaningful deposits thats number one as it relates to the growth as i said in my comments the majority of what were seeing there are draws on existing facilities that we have with existing customers but theres probably about of that total comes from opportunities that were seeing in the marketplace as you know a lot of other banks are really out of that space right now and there are good wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 opportunities out there for us to bring over clients so its a little bit of a mix but the majority is still with existing clients and existing outstandings terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks for taking my questions timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp thanks terry operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david long of raymond james timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp hi david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone thanks for the update on loan growth expectations it sounds like the pipeline is still pretty good my question when im looking at the surveys of lenders theres not a does not seem to be a big appetite to lend nor much of a demand for loans as there has been whats making wintrust different here how are you guys able to grow the portfolio when the market may be expecting more of a flattish outlook for loan growth richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp as weve talked about in the past loan growth comes in many different forms for us so we go back to a point when we were just out of the pandemic or in the middle of the pandemic and rates were very low life finance was just going crazy now thats slowed down but in the meantime we have the pc side kind of filling in that gap so having a multipronged approach to lending really does make a difference for us in terms of when you have growth in certain areas but more specifically as it relates to maybe the core businesses i would say that weve been pretty disciplined about the way our portfolio is constructed a lot of banks right now would look at their cre bucket and say its probably more than ideal we would say that right now we still have an appetite for cre loans and so were able to take advantage of that dislocation in the market similarly that with a lot of the david as you know in chicago weve had tremendous amount of disruption with the players in chicago and were seeing lots of opportunities on the ci side for companies that weve been actively trying to bring over for some time and they just for whatever reason stuck with the incumbent until they just couldnt take it any longer and so as a result weve been able to bring over a lot of those so we continue to be pretty bullish about growing that portfolio particularly on the core side we really see a lot of nice opportunities right now wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp and david weve been disciplined on pricing but theres loan demand is there you just have to pick your spots and were getting a lot of looks richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah thats a great point tim i mean where structures had been if you go back months ago or months ago structures were pretty loose pricing was pretty tight and those were times where we were there were deals that we just stepped away from right now you can get better structure you can get better pricing and we try to be very disciplined in that space indiscernible david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks for that color timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp yeah go ahead yeah well ill just say we can continue to grow deposits weve proven for a couple of quarters that we can fund the loan growth and our desire would be to continue to grow the deposit base its kind of the core of our franchise and weve talked several times about the fact that were market share in deposits in the chicago area opportunities in milwaukee as well so even though the deposit share results were pretty good for us we think thats just the beginning richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah i would say sort of the macro summary on your question is that there is no shortage of opportunities to lend money out there right now and i think theres a lot of banks that are just maybe unwilling for the deposit and capital reasons so our job is to take advantage of this moment david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc so it sounds like the strategy is still focused on organic growth because thats what the market is giving you what is the appetite for ma at this point and what does the backdrop or what needs to change in the backdrop maybe for you guys to be more opportunistic on that front to accelerate growth timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp well there are acquisition type opportunities so whether thats a portfolio of loans or whether its a piece of a business or in some cases the conversations around kind of bank ma are picking up but were pretty disciplined and some of these portfolios are challenged from pricing perspective and we dont need to do that kind of growth given the opportunities that we have if some of those look like good opportunities to us we may add some people for example in areas where weve got good businesses there are some folks available in the market right now but i think well stay pretty disciplined wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks guys appreciate the color there timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp yeah thanks david operator thank you our next question comes from the line of casey haire of jefferies timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp hi casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning guys i guess just sorry if i missed this i wanted to follow up a little bit more on the nim discussion but did you guys disclose what spot loan yields were and deposit costs at richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp no we havent done that but what we can tell you is that the margin was right near the current level at the end of the period and were really focused on the net margin going forward but the deposit pricing has moderated as you can see and we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter but no we didnt we didnt provide that casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and then just i guess switching to credit the acl on the core book at obviously very strong just curious what kind of scenario are you guys baking in be it slow down ph s3 or any color on what kind of unemployment rate that which is driving your cecl modeling richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah well i mean we use a number we look at it at a number of different ways i mean we use as a base we use moodys base case scenario but we do also look at other economic scenarios to build our case we dont have a big consumer portfolio so unemployment is generally not a big impact in our models with correlation we use a consumer real estate price index the baa credit spreads and a few other factors those certainly have a major impact quarteroverquarter change the real reason the provision was less this quarter was we just had less loan growth this quarter while the other factors sort of washed out but roughly million of that reduction was just due to less loan growth in the third quarter relative to the second quarter but to answer your question generally is we used the moodys model and we supplement that with a couple of other economic sources casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff rulis of da davidson jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning just a couple of housekeeping items on the just wanted to followup the cowork office credits you pushed out last quarter is that largely done is there anything else youre trying to kind of manage out within the office side david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp as we disclosed last quarter that that sale took up roughly half of that portfolio we will continue to explore options related to the rest of that exposure and my guess is well hopefully get something done here relatively soon but it just depends on what that market looks like we are always looking at assets within the portfolio and determining kind of the best course of action but nothing pending right now jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay and then on the back to the premium finance sales kind of the testing the plumbing i imagine some of that is just kind of mix management but was there a credit portion of that i mean now that it sounds as if youre going to slow some of those sales despite a little pickup near term in nonperformers or nonaccruals anything else on the premium finance that you might thats got a credit tinged to it that you want to kind of like you said youre always looking at exiting riskier portfolios is there some concern in that book i suppose david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no we didnt that sale really wasnt at all for credit it was all a liquidity play and testing that for liquidity reasons as rich said we really think those portfolios are low cost portfolios so we dont worry about them from that perspective and even on the life side like rich talked about i mean youll notice that that million that was nonperforming is still accruing we generally will allow some of these to go past due but if for some reason we are no longer collateralized then well unwind the policy so we just dont feel like and you can see our historical loss rates of zero basis points over the history of that portfolio would indicate that thats how we managed that portfolio on the pc side were not worried about the economics over the credit side of the equation so the sale had nothing to do with credit it had everything to do with liquidity jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay appreciate the clarification yeah it sounds pretty short duration stuff anyway david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 i guess one last one on the just back to the margin sorry to kind of beat up on this but it sounds like pretty back end loaded loan growth in the quarter talking about deposit pricing moderating i guess is the in the short term that kind of margin stability is that conservatism kind of the expectation of maybe more hedging headwinds or just being again conservative overall because it sounds fairly positive given those factors as you lead into the fourth quarter timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp yeah i would think i would say its fairly balanced i mean we still have cd book that reprices upward i mean there will be movement in deposit costs we just also believe that theres continued asset repricing particularly in the two premium finance portfolios which will continue to offset that so i think its a pretty balanced look were working hard to move the margin up as much as we can but its pretty balanced at this point david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp i mean the hedging cost costs us basis points in the quarter but its good risk management for a downrate scenario but im not sure id use the word conservatism we try to be realistic in that and we just think we have a balanced book right now so we think the margin will stay relatively stable you could have a lot more deposit growth than you thought and maybe that puts some pressure on the margin but thats okay because you bring in good deposits that adds to the franchise and allows you to fund good loan growth so the timing may go id say it goes up a couple of basis points or down a couple of basis points but we think itll be in a relatively tight band going forward just because of the structure and the repricing nature of both the sides of the balance sheet so jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yeah and maybe just the last one just the ideal environment that you heard for the rate environment if you think about margin a little further out i mean maybe thats the point of the hedge is to keep it somewhat stable but i guess had we spoke to it specifically if the fed does nothing if we hike or we get cuts over time i guess timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp well jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co what would be the if we look at the balance of the way youre positioned what from a fed standpoint is ideal timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp well as we talked about were much more neutral than we had been and you can see that on i think its table table sorry we still are asset sensitive we benefit a little bit if rates continue to stay high or move up who knows we may get something in december or january here if the political kind of issues quiet down but wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 were pretty square at this point and so were going to grow net interest income primarily through growth at this point and thats what were focused on doing jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yeah appreciate it thanks timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp yeah operator thank you timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp i guess the other thing i would add is obviously not only is the hedging program helpful but if rates turn down the mortgage business will pick up relatively quickly we think theres just a lot of refinance opportunity even with a moderate move there so again we like the diversity of our businesses as an element in helping to kind of stabilize the performance going forward operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brody preston of ubs brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone how are you timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp good morning brody were good brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey i just want to ask a couple of quick questions on the composition of loan portfolio do you happen to have what the percent of the portfolio is that are shared national credits and of that what you happen to be the lead on david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah so total sncs in our portfolio are just over billion were the lead on about of that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp i would also kind of point out that of our snc portfolio much of that is really tied to the businesses that were in franchise finance has a significant number of sncs where other banks are buying into our credits were buying into their credits similarly like in the insurance space similar things so were generally not a player and just buying into other peoples deals it really is our approach to this is just to facilitate the growth of individual business lines and making sure that we see how other banks are managing those credits and so we believe its a sound approach but it also gives us some intel into how other competitors are working in that market brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and on the office portfolio do you happen to have what the reserve level and the average loan to value is david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp we dont disclose loantovalue we think thats a little bit of a misleading number because whether its a loanto value based on time of origination or if people are getting loans reappraised we think its a little bit of a misrepresentative number i would say that our general loan policy were typically going to be sub70 and at time of origination richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp and on the reserve side its really sort of included in our overall commercial real estate we dont disclose a separate one for office so it would be sort of included in the commercial real estate sector we do have some qualitative factors that we apply but we havent disclosed the specifics for that line item brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay got it and i know you talked a little bit about the analysis that you guys continue to do about the office loans that are coming due over the next months do you happen to have the number i guess the actual dollar amount of loans that are coming due over the next months and how does that look as we go forward through richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah i dont i would say that you hear about the wall of maturities i mean as we looked at it and kind of just looked out through all of next year we really dont see it i mean its really kind of spread out pretty evenly through and but i dont have the number that was in that population david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp and we dont have that handy richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah i dont have it handy i do have wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp we indiscernible we just dont have it handy here brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah yeah understood and so you just one last one on the office book you said you dont disclose the ltv but do you happen to disclose do you happen to have what the debt service coverage ratio looks like david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp again we dont disclose that but generally we want to on a stressed basis were looking for a coverage on deals that we do brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay got it dave just i wanted to follow up on the sale of the premium finance loans did you i think we had talked about million before and it looks like it came in at like million what was the rationale behind selling less than the million david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well the million was the outstanding balance at the end of the quarter so that would have been the impact we sold close to million in early july but because these loans pay down so quickly and on a monthly basis that million had amortized down to million by the end of the quarter so that was the end of the quarter impact brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thanks for the clarification and to follow up on chriss question did you guys happen to book a gain on that through fee income at all and if you did do you know what the dollar amount is david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah the gain was roughly million for the quarter brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and that would be in other income then david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yes sir wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then the last one was just on the just on the nim trajectory i know theres been a lot of discussion on it i just wanted to ask how are you thinking about i think youre calling for stability maybe as we go forward into which feels kind of right but i guess how are you thinking about rate cuts at all how will that impact the margin just given the swaps that you put in and then specifically on the swaps the new ones that you put on what would be the basis point kind of impact on the nim in terms of drag from the new swaps timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp well the drag right now is basis points for the quarter and you can see in our disclosure the individual swaps primarily received fixed that go out in some cases three years in some cases five years with actually a forward start term but if we start to get rates falling we think well get better loan activity as the economy picks up we think the mortgage business will pick up obviously thats not a margin related item but we think that the offsetting factors to potential nim compression come in other areas of the business and so thats how we look at it and thats when we talk about this being in a narrow band as we get into some of these other factors it gets a little bit harder to project exactly david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah and i mean before when rates went to zero our margin was in the mid i mean to and we just never wanted to get back there we think with these hedges we have in place now if rates went to zero again we would stay above i mean thered be some compression and wed have offsets that tim talked about but we wouldnt go back into that mid2 range based on this hedging position that we have in place brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you very much operator thank you i would now like to turn the conference back to tim crane for closing remarks sir timothy s crane president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp yeah guys thank you very much for your time this morning i hope we did a reasonable job answering your questions this is a lot about blocking and tackling for us we think were uniquely positioned to take advantage of opportunities that were seeing in the market and as always well work very hard to deliver good results so thank you very much
