call with me again are dave dykstra dave stoehr kate boege our general counsel tim crane and rich murphy same form as usual im going to give some general comments regarding our results turn over to tim crane for more detail on the balance sheet in the second quarter dave dykstra will provide detail on other income other expense and rich wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 murphy will discuss credit by the way we need to refer to murph as captain murphy because he is going to be crewing wintrusts first entry into the world famous mackinac race something weve been sponsoring chicago mackinac so hes going to sail us out on here and go get them gilligan and back to me for some comments on the future and we have some time for questions all in all it was a great quarter for us but one we consider a transitional quarter for wtfc transitional in the sense we will be relying less on mortgage income going forward and more on the margin income for net income increases in the coming quarters this has always been our design by the way we like to stay very positive to gaap so that we can in a higher rate environment we are able to increase the margin to cover more than cover expenses that will result from the inflationary period and thats what were doing right now overall the quarter is characterized by terrific loan growth across the board billion period end loans exceeded the average for the second quarter by billion it bodes well for the future quarters overall interest rate sensitivity position allows the margin to increase to up basis points from quarter one it should be noted that junes margin was close to the before we expect the margin could increase as previous rate increases work their way the balance sheet this should future increase rate increases occur net interest income increased million quarteroverquarter earnings estimates were up basis points cost of funds is up basis points and free fund contribution increased basis points of course negatively affected by security losses of about million pardon me million loss on some excess real estate our old data center and the property thats been held for expansion use for storage we decided to get rid of them and be done with them and the increase well also by the increased provision to cover our loan growth by about million to million the former of these two items negatively affected our overhead ratio so about you disregard those amounts wed be closer to indiscernible is somewhat muted by our work by our hedging process our hedging strategies are a work in process dave is going to talk about that a little bit later credit metrics which well discuss remain really remain extremely healthy and terrific wealth management revenue held up nicely despite the markets of mortgages and our own and mortgages held their own considering the rate environment dave will cover both of these indiscernible the capital offering netted million it was a great success for our standalone businesses for additional growth so in the earnings front as you know we made million a share pretax preprovision of million really a good number considering where weve been and where were going and i think theres a small chart in the package you could read asset on the balance sheet side were up nicely i should say indiscernible capital offering helped in that and with that im going to turn over to mr crane whos going to discuss the balance sheet timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp great thank you ed id like to highlight a few balance sheet items as well as expand on a couple of the numbers that you mentioned youll note that this will be the last quarter we reference ppp loans as in most cases the balances and related financial impact are reaching levels that are relatively insignificant to our results on a quarteroverquarter basis obviously the yearoveryear impacts were documented in the financials the billion of loan growth excluding ppp that ed referenced represents loan growth on an annualized basis and importantly was spread across all categories and also as ed mentioned the end of period loans were wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 substantially higher than the quarter average which will help us going into the third quarter going forward while encouraged by stable pipelines we believe that loan growth in the mid to highsingle digits on an annualized basis may represent a more reasonable expectation given the current uncertainty around the macroeconomic outlook deposit growth for the quarter was about million influenced by both seasonal tax related outflows and the very disciplined approach to pricing in the rising rate environment interest bearing deposit costs of basis points for the quarter were up basis points from the end of the first quarter and will begin to trend up with the rising rates while the competitor deposit pricing remains very muted we are starting to see increases in the more rate sensitive of the deposit categories as an example municipal deposits often track some of the state indices in addition we believe a large fed increase at the meeting next week would also accelerate deposit pricing discussions in the market for the quarter our securities book remained essentially unchanged we used excess liquidity to fund the strong loan growth essentially replacing maturing securities obviously at a rate thats trending up and at quarter end liquidity remains strong with about billion of interestbearing cash on the balance sheet as discussed last quarter our securities book of billion is about available for sale held to maturity during the quarter the continued rise in rates resulted in an additional tax adjusted unrealized loss of million on the afs securities despite this reduction tangible book value for the quarter increased to a record level as rising rates and rate sensitivity remain a topic of interest i want to reiterate some of what was discussed on last quarters call first although our gaap position is down slightly we remain asset sensitive and well positioned to benefit from continued rising interest rates as a reminder and this is outlined in our presentation materials approximately of our loans reprice or mature within a year second as we experience increasing rates we continue to believe each 25basis point increase in rates will generate in excess of million of pretax net interest income on an annualized basis which equates to approximately a 10basis point improvement in margin to be more specific on the margin ed mentioned for the quarter up basis points on our last call we suggested that the consensus rate forecast could result in the margin approaching by yearend with the more current consensus projections its likely well meet that target earlier than anticipated and may approach by yearend on the capital front despite very strong loan growth as a result of the common stock offering capital ratios improved with the higher rates and more typical loan growth the companys earnings are projected to result in further organic improvement to capital levels in the coming quarters lastly on a nonfinancial note the pandemic has accelerated the use of and really the importance of digital services at all banks and we show some statistics in the presentation portion of our documents this past weekend we successfully completed the full replacement of the digital banking system used by our consumer and certain small business clients this was a 15month effort and a significant investment on the part of the company this resulted in a very material upgrade to best in class feature functionality available to our clients it should differentiate us relative to all but our largest competitors and will only enhance the top tier service that wintrust banks are recognized to providing our clients and youll recall and also document in our presentation some of the recognition we received by jd power as the best bank for customer service in our area wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 with that ill turn it over to dave david l stoehr chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp great thanks tim as ed mentioned ill cover some of the income statement categories that are noteworthy starting with the net interest income for the second quarter of net interest income totaled million that was an increase of million as compared to the prior quarter and an increase of million as compared to the second quarter of last year the 385million increase in net interest income as compared to the prior quarter was due primarily to the net interest margin as average earning assets were essentially flat compared to the prior quarter the net interest margin improvement of basis points from the prior quarter brought us to a beneficial increase of basis points on the yield on earning assets and a 3basis point increase in the net free funds contribution combined with an offsetting 7basis point increase for the rates paid on liability resulted in the improved net interest margin the increase in the yield on earning assets as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a 26basispoint improvement on the loan yields and then higher liquidity management asset yields as the company earned higher rates on interestbearing cash that we hold at the fed the increase in the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities in the second quarter was driven by a 6basis point increase on the rate paid on interestbearing deposits turning to the provision for credit losses wintrust recorded provision for credit losses of million compared to a provision of million in the prior quarter and a 153million negative provision expense recorded in the yearago quarter now although the provision expense was higher in the second quarter i want to make clear that the increase was largely a result of providing for this quarters exceptional loan growth of approximately billion excluding the ppp loans so it wasnt really generated as a result of any widespread deterioration in the credit portfolio as the credit statistics remained very good and rich will cover that in more detail in just a few seconds edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp captain murphy you mean david l stoehr chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp captain murphy will cover that in a few seconds in the noninterest income section our wealth management revenue was flat with the prior quarter at million but up slightly from million from the yearago quarter given the volatility in the market were pleased with that result and consistent with overall industry trends the impact of higher home mortgage rates our mortgage banking operations had slightly lower loan origination volume during the second quarter however production revenue actually increased as the production margins rebounded to the range that we guided to last quarter however mortgage banking revenue decreased by million from the first quarter primarily due to the valuation changes related to mortgage servicing rights and early buyout loans guaranteed by the us government agencies which are also held at fair value this quarter the net of those two items was a million or benefit whereas last quarter that net benefit was million the company expects this portfolio of early buyout loans to continue to serve as a partial economic hedge of the mortgage servicing rights in future periods theyre essentially ginnie mae loans that are marktomarket wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 looking forward based on current pipeline activity market conditions we expect mortgage origination volumes to be lower in the third quarter than we just experienced in the second quarter however the impact of such decline on net earnings is expected to be relatively small relative to the anticipated growth in our net interest income and again to put that in perspective in our production revenue in the second quarter was about million servicing revenue was about million so even if theres a slight decline in the mortgage revenue from million after you pay out the commissions and the other expenses the net impact is could really only be a few million dollars excluding the msr valuation so weve sort of bottomed out or bottoming out on the mortgage revenues now and the impact is going to be relatively insignificant relative to the what we expect to be extraordinarily good growth in the net interest income turning to other categories we recorded investment losses as ed mentioned of million during the second quarter compared to net losses of million in the prior quarter it was related primarily to equity valuations being impacted by market conditions on a portion of our securities portfolio other noninterest income totaled million in the second quarter which was down million from the amount recorded in the prior quarter the primary reason for the decline in this category is the million losses associated with the properties that ed referred to and additionally the company realized million of lower swap fee revenue in the second quarter relative to the first quarter if we turn to noninterest expenses they totaled million in the second quarter and were up just or approximately million when compared to the prior quarter the primary reason for this is the seasonal increase in our marketing costs which were up million and a variety of other miscellaneous increases and decreases by categories that essentially offset each other with that being said ill just cover a few of the larger changes in the noninterest expense section first salaries and employee benefits expense decreased by million compared to the first quarter the current quarter decrease is primarily related to lower accruals associated with our longterm incentive compensation program relative to the prior quarter advertising and marketing expenses as i indicated was up million when compared to the prior quarter and as weve discussed on previous calls this category of expenses tends to be higher in the second and the third quarters of the year due primarily to our marketing and sponsorship expenditures related to various major league and minor league baseball sponsorships as well as the sponsorship of summertime events held in the communities we serve including the mackinac race that ed referred to earlier software and equipment expense totaled million in the second quarter this is an increase of million as compared to the first quarter the increase is due to increased expenses associated with upgrading and maintaining our it and information security infrastructure and further investments in digital products and services such as the upgrade that tim just referred to as weve done over the past few years we continue to invest in the software and technology to enhance our customer experience and delivery systems and products as well as invest in other systems to support our continued growth oreo expenses increased by million in the second quarter as the company recorded a gain of approximately million from the sale of oreo property in the prior quarter and only a small oreo gain in the current quarter although this category increased the total expense for the quarter was only wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 lendingrelated expenses were down approximately million from the prior quarter primarily as a result of lower mortgage banking related expenses and travel and entertainment expenses increased by million over the prior quarter as the work environment continues to revert back to prepandemic business customs and relationship managers are able to engage more routinely with clients and potential clients we consider the travel and entertainment activity as important to maintaining the strong loan growth that weve been achieving in the recent quarters other than the expense categories i just discussed all the other categories in the aggregate were up by about million compared to the first quarter the increase was impacted by a variety of other operational fluctuations including over million of cost related to the conversion of our digital banking platform that tim went over that just went live this week the net overhead ratio as ed mentioned stood at for the second quarter well its negatively impacted by the million of security losses and million of the property charges on an overall on a yeartodate basis however the net overhead ratio stood at so on summary the quarter actually was a solid quarter from a core fundamentals perspective it was negatively impacted by the security and property losses and by the higher provision but the higher provision perversely is good for the company as it related to strong outsized loan growth exceptional loan growth for the quarter other than that the loan growth and the expanding margin the strong pipelines and the good credit quality really set us up very well for the future quarters i will say as i will sort of reiterate one thing ed said we are very asset sensitive we do that by design understanding that when rates go up inflation probably increases too so we would expect some increases in the noninterest expenses during the quarter we would probably expect mortgages as i said to be down a little bit but we also dont expect to have the same security losses and property losses so noninterest income probably will be relatively stable but noninterest expenses will probably rise a little bit with wage pressure in the market but all of that will be insignificant we think relative to the increase in net income if the rate environment stays as is projected right now so with that i will conclude my lengthy comments here and turn it over to captain rich richard b murphy vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp thanks dave as noted earlier credit performance for the second quarter was very solid from a number of perspectives as detailed on slide of the deck loan growth for the quarter net of ppp was billion or annualized and just an outstanding result equally as important and similar to the past few quarters we continue to see loan growth across the portfolio id like to highlight a few key elements of this growth the second quarter is typically very strong for commercial premium finance and this quarter was no exception with loans up million up slightly from the million in the second quarter of life insurance premium finance continued to grow nicely with loans of million ci loans excluding ppp loans were up million driven by assetbased lending and leasing in addition residential real estate and core cre loans showed solid growth yearoveryear we saw total loan growth of billion or net of ppp loans as noted on prior earnings calls we continue to see very solid momentum in our core ci and cre portfolios pipelines have been very strong throughout this year and we saw that materialize into increased outstandings during the past several quarters wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 looking forward we continue to be optimistic about loan growth for the remainder of for a number of reasons core pipelines continue to be very strong with solid momentum in  commercial line utilization excluding leases and mortgage warehouse lines as detailed on slide continued to trend up from to and we anticipate this trend will continue also on slide you will see that business expansion and inflation pressures have resulted in many customers requesting increases to their credit facilities to help finance lease costs and as a result we have seen the level of unused credit facilities increase and both first insurance funding and wintrust life finance had another strong quarter and this momentum has been strong for several quarters and we believe it will continue through the remainder of the year as a result while macroeconomic conditions may pose a heightened level of uncertainty as tim noted were reaffirming our loan growth guidance of mid to highsingle digit growth from a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide we continue to see solid credit performance across the portfolio this can be seen in a couple of metrics while nonperforming loans increased from million or basis points to million or basis points this is still below the npl totals at yearend or at june of which were basis points and basis points respectively npls continue to be at very low levels and we are still confident about the solid credit metrics of the portfolio charge offs for the quarter were million or basis points up slightly from the previous quarter yeartodate charge offs totaled basis points and as detailed on slide we continue to see consistent levels in our special mentioned and substandard loans with no meaningful signs of economic stress at the customer level that concludes my comments on credit and ill turn it back to ed to wrap up edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you murphy allinall it was a pretty good quarter for us setting up the rest of the year very nicely great loan growth across the board and consistent pipelines for future growth are in place as murphy mentioned credit remains benign absolute npas indiscernible about of the current size so we are our current size right now indiscernible moving about expeditiously ph while in the the first two quarters and last not last quarter but first quarter and throughout fourth quarter last year we did some loan sales were looking to do some more of those loan demand is good as it is why not get rid of the bad and bring in the good market disruption still exists and we intend to take full advantage of it both the deposit and the loan side well you read that maybe one of our our competitors where some disruption is taking place and a conversion that didnt go as well as ours did i guess and we are hoping to get some business out of that were very wellpositioned for higher rates every quarter indiscernible forward to million over the following months increase in net interest income should dwarf any increase in expenses brought on by inflationary pressures we expect the fourth quarter margin as tim said to be in the to range and to still be growing rates continue to move up as we anticipate they will we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions but seller price expectations are still unrealistic in our opinion the two rate hikes and pressure on expenses brought about by inflation and tech investments required some of the banks the smaller banks looking at should bring some ph reasonable to these expectations in near future in general we dont like doing deals that are dilutive so were not going to change our approach wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 in general our customer is still seeing good things going on price increases are being readily accepted by our customers there are some some supply chain issues still exist but the main issue remains in getting good qualified people so our customers are feeling pretty darn good about where they are right now and still a lot of money in the system so well be very diligent in monitoring this were not afraid to act if things actually do turn for the worse we just dont see it yet so mortgages continue to slow and wealth management continues to make progress increase in the net interest income will far outweigh the loss of earnings from the mortgage area we continue to monitor expense growth to ensure the numbers do not get goofy technical term goofy in short we like where we stand and we like our prospects for the future with that we appreciate your support and you can be sure of our best efforts and time for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of chris mcgratty of kbw chris mcgratty your line is open q hey hows it going this is indiscernible on for chris mcgratty edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hey good morning q so on the margin youve talked about hitting by the end of the year im just wondering what fed funds rate and what your updated beta assumption is going to that number and how much incremental spend should we expect beyond that timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp well there are a couple of parts to your question there im not even sure i heard all of it but the were using the consensus forecast that has basis points in july and then equal increases in september and december obviously the july increase is most impactful to the margin for the remainder of the two latter increases meaningful for i think you had an expense question as well and dave ill let you handle that one david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah so the deposit beta we still are as we talked lagging right now and tim talked about with the rate increase next week therell probably be more pressure but were still looking at to betas ultimately on wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 the deposit portfolio well just have to see how the market reacts as far as competitive rate increases to see how fast that happens but ultimately thats still where we expect to be at q okay thank you and i said one more on loan growth you mentioned like you you reiterated your mid to highsingle digit loan growth guidance loan growth guidance youre currently at about annualized growth for the year so far is that mid to highsingle digit is that for the remainder of the year or for full year richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp for the remainder of the year i think if we look in the next quarter and in the fourth quarter as much as we can see that those are kind of the estimates we have for those quarters q okay and i guess with that would are there any areas that within the portfolio that youre expecting pullbacks in richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp pullbacks in terms of demand or pullback in terms of q in terms of growth yeah richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah i would think that with rising interest rates youre going to see more pressure on cre growth as its tougher to underwrite in a higher interest rate environment i also think that wintrust life is probably going to be more affected by rising interest rates as that product is much better in terms of in a lower interest rate environment you also may see weve had some decent portfolio growth here in residential mortgages that may be affected as well those would be the three areas that i would highlight but again i dont think thats going to be material effect materially affect our guidance edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah and next year well be adding some products in life insurance side were redoing the system on the life insurance business and well be able to offer lines of credit and things that we cant offer right now so we expect that business to continue to be vital we continue to rework it and were excited about the future there wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 q okay great thanks for answering my questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line terry mcevoy of stephens your line is open edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning everybody hope youre doing well maybe lets start with i guess the outlook for fee income i was a little bit surprised with the resiliency in wealth management kind of flat quarteroverquarter and given market conditions and maybe dave if you could just talk about some of the puts and the takes for your outlook for fees to be stable in the third quarter david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah so wealth management i mean probably was down a little bit as far as some of the assets under management but we also have other pieces there with our exchange business our chicago deferred exchange we refer to as cdec had a really strong quarter so that help offset some of the pressure on the other areas of the business some of those assets priced at the beginning in the quarter some priced at the end of the quarter so there may still be a little bit of pressure on the wealth business but not dramatic so there might be some pressure there as we said on mortgages there might be a little pressure there based upon the application volume we were seeing now but we dont expect to see another million of security losses we dont expect to see another million worth of properties that we dispose of so theres million right there of losses that you can never say never but we dont expect to have them so i think if you work your way through all of that then it should be relatively stable plus or minus terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then as a follow up question maybe if you could just talk about your hiring efforts given some of the market disruption im not going to ask from what financial institution they may come from but maybe what areas of the bank do you think you can add folks to given that disruption timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp hi terry its been largely on the commercial side as weve talked about in the past when lenders get concerned about their ability to take care of their clients they begin to explore their options and so we continue to see disruption some of it by announced transactions some of it by the integration efforts that occur over time so that tends to be more active during the kind of first twothirds of the year slows down as you get toward the end of the year but were excited both by some additions in the chicago area as well as a couple in wisconsin wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you very much operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of david long of raymond james david long your line is open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp how you doing david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good good hey deposit balances overall you were up a little bit in the quarter periodend to periodend just curious how youre thinking about overall deposit balances through the second half of the year do you think theres still some stimulusrelated fluff out there that could leave the bank or are you guys growing quick enough with new funds and new clients that you can offset that and grow deposits in the back half of the year timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah its a good question david we think consumers remain pretty healthy which is part of the reason we think economically things feel okay but the market has been very disciplined and people havent been moving rates much and so i think the second half of the year will depend a little bit on how some of our competitors react but left to our own devices we would plan to continue to grow deposits continue to add relationships and well work hard to fund some of the loan growth that we think will come in the second half of the year edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp david its like climbing a ladder you need loans you need deposit you need loans deposits were able to keep the costs down to date but indiscernible to premium rate to get some people indiscernible branches we wont have the cannibalization then what weve always done is gone out with the younger ones and the newer banks or branches that can go out and pay up a little bit to get full relationships and its worked well and now they can do it again with higher rates and kind of out of the red zone if you will use a football analogy so more field to play with so were going to continue to grow deposits very quickly as we can david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks guys appreciate that and then let me switch over to captain murphy reserve is still pretty healthy here but as youre as were seeing some increasing risk of a potential recession how are you thinking about the reserve level between now and the end of the year do you expect the reserve level as a percentage of loans to be much higher than where we are today wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp no the reserving as dave pointed out the reserve levels really are more a function of the growth as opposed to the edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp as a moodys hemorrhoid if the guy at moodys has hemorrhoids richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp right so as of this point were just not seeing risk rate migration in a negative way that thing wouldnt happen in the back half of the year if things were to change dramatically in terms of the economic environment but i think really just based at this point in time the provisioning levels really would be dictated by growth more than the economic environment but that could change maybe clearly theres a lot of prognostication as it relates to what the recession might look like and when it might happen but as of this moment in time were just not seeing a lot of effects within our portfolio david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp and as you know david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc okay david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp the allowance is based upon the life of loan concept with cecl so it is what it is right now and unless you see degradation in economic conditions that we think impact our portfolio like rich said the provisions should be based on growth so david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it got it thanks guys trying to sneak another one in here thinking about the net interest margin talking range maybe range is there a top on your net interest margin and is there a point where maybe libor is not moving as quickly as the rate hikes since the libor has gotten a head start here and then your deposit beta catches up so potentially do you hit or so and then it starts to level off edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i dont think so by the way libor is dead we cant use that anymore so but i think that if it gets really bad you see rates going to i doubt thats going to happen but i think that i would imagine that the indiscernible depending on how rates go if you go back to the old days probably it has to do with mix and demand and that sort of stuff too wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 so i think that were happy where it is right now and were going to have to think about where we start locking it in because we dont want to downside going forward were going to have the ability i think we havent had since really to hedge both sides of the earnings for a period of time so that we dont were not going to end up with rates go down to get slammed again so were already hard in work on that and use your help in picking the top we hit the top we want to know and you could call and tell us indiscernible david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp but dave the is really based upon the consensus forecast right now so i mean you could pick all sorts of different interest rate scenarios where rates like ed said would go up into the teens or something and we dont expect that to happen were dealing with what we see right now in front of us but it certainly could go higher and deposit betas as we talked about are low right now but will catch up at some point so lots of moving parts but we wouldnt guide you to where we think were at if we didnt see a clear pathway to that david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc cool thanks guys appreciate the color edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i dont think is the top i think is the issue david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp save the best for the last baby how are you doing jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you im good just that it may not matter that much but i heard a couple of things on the margin guide i heard by the end of the year and then i heard to for the fourth quarter it may not audio gap matter much but what are you guys really trying to say wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp i think deposit cost a little bit we just dont know through the end of the year but we again given the consensus forecast we think approaching is certainly within range and if deposit pricing remains pretty muted maybe we do a little better jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and i guess the message for the third quarter is a similar type step up from what we just saw especially if it gets million next week timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yes jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then i want to push you guys a little on loan growth as well murphy you answered this a little bit earlier but you guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp captain murph please timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp captain murph jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc captain murph im sorry im sorry you did in the quarter and youve got period end thats higher than average by over billion and is the message dont expect this kind of growth again in  and it should materially slow from here or is the message that this can continue at the current range that youre in that you just put up this past quarter richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah id be surprised if we continued in the third quarter we were pleasantly surprised in  part of it as i said was  was is definitely affected by the pc portfolio being up million there really drove a lot of that growth we also saw the life portfolio and portfolio mortgages be higher than what we anticipated the growth in pc in the third quarter last year i think will be very similar to what weve seen in  here which was up but well off  total so i would be i do think that will be significantly down from where we were in  because of that but i think again i think well be in that guidance but maybe at the upper end of the range wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc how about billion would you say richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah i mean i would say somewhere in that billion number wed be but who knows until we get months ago so indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah it sounds like its the clients plus the market share shift thats driving all of this if thats fair richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah oh i mean i think thats right jon i mean one of the things that i kind of highlighted in my comments is that that core ci activity has been a real meaningful contributor to the growth and were seeing a lot of disruption in the marketplace and thats not going away so that core growth is really an important part of the story david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp and part of that jon is our pipelines are pretty stable but our unused commitments are up quite a bit so as some of those commitments start to get drawn down thats sort of a hidden growth thing outside of even our pipeline numbers so and as rich said in his comments we expect that unused line or that line usage to go up so lots of good things out there its just sort of hard to gauge the customer activity on a linear sort of basis jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay and then i understand the commentary on that strong nii growth i think you used that were just outrunning expense growth but dave any other color or help in terms of how material you expect the expense pressures to be david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp well i think that the biggest area sort of is in the is in the labor side of the equation you may have saw that we just announced that effective august well take our minimum wage book rate from to per share and that will have some impact we saw our filling positions open positions and making progress there but that will continue to add and if we really do stepup earnings as we think based upon the growth and the margin expansion well probably have some more incentive compensation out there probably some offsets with some less mortgage expenses as we saw this quarter as you saw on the lending side those were down a couple of million dollars theres probably a little bit more that comes out of there but wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 we were at i just dont think well be in the anymore i think that number has got to go up because of the wage inflation thats going on but we certainly will try to control it as best as possible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital
