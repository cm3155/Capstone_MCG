unearned insurance premium from the table start table end insurance company and forward it to first insurance funding or fifc canada in the event of a default by the borrower this lending involves relatively rapid turnover of the loan portfolio and high volume of loan originations because the agent or broker is the primary contact to the ultimate borrowers who are located nationwide and because proceeds and our collateral may be handled by the agent or brokers during the term of the loan first insurance funding and fifc canada may be more susceptible to third party ie agent or broker fraud

primary collateral by challenging the validity of the insurance contract for lack of an insurable interest wintrust life finance believes it has strong counterclaims against any such claims by carriers in addition to recourse to borrowers and guarantors as well as to additional collateral in certain cases premium finance loans made by first insurance funding wintrust life finance and fifc canada are primarily secured by the insurance policies financed by the loans these insurance policies are written by a large number of insurance companies geographically dispersed throughout the united states and canada our premium finance receivables balances finance insurance policies that are spread among a large number of insurers however one of the insurers represents approximately of such balances and two additional insurers represent approximately each of such balances first insurance funding wintrust life finance and fifc canada consistently monitor carrier ratings and financial performance of our carriers in the event carrier ratings fall below certain levels most of wintrust life finances life insurance premium finance policies provide for an event of default and allow wintrust life finance to have recourse to borrowers and guarantors as well as to additional collateral in certain cases for the commercial premium finance business the term of the loans is sufficiently short such that in the event of a decline in carrier ratings first insurance funding or fifc canada as the case may be can restrict or eliminate additional loans to finance premiums to

in operating expenses and expanded the wintrust asset finance direct leasing niche our strategy and competitive position for each of our business segments is summarized in further detail below community banking we compete in the commercial banking industry through our banks in the communities they serve the commercial banking industry is highly competitive and the banks face strong direct competition for deposits loans and other financial related services the banks compete with other commercial banks thrifts credit unions stockbrokers governmentsponsored entities mutual fund companies insurance companies factoring companies and other commercial entities offering financial services products including nonbank financial companies and entities commonly known as financial technology companies some of these competitors are local while others are statewide or nationwide as a billion asset financial services company we expect to benefit from greater access to financial and managerial resources than our smaller local competitors while maintaining our commitment to local decisionmaking and to our community banking philosophy in particular we are able to provide a wider product selection and larger credit facilities than many of our smaller competitors and we believe our service offerings help us in recruiting talented staff we continue to add lenders throughout the community banking organization many of whom have joined us because of our ability to offer a range of products and level of services which compete effectively with both larger and smaller market participants we have continued to expand our product delivery systems including a wide variety of electronic banking options for our retail and commercial customers which allow us to provide a level of service typically associated with much larger banking institutions additionally we have access to public capital markets whereas many of our local competitors are privately held and may have limited capitalraising capabilities management views service as a great equalizer to offset some of the inherent advantages of its significantly larger competitors we also believe we are positioned to compete effectively with other larger and more diversified banks bank holding companies and other financial services companies due to the multichartered approach that pushes accountability for building a franchise and a high level of customer service down to each of our banking franchises additionally we believe that we provide a relatively complete portfolio of products that is responsive to the majority of our customers needs through the retail and commercial operations supplied by our banks and through our mortgage and wealth management operations the breadth of our product mix allows us to compete effectively with our larger competitors while our multichartered approach with local and accountable management provides for what we believe is superior customer service relative to our larger and more centralized competitors we continue to grow and enhance our digital service offerings while maintaining our expectations of high quality more traditional banking services wintrust mortgage competes with large mortgage brokers as well as other banking organizations consolidation margin compression enhanced regulatory guidance and the promise of equal oversight for both banks and independent mortgage lenders have created challenges for small and mediumsized independent mortgage lenders wintrust mortgages size bank affiliation regulatory competency branding technology business development tools and reputation make us well positioned to compete in this environment our continued ability to retain the majority of servicing on loans sold including those loans sold to the companys banks allows wintrust mortgage to continue to grow a more stable revenue stream while earnings will fluctuate with the rise and fall of longterm interest rates we expect that mortgage banking revenue will be a continuous source of revenue for us and our mortgage lending relationships will continue to provide franchise value to our other financial service businesses we continue to review our branch footprint and in the company opened one new branch location in its florida market area and closed one branch location in the chicago metropolitan area there was no material attrition or customer disruption in connection with these footprint changes it is important to note that while we see increased use of electronic services and are investing heavily in digital capabilities to allow clients to choose how they want to be served wintrust will continue to selectively open branches in areas where we are not represented table start table end specialty finance first insurance
