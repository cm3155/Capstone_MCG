quarterly and full year revenue growth and earnings for thanks to the efforts of dedicated and talented colleagues around the globe we also provided revenue and eps guidance for and we announced a new growth plan that resets our longerterm aspirations for revenue and eps growths to levels that are higher than what we were delivering in the years before the pandemic i want to spend my time today talking about why these results and our progress over the last few years has me excited about the future and our aspiration to deliver higher levels of sustainable profitable growth as weve seen in our results for  and the full year the capabilities weve built over the past few years by investing in our customers our brand and our talent are helping us drive share scale and relevance that leads to profitable growth and we believe that will continue as the global economy continues to improve our strong performance across a number of key business metrics helped deliver revenue growth of in the fourth quarter and for the full year diluted eps for the quarter was and for the full year in the near term we expect full year revenue growth to remain at elevated levels reaching to in driven by the execution of our growth plan and the recovery tailwinds we anticipate from continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment we expect eps of between and in american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 as we think about the continuation of the recovery tailwinds could drive revenue growth in the midteens which in turn should provide a platform for midteens eps growth looking further out as we return to a more steadystate economic environment we aspire to achieve revenue growth in excess of and eps growth in the midteens under our new growth plan for and beyond we learned a lot over the past few years that we believe will help us achieve our growth plan aspirations the business imperatives and strategies we focused on prepandemic the decisions we made when covid19 first hit to protect our customers and colleagues and our pivot early in the recovery cycle to ramp up investments in a number of key areas all proved to be the right moves that have been good for our business most importantly our experience through this period has reinforced our conviction that investing strategically in our customers brand and talent is absolutely critical to driving high levels of growth weve seen that play out in the results we delivered throughout our fourth quarter performance continued the trends we saw all year in a number of areas that are core to our growth over the long term spending growth reached a record quarterly high driven by continued increases in goods and services spending which was above prepandemic levels global consumer goods and services spending in the quarter grew versus and we saw continued robust growth in small business b2b spending which increased over  levels overall te spending also continued to improve reaching of prepandemic levels driven by stronger consumer travel spending customer retention and satisfaction continue to be very strong and remained above prepandemic levels for example retention rates in global consumer are above and for the second year in a row and the eleventh time in years we ranked first in jd powers annual credit card satisfaction study of us consumers credit performance also continued to be outstanding with key metrics near historical lows and our card members are building loan balances at a modest pace customer engagement with our products services and capabilities continued at high levels in the quarter the strong engagement which is fueled by our ongoing investments in value propositions marketing and new digital services is helping to drive the results i just spoke about in billings and loan growth as well as customer retention and satisfaction levels additionally our customerfocused innovation strategy which has driven increases in customer engagement has continued to attract large numbers of new customers new card acquisitions reached million in  driven by strong demand for our premium feebased products where we saw acquisitions nearly double yearoveryear in consumer millennials and genz customers are driving the growth in acquisitions representing around of the new accounts we acquired globally in in commercial  closed out as one of the best years weve ever seen for us sme new account acquisition the momentum we generated throughout further strengthens our resolve to continue our focus on the strategic imperatives we laid out back in expanding our leadership position in the premium consumer space by providing a differentiated and an everexpanding range of services and lifestylefocused value proposition building on our strong leadership position in commercial payments by being the key provider of payments and working capital solutions for small and mediumsize businesses expanding our merchant network globally to give our card members more places to use their cards and staying on the leading edge of technology and digital payment solutions to make american express an essential part of our customers digital lives american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 were entering in a position of strength and based on the momentum with which we exited and the opportunities we see ahead we feel very good about the future we believe that continuing our strategy of investing at high levels in our customers brand and talent as we implement our growth plan will position us well as we seek to achieve our growth aspirations in and beyond ill now turn it over to jeff to provide more details on our performance for the fourth quarter and our expectations for the future and after that well take your questions thank you jeff jeffrey c campbell vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well thank you steve and good morning everyone its great to be here to talk about our fourth quarter and full year results the ambitious new growth plan that steve just talked about and what it all means for and beyond you see the growth momentum that steve just discussed in our summary financials on slide with fourth quarter revenues of billion up and full year revenues of billion up both on an fxadjusted basis in understanding our full year net income of billion and earnings per share of i would point out that we had around billion of significant impacts from items that we do not expect to repeat in the same magnitude going forward including a billion credit reserve release benefit in provision as well as a few sizable net gains on equity investments getting into a more detailed look at our results lets start with volumes youll notice in the several views of volumes on slides through that we continue to show volume trends on both a yearoveryear basis and relative to there are a few key insights that i would highlight across these slides that strengthen our conviction in the investment strategy we have been focused on to deliver our new growth plan to start we saw record levels of spending on our network in both the fourth quarter and full year with total network volumes and billed business volumes both up more than relative to on an fxadjusted basis in the fourth quarter as you can see on slide this growth in billed business as shown on slides and is being driven by continued momentum in spending on goods and services which strengthened sequentially and grew versus in  this momentum is from the strong growth in online and cardnotpresent spending that continued throughout even as offline spending fully recovered and resumed growth demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral changes weve seen during the pandemic importantly this growth versus in  represents a cumulative growth rate over the past two years that is well above the growth rate we were seeing prepandemic in our consumer business our focus on attracting and engaging younger cohorts of card members through expanding our value propositions and digital capabilities is fueling the growth in spending from our millennial and genz customers you see on slide and spending from all other age cohorts also showed steady improvement throughout and exceeded prepandemic levels in  our strategic focus on helping our small and mediumsize enterprise clients run their businesses by expanding the range of products and capabilities that meet their b2b payments and working capital needs is driving the strong sme spending trends you see on slide global sme spending particularly b2b spending on goods and services has been driving the growth of our commercial billed business throughout and reached above prepandemic levels in  american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 now turning to te spending you can see on slide that it continues to recover in line with our expectations with overall te spending reaching of levels in the fourth quarter we did see some modest impacts from the omicron variant in te spending as the pace of recovery slowed a bit in december but even with that modest slowdown us consumer te was not only fully recovered in the fourth quarter but actually grew above levels on balance the te trends we have seen throughout reinforces our view that travel and entertainment spending will eventually fully recover but at varying paces across customer types and geographies and we remain focused on maintaining our leadership position in offering differentiated travel and lifestyle benefits to our consumer and commercial customers as they return to travel finally on slide you see that our billed business momentum continues to be led by the us where spending improved sequentially throughout and grew above levels in the fourth quarter international billed business has also shown continued steady though smaller improvement with spending almost fully recovered in  importantly though growth in goods and services spending continues to be strong both in the us and outside of the us so what do all of these takeaways mean for and beyond most importantly we expect the strong momentum in goods and services spending to continue given the investments weve made in premium card member engagement prospect acquisition value propositions that particularly appeal to our millennial genz and sme customers growing our coverage and expanding relationships with key partners for te we expect the total global consumer and sme te spending will be fully recovered by the end of led by the growth in the us the recovery will be slower for the international and crossborder components of the spend and weve also long said that large and global corporate te spending would be the last to recover across our customer types so these spending types may represent a steady tailwind in both and as they gradually recover moving on to receivable and loan balances on slide we are seeing good sequential growth in our lending balances but it is led by spending and so the portion of our lending balances that are revolving is recovering more slowly because our balances are spenddriven we do expect to continue to see a strong rebound with loan balances surpassing levels in but we expect it to take more time for the interestbearing portion of these balances to rebuild as paydown rates continue to remain elevated due to the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base turning next to credit and provision on slides through as you flip through these slides therere a few key points id like you to takeaway most importantly we continue to see extremely strong credit performance with card member loans and receivables writeoff and delinquency rates remaining around historical lows as loan balances begin to rebuild more meaningfully we do expect delinquency and loss rates to slowly move up over time but we expect them to remain below prepandemic levels in the strong credit performance combined with continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook throughout drove a billion provision expense benefit for the full year as the low writeoffs were fully offset by the reserve releases as shown on slide as you see on slide we ended with billion of reserves representing of our loan balances and of our card member receivable balances respectively this is well below the reserve levels we had pre pandemic given the strong credit performance weve seen in we will be growing over the billion american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 reserve release benefit we saw in since i would not expect to see reserve releases of the same magnitude going forward in fact depending on credit trends and the pace at which our balance sheet grows its possible we may need to build some modest level of reserves moving next to revenues on slide total revenues were up yearoveryear in the fourth quarter up for the full year this is well above our original expectations for the year driven by the successful execution of our investment strategy and it is part of what emboldens us to launch our new growth plan before i get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides i would note that other fees and commissions and other revenue were both up yearoveryear in the fourth quarter and for the full year primarily driven by the uptick in travelrelated revenues we began to see in the second half of these travel related revenues still remain well below levels however and their complete recovery will likely lag and be a tailwind into along with international and crossborder travel turning to our largest revenue line discount revenue on slide you see it grew yearoveryear in  and for the full year on an fxadjusted basis this growth is primarily driven by the momentum in goods and services spending we saw throughout net card fee revenues have grown consistently throughout the pandemic and for the full year of were up yearoveryear and up versus as you can see on slide the resiliency of these subscription like revenues demonstrates the impact of the investments weve made in our premium value propositions and the continued attractiveness of those value propositions to both prospects and existing customers as a result i expect net card fee growth to accelerate from these already high growth rates in turning to net interest income on slide you can see that it was up yearoveryear in the fourth quarter this is the second consecutive quarter of yearoveryear growth as we clearly hit an inflection point in the second half of the growth in net interest income is slower than the growth in lending ar due to the strong liquidity demonstrated by our customers that i spoke about earlier which is leading to both our historicallylow credit costs and to high paydown rates that are driving lower net interest yields and a slower recovery in revolving loan balances looking ahead we expect net interest income to be a tailwind to our revenue growth in and likely due to the slower recovery in revolving loan balances so to sum up on revenues the successful execution of our investment strategy has driven the revenue recovery momentum you see on slide looking forward into we expect to see revenue growth of to driven by the continued strong growth in spend and card fee revenues and the lingering recovery tailwinds from net interest income and travelrelated revenues the revenue momentum we saw in was clearly accelerated by the investments weve made in marketing value propositions technology and people and those investments show up across the expense line as you see on slide starting with variable customer engagement expenses at the top of slide there are a few things to think about most importantly the investments we are making in our premium value propositions are resonating with our customers and this of course is driving growth in these expense lines in addition over the course of the pandemic we added some temporary incremental benefits to many of our premium products in an effort we refer to as value injection because our customers were not able to take advantage of many of the travelrelated aspects of our value propositions the costs of this value injection effort generally showed up in the marketing expense line american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 throughout we gradually wound down the value injection offers as our customers were again engaging more with the travel aspects of our value propositions as well as with the new rewards and benefits we introduced through recent product refreshes this is all a good thing in terms of our longterm customer retention growth prospects it does however mean you see more yearoveryear growth in these variable customer engagement costs putting all these dynamics together id expect variable customer engagement costs overall to run at around of total revenues in moving to the bottom of the slide operating expenses were just over billion for full year and in line with in understanding our opex results however its important to point out that we benefited from million in net marktomarket gains in our amex ventures strategic investment portfolio in and that these gains are reported in the opex line we also increased investments in the critical areas of technology and our talented colleague base in and expect to continue to grow investments in these areas this year for we expect our operating expenses to be a bit over billion and we see these costs as a key source of leverage relative to our much higher level of revenue growth last our effective tax rate for was around and id expect a similar effective tax rate in absent any legislative changes turning next to our marketing investments we are making to build growth momentum you can see on slide that we invested around billion in marketing in the fourth quarter and billion for the full year as we continued to ramp up new card acquisitions while winding down our value injection efforts we acquired million new cards up yearoveryear steve emphasized the critical point however that in particular we see great demand for our premium feebased products with new accounts acquired on these products almost doubling yearoveryear and representing of the new accounts acquired in the quarter acquisitions of new us consumer and small business platinum card members were at all times highs this year with  being a record quarter of new account acquisitions from both of these refreshed products much more importantly though than just the total number of cards we focus internally on the overall level of spend and fee revenue growth we bring on from these new acquisitions we are pleased to see that the revenues from 2021s acquisitions are trending significantly stronger than what we saw prepandemic looking forward we expect to spend around billion in marketing in turning next to capital on slide we returned billion of capital to our shareholders in including common stock repurchases of billion and billion in common stock dividends on the back of a starting excess capital position and strong earnings generation as a result we ended the year with our cet1 ratio back within our target range to in  and another sign of our growing confidence in our growth prospects we expect to increase our dividend by around to and to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth that brings me to our growth plan on slide and then well open up the call for your questions the combination of our prepandemic strategies our learnings from the pandemic and the strong momentum we have achieved have all come together to embolden us to announce our new growth plan what does that mean financially in the nearer term we expect our revenue growth to be significantly higher than our longterm aspiration due to the range of pandemicrecovery tailwinds that ive talked about throughout my remarks which is why we have given guidance of to revenue growth american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 weve also given eps guidance for of to we feel good about this earnings guidance as the momentum we have built on the revenue side helps us to grow over the number of notable items that benefited our results that we certainly dont expect to repeat in the same magnitude in as i discussed at the very beginning of my remarks this morning our guidance does assume an economy that will continue to improve and reflects what the we know today about the regulatory and competitive environment it also assumes that based on current exchange rates we would not see a significant impact from fx in our reported revenue growth in in we expect our revenue growth to remain above our longterm aspirational targets due to the lingering recovery tailwinds which should create a platform for producing midteens eps growth longer term as we get to a more steadystate macro environment we have an aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of and midteens eps growth on a sustainable basis in and beyond in closing we are committed to executing against our new growth plan and well be running the company with a focus on achieving our accelerated growth aspirations with that ill turn the call back over to vivian vivian y zhou senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co thank you jeff before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open the line for questions alan question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hey ryan jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 so its good to hear about the betterthanexpected 2024plus longterm aspirations for in excess of revenue growth and midteens eps growth so steve i was maybe hoping you can maybe just talk about what is allowing you to drive this better structural growth is it the investments youre making the brand resonating more with investors and what are the key drivers and clearly youre investing heavily in the near term jeff mentioned higher variable engagement cost can you maybe just talk about what should give investors confidence that as we get to the business is going to be able to drive operating leverage versus historically a view of reinvesting a lot into the business and just lastly one point of clarification jeff can you just clarify the platform for midteens eps growth were you mentioning that you expect midteens in or more than it was positioning you well for midteens within thanks jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well maybe well work backwards steve indiscernible i think the language on around eps growth ryan is meant to make the point that we are certainly given the tailwind is going to drive again very high revenue growth and that creates a great platform for steady earnings growth the caution there is just you still have some volatility in how credit reserves may play out and so when you think about sort of the total level of earnings in and i feel pretty confident could you have some result that moves reserve releases between one year and another which skew the actual yearoveryear growth number a bit you might but i think the core earnings power will be there given the high revenue growth that steves going to talk about next stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah but just to just talk about the operating leverage for a second too because when you look at and jeff mentioned that we had sort of indiscernible operating expense with the venture gains this year when you look at that you will have operating expense leverage growth this particular year because youre looking at to revenue growth and if you sort of even if you dont normalize it youre going to have a much higher revenue growth than you will so were still going to drive operating expense growth throughout this throughout our journey but let me talk to you about what gives me the confidence and when i look at sort of what weve done over the last four years where we are now and how were exiting what i would sum this up as its a combination of three things it is the strategy that weve put in place it is the secular tailwinds that we have and the momentum and im going to start from the back and work my way forward look at the momentum i mean youve got revenue growth in this particular quarter youve got million cards that we acquired youve got historically high billings growth we havent gotten into this but we see travel bookings when we looked at travel bookings in the fourth quarter it was up over when we look at the first couple of weeks in january were up over so we have tremendous momentum entering and ill move to the beginning and go to the strategy we ph to be back in and i made this in my remarks we talked about being the premium card provider and i think the skepticism was for millennials and genz that skepticism from my perspective is over of the cards that we acquired are millennials and genz in this quarter of our premium cards were millennials and then the next strategic imperative was sme we had probably the best sme acquisition year that weve ever had we talked about our ability to be in peoples digital lives we had online spending growth over and we had online spending growth just over american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 last year and look at what weve done from a merchant perspective were at parity in the us and we added over million merchants just last year internationally and look at the secular tailwinds i think the pandemic has moved online spending forward for three to five years and were getting more than our fair share and then look at our business were at of the overall our te business from now consumer is doing really well in the fourth quarter we were up but the rest of the rest of it is below levels and so we believe from a te perspective weve got more room to go when we look at our as we segment our card members millennials are blowing it out we had over spending from millennials and genz increased over both and and as we look at sort of our our genx is up and our boomers are not and our boomers traditionally are the ones that travel and have money and once we get from pandemic to endemic here theyre going to start traveling again jeff talked about modest loan balances that will grow over time which is the comment he made about some reserve increases but were going to get back to where we were well look at international consumer international consumer tends to be a more traveling card member and that business is flat and large and global has not come back and ill leave you with this on large and global people are skeptical about business travel because of all the remote workforce in fact i think business travel is going to be completely different and i think as you have more people in more remote locations they may need to get together three four maybe five times a year to come to headquarters or to come to locations where they never had to come to before and lets face it we all realize that theres nothing better than sitting in front of your customers and i just came back from an opportunity at the amex golf tournament to sit in front of a lot of my customers so when we look at these secular tailwinds thats why we believe its not only doable but sustainable as we move forward ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for taking my questions and apologies for packing so many in there stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co alan vivian y zhou a senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co alan operator our next question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 good morning betsy jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to dig in a little bit more on some of the opportunities that you were discussing when i sit from my seat im wondering what type of penetration do you think you have in the us millennial and genz the numbers you just quoted were very impressive but im wondering do you feel youre at of that market or give us a sense as to how youre thinking about that and in addition on the sme side where youre the clear leader wheres the room for you to run is it by increasing the product set ie either revolving line of credit that you recently announced or is it more in acquiring new customers and really the question is whats the tam and what percentage of that tam do you think you have right now in the various customer sets thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so let me start and jeff can sort of jump in look from a millennial perspective i dont know exactly where we are but what i could tell you is were not at the id be closer to the than the but millennials and genz so i think theres a lot of opportunity and a lot of runway and maybe at investor day well try and give you some guidance on that and well do a little bit of work on that from an sme perspective look we are thats right we are the clear leader from an sme perspective and i think when you look at the opportunity set what weve said from an sme perspective is we want to be the total working capital provider and so you look at what weve done what weve done is weve gone out there and now weve created with the acquisition of kabbage weve created our we have the checking account we have the debit card and the checking account is important because thats where all the flows of money come in and go out from a card perspective weve always been in great shape from a revolve perspective on the card we dont have the same share that weve had and so well push a little bit more on that revolve and obviously on the working capital loans and some of the other term loans well be pushing on as well so we think when you put that together holistically we have a lot of room for growth from an sme perspective not only in the us but in international where we leverage our international corporate card business and our position from a consumer perspective to go after it so we think both of those areas are still very very ripe to grow operator our next question will come from mihir bhatia with bank of america go ahead please mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thank you for taking my question stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hey mihir american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc i just wanted to ask maybe we can talk a little bit more about variable expenses specifically what im wondering is just your guide actually seems to imply a little bit of operating leverage in that line item for next year which just compared to this year and im wondering what is driving that maybe you can give a little bit more color on the internal lines within that the three different line items in there jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co you know mihir i didnt get the very first part of your question mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc oh im sorry i was saying your guidance of of variable expenses as a percent of revenue is like lower than right so i was just trying to understand maybe a little bit more which line items there is it the business development line or services like what would be driving that jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co yeah okay im sorry so theres a few things to think about when you think about that remember to start with we started giving you this percentage because it was an easy way in a very volatile time during the pandemic to help people think about all three of these lines as you think about next year id point out a number of our revenue lines are recovering more slowly we talked about net interest income we talked about other fees and commissions and other revenues because a lot of thats travel related so in many ways because spend has come back more robustly because we are seeing great engagement from our customers with both our reward programs and our many card member services those engagement behaviors are causing those costs to come back more quickly than of the revenues are coming back so really in many ways one of the reasons were very bullish about both and revenue growth being above our longterm aspiration is because you have this steady recovery as the other revenues recover the other thing id point out mihir is that back to steves comment on learnings from the pandemic and the investments we have made in our value propositions are clearly paying off when you look at our revenue growth when you look at our acquisition results and when you look at our retention and so boy i would say it is a learning for us from the pandemic that investing as you see in that is the right thing to do to create a great platform for longterm growth for the company operator our next question will come from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning steve and jeff stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 good morning bill jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co hey bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc so amex was one of the few financials if not the only to not cut its dividend during the global financial crisis steve how important to you is sustainability of the dividend did that factor into your decision to increase it by and i guess what do you view as an optimal level for your dividend payout jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well what id say bill is the dividend is important to us its important to many of our shareholders and the fact that were raising it for the first time since is a sign that in our view its time to be on the offense again and i feel confident about our growth all of that said we have a longstanding policy of having a payout that is around to on the dividend with tremendous growth in earnings this year and what we expect next year or in weve fallen a little bit behind that and so were catching up really to that level but thats what shareholders should expect going forward so the dividend will grow over time as our earnings grow but youre not going to see it grow incrementally as a payout percentage stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co but i think going back to the financial crisis bill it was important to show the stability and just the resilience of the company during that time and that was an important signal to our shareholders i believe and it showed our commitment to it so thats about it operator our next question will come from chris donat with piper sandler please go ahead stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co chris vivian y zhou a senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co chris stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co chris christopher donat q analyst piper sandler co can you hear me american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co now we can now we can sorry chris operator mr donat i think you have some trouble with your line if you could please pick up your handset check your mute feature im sorry weve lost mr donats line well go next to moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks i just wanted to kind of focus a little bit on the cost side i mean you did the revenue guides very strong clearly and probably billion to billion above where consensus expectations were for but i believe the high end of the eps guidance is kind of where consensus is so it sort of implies i guess between credit and costs of roughly billion more in there is there a way to kind of think about which the big categories are because so that we can have a better idea of how that operating leverage post that kind of comes through thanks jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co boy moshe ill admit you were fading in and out a little bit so im going to take a shot at what i think you just asked i think when you look at our eps guidance i actually the first point i would make would be to point people back to the revenue guidance right so were all about growth and growing our revenues another to on top of the growth that we just showed in the fourth quarter we think is creating the kind of scaled platform that is the best platform for creating value in the long term for our shareholders second point id make when you think about earnings is as i said at the beginning of my remarks you had around billion of pretax items in the earnings that i dont expect to repeat so billion of credit reserve releases i think were closer to a steadystate position on that another billion on marktomarket gains on both our fintech portfolio and our global business travel joint venture and so we look at our earnings guidance and see ourselves growing over that billion while making the investments that steve talked about in customers brand and colleagues to drive to revenue growth boy and we feel really good about that outcome and we think it creates a great platform for longterm sustainable growth stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah i mean look simplistically take the billion off the lets call it call it so we see it going from that number to ph to and as weve always said we thought wed be at the top end of the range of our plan and the guidance that weve given uses the top end of our range as the bottom end of our range so we think its from a pure operating perspective we think its a lot of operating eps in you guys can decide whether you believe that or not but the numbers are the numbers operator well once again go back to the line of chris donat with piper sandler please go ahead christopher donat q analyst piper sandler co hi can you hear me this time american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co we can very clearly christopher donat q analyst piper sandler co okay thats a good better thing just wanted to ask around discount rate if that factors in as one of the tailwinds you expect going forward as we think about the mix of your te businesses and the discount rates there and also with gs and even online do you pick up any tailwinds from expected mix shift in business with the recovery stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co probably not i mean because goods and services are growing so dramatically our traditional mix of business was goods and services and te we may wind up being at a steadystate of and so obviously as te does come back and were at of where we were in thats a positive to the overall discount rate but goods and services tends to be a little bit lower but look at the end of the day were driving discount revenue here and thats what were focused on and so were very happy with the goods and services growth and particularly the online and what i would point out is not only is online growing but offline is growing as well and its growing tremendously over but when you look at it over i mean even offline retail for us is up over so youve got a combination of online online retail up over youve got offline up so we feel really good about how our card members are using the products operator well go to the line of bob napoli for our next question with william blair go ahead robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc hi thank you and good morning indiscernible stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hey bob robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc good morning steve good morning jeff so one of your competitors a large bank i guess targeted lower returns because of the need for tech investment to compete against i guess fintechs indiscernible but what is your thought on the what kind of investments you have built in how do you feel about the american express tech stack and the need to invest and i guess as it relates to maybe blockchain and cryptocurrency potential disruptors to payment rails and buynowpaylater its a disruptor to credit cards stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well thats a lot bob american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc sorry stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co look i think and you and i have talked about this before look weve continued to invest in our technology stack over time and as you know i used to run technology many years ago and weve been committed to constantly refreshing our tech stack and making those investments and this year is no other and its not its not anymore than its been in years past i mean from a tech development perspective i would say were flattish as we think about up a little bit here or there and from a tech operations perspective you keep taking advantage of scale and the reduce cost and then of course you then pivot more money into cyber because thats constantly where youll overall invest look as far as buynowpaylater and again ive made these comments many many times i do not believe this is targeted at our customers look we have pay it plan it and pay it plan it is we believe in offering our customers the opportunity to be as flexible with their payments as possible and it gives you the ability to pick your installments and pay it over time and weve had some increasing usage here but its not a major driver of our growth and if you look at the other types of buynowpaylater the payinfour geez the reality is the charge card is almost a payinfour because by the time you pay your on average your charge card off or your credit card in a nonrevolve basis you could be at days anyways so and when weve looked at sort of buynow paylater and that target audience it tends to be lower fico it tends to be debit card users and it tends to be utilized potentially as an acquisition tool and thats just not how we play our game so im not that all concerned with buynowpaylater i think there are some successful companies out there that are driving some revenue and are driving a lot of volume through buynowpaylater but again we look at it as an option with our pay it plan it and the nice part about pay it plan it is its not at the pointofsale because you can you can do it to any transaction it doesnt just have to be at the pointofsale where not everybody has a buynowpaylater feature so thats that as far as cryptocurrency goes look we watch cryptocurrencies and you guys have heard me talked about this we think about the spectrum of digital currencies we think about crypto we think about stablecoins we think about central bank digital currency and at this particular point in time we view more cryptocurrency as an asset class i mean youve just seen bitcoin go from a coin to a coin currencies that you use in the payment space thats a hard thing to utilize that way and as far as blockchain look weve got investments in blockchain companies we constantly look at blockchain and figure out are there use cases for us and as far as stablecoins and nfts and things like that were partnering with obviously the nba and top shop and well look at ways to get involved but as ive said were probably not going to offer a crypto card doesnt mean we wouldnt use mr as a redemption option and ive said many times its a digital currency in itself so we keep our eye on it keep our eye on buynowpaylater in case that in case that tide changes we keep our eye on cryptocurrency in case it becomes more stable but right now i dont see it as a immediate or a mediumterm threat to our business operator our next question will come from arren cyganovich with citi go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks i wonder if you can talk a little bit about your capital return plans for next year obviously nice increase in the dividend but youre at your cet1 target or within the range now at where do you think buybacks go from here particularly since youre starting to grow your receivable balances by a decent amount jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well were pretty committed to staying within that to range on the cet1 ratio when i talked earlier about the dividend will go up steadily as our earnings go up the thing to keep in mind though is that we pretty uniquely also generate returns on equity in recent years in excess of so we produce a tremendous amount of capital each year far more than we need to support the growth in our very spendcentric business model and the balance sheet that results from that so youll continue to see a steady level of share repurchase from us each quarter consistent with that kind of earnings generation and that kind of roe and staying within our to range clearly though the big catchup has been the last two quarters where you saw what i will call above trend levels of share repurchase to get us right back down to that target range operator well go next to rick shane with jpmorgan go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks guys for taking my questions this morning stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hey rick richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc look one of the things thats come up repeatedly is the strength of the millennial genz growth when you look towards your revenue growth guidance how much is embedded related to the sort of lifecycle of a younger consumer and the growth that you would expect there how does that play out over time jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well i think when you see us very uncharacteristically rick talking about longterm aspirations in and beyond a key part of that aspiration is looking at the demographics of who were bringing in and thinking about the lifetime value of card members right we are a business with extremely high retention rates relative to almost any other business you could think about and when we acquire customers we are thinking about the lifetime value of those customers thats one of the things that contributes to the excitement that steve started to call off when we think about the longerterm growth prospects of the demographic that we are increasingly bringing into the company operator well go to the line of mark devries with barclays go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hi mark mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc and this may be somewhat a related question to what rick just asked as i look at the kind of aspirational growth plan it looks like youre almost back to kind of a prefinancial crisis growth algorithm with a pretty healthy spread between revenue growth and eps growth as opposed to like the years prior to the pandemic where theres a much tighter spread is that a fair observation and if so whats different are you expecting more operating leverage is this higherreturn business youre bringing on kind of whats behind that jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well maybe ill start steve and so first mark i think id remind everyone our what we at the time referred to as our financial growth algorithm prepandemic which we very successfully executed on for straight quarters until the pandemic interrupted with ph total revenue growth in the to range and doubledigit eps growth so we have much bolder ambitions now to be in excess of on the revenue growth side and mid technical difficulty operator this is att weve lost your voice line if you could check your mute feature weve lost the host connection if you could please check your mute feature please ladies and gentlemen please stand by jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co ph i have lost the connection operator you are back on indiscernible jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co indiscernible stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co we are vivian y zhou a senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co yes american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co are we back alan operator yes you are connected stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co okay we have no idea why we lost the connection which is indiscernible i just started alan operator you had gotten into it a little bit im not sure exactly how far ph you went on stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co why dont you start again jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co okay sorry so apologies everyone not quite sure where the tech problem is were sitting in our office in the tower in new york so prepandemic we were at to revenue growth doubledigit eps growth like clockwork we executed on that for straight quarters until the pandemic interrupted we see ourselves having a much bolder aspiration now in excess of revenue growth midteens eps growth and thats going to come after a and at higher levels than that in terms of revenue growth and that kind of revenue growth gives us a tremendous platform for scale for relevance and for getting steady leverage on the marketing line and on the opex line because boy you dont need to grow marketing and opex and anywhere near those kind of rates so thats the math maybe you want to comment stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah no i would just say look weve been on you mentioned prefinancial crisis and yes prefinancial crisis there were years where we were in excess of revenue growth and then postfinancial crisis i mean the game changed postfinancial crisis not only from a competitive perspective but from a regulatory perspective and then we were more midsingle digits sort of revenue growth but the other thing id say is were a much larger company right now as well and so when you start to think about and you think about revenue growth youre looking at excess of billion per year in revenue growth so i think when you start to look at those numbers and put those in perspective and contrast those to pre and postfinancial crisis they are quite different but as i said we have all the faith in our strategy in a look in a highly competitive environment but if you think about whats moving us as i started this call with whats moving us right now to even higher revenue growth in the next two years is the fact that weve got some catchup to do with our core business in the areas that i mentioned in terms of te and in loan growth and in large and global and certainly in international and then as we move and get to a more steadystate thats where this again just this reliance of the strategy that weve implemented and as rick just mentioned and jeff answered the question in terms of the lifetime value and the focus on millennials and genz and whatever the next generation is going to be after this thats going to american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 be a key to our strategy as we expand the universe of card members from a premium perspective so youll see how it all plays out but we are very very confident operator our next question will come from lisa ellis with moffettnathanson lisa ellis q analyst moffettnathanson llc terrific thanks for squeezing me in i had a question about the investment plan supporting that outlook and beyond can you talk about the role of ma tuckin ma or i guess im thinking more broadly about adjacent areas that youre focused on investing in as you build towards that kind of two threeyear out plan im thinking about things like kabbage and resy like youve done in the past stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co lisa i think the way to think about this is look theres no singular investment target that we are looking at but i think youve hit the nail on the head we look at adjacencies that make sense and as we think about the strategies for the product i mean as we move into as we moved into a broader definition of how we were going to serve smes the kabbage platform made all the sense in the world look you had three choices there you could have tried to build it you could buy it or you could try and partner with it and so it was an opportune time and we were able to buy it and thats how were replatforming our sme base when you think about what weve done from a consumer perspective and resy is a good example of that is that its an extension of our overall indiscernible of the product and an investment in resy giving access to our card members to dining and its also a great acquisition tool for customers because resy is not an amex only product it has some amexonly offers for our customers so as we continue to build out the strategy we will make those determinations whether it makes sense for us to build it ourselves partner or buy it and well tuck those things in if and when they make sense and if the overall price is right so thats how well think about it but id just bring you back to the four strategic imperatives that we have which is continuing to be the best premium card provider for consumer looking at being that working capital provider for sme becoming even more digital to our customers and adding more and more merchants and as things make sense along that strategic continuum we will act if appropriate operator our next question will come from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning good to see stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hey don indiscernible american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc indiscernible i dont know can you guys hear me stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah ph we can hear you don donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great good to see the midteens growth and beyond i mean i think we all sort of think of lowdouble digits so good to see i guess steve could you dig in a little bit on this january and december omicron slowdown and maybe just talk about did you see a dip what kind of dip and has it stabilized just to give us some comfort on indiscernible stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah for us i think one of the the most leading the biggest leading indicator for us of whats going on is how people want to travel right because as we know people have shopped online we havent seen much of a slowdown from a goods and services perspective what really is the delineating factor is are people out and about and we talked about the fourth quarter as being up from a travel bookings perspective however the last few weeks of december we did see a slowdown in terms of some of our travel bookings as people got and rightfully so a little omicron nervous but the first two weeks in january our travel bookings were up over so what that tells me is people are ready to get out and get out and about again and well see when omicron peaks and when we get the next variant but i think society is learning how to deal with this and as ed bastian said on his earnings call i think well ultimately move from pandemic to endemic and well learn how to deal with this so we really havent seen a slowdown in our billings at all in fact weve seen an acceleration in travel bookings so that gives us a lot of confidence the other thing i would say though is that remember from a consumer perspective were back i mean from a te perspective we were up over from a consumer perspective in the fourth quarter and we anticipate that moving further north operator our final question will come from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hey sanjay american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc indiscernible aspirational guidance or longterm aspirational question again but if we think about sort of the longterm revenue algorithm right is there anything that youre seeing inside your customer base whether itd be higher unit economics on the new accounts or evolving mix shift from different businesses thats going to drive that aboveaverage revenue growth relative to history i guess it would be good and maybe this is an investor day thing it would be good to just understand sort of what the key drivers will be as we look out whether itd be the baseline for economic growth versus share shift versus the different segments right like b2b et cetera stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i dont know but thats an openended question but im just curious stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co no ive got it so sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc indiscernible stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co indiscernible youre helping us a little bit with our outline for investor day thank you but look i think one of the things that people dont take into account when they are thinking about future revenue growth is retention of card members one of the big drivers of our growth has been the fact that gee its a lot easier when you can keep on to your card members who are with you and who are spending and so forth and retention of card members is at an alltime high the other thing thats driving this is obviously the shift from a goods and services perspective i mean look we grew we had more billings in than we had in the history of the company and were at of our overall te billings in and theoretically were known as a te product right so i think well talk about this but i think there are a number of things i think its retention i think as jeff mentioned before in response to ricks question the lifetime value of card members obviously getting card members earlier in their life youre going to keep them longer especially if you have the retention rates that we have well continue from an sme perspective to evolve our product set and therefore evolve our revenues and well continue to bring loan balances back to we were above average industry growth from a loan balances perspective and we think well get back there so look well give you some more insight on that but i think those sort of from a highlevel perspective those are the things that give us all the confidence in the world vivian y zhou senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co american express co axp corrected
