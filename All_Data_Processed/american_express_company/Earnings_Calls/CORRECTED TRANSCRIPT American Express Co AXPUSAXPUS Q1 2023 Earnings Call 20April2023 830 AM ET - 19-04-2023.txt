back in january we laid out our guidance for of to revenue growth and doubledigit earnings per share growth our first quarter results are tracking to this fullyear guidance revenues were a record billion in the quarter up which is well above our fullyear expectations stronger spending growth outside the us and in te offset some softness in us small business spending eps came in a bit higher than our original plan expectation our plan calls for quarterly eps to grow sequentially through the year as our revenue growth continues though business was up globally yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis te spending was up quarteroverquarter on an fxadjusted basis due to grow over benefit from the impact of the omicron variant in last years results we saw strong demand across all te categories and customer types american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 spending at restaurants continues to be a bright spot with growth accelerating to on an fxadjusted basis yearoveryear in fact march was a record month for reservations booked through our resy platform the platform now has more than million users globally an increase of million in the last six months consumer travel demand also remains high with  bookings through our consumer travel business reaching their highest level since prepandemic as youll recall we reorganized our international business last year bringing together our consumer small business and large corporate management teams outside the us to increase agility scale and efficiency and accelerate our growth our international issuing businesses were the fastest growing before the pandemic and were seeing a return to those trends international card services billings continued to accelerate in the quarter up on fxadjusted basis results were driven by robust growth in te spending which increased yearoveryear on an fx adjusted basis we also saw continued momentum in card acquisitions with million new cards acquired in the quarter us consumer platinum and gold business platinum and delta cobrand account acquisitions all reached record levels notably over of the new accounts acquired globally in the quarter are on feebased products as weve noted for some time millennial and gen z consumers are driving our growth in billings and acquisitions of premium feebased products more than of consumer new accounts acquired globally came from millennial and gen z these customers also continue to contribute the highest growth in billed business among all age cohorts in the us up in the quarter on credit our metrics remain bestinclass supported by the premium nature of our customer base our strong risk management capabilities and the thoughtful underwriting actions weve taken on an ongoing basis our customers have been resilient thus far in the face of slower growth and higher inflation economic environment while the nearterm economic outlook is mixed our customers spending and credit performance to date along with the continued strong demand for our products from highquality new customers reinforces our confidence in our ability to achieve our longterm aspirations our capital funding and liquidity positions are strong and we continue to have significant flexibility to maintain a strong balance sheet in periods of uncertainty and stress as you know we run our company for the long term we have a strategy in place to deal with swings in the economy which has enabled us to be successful in navigating through the pandemic the initial recovery period and the current environment of elevated inflation and higher interest rates through it all weve continued to attract and retain highquality customers and our strategic investments have resulted in the momentum weve seen throughout last year and into we feel good about the decisions were making around growth risk management and the economic environment our key metrics are strong the market opportunities we see in our core businesses are plentiful and our strategy of investing in value proposition innovations customer acquisitions and global merchant coverage continues to drive our growth based on our performance to date we are reaffirming our full year guidance of delivering between and revenue growth and earnings per share of between and we remain committed to focusing on american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 achieving our aspiration of delivering sustainable revenue growth greater than and midteens eps growth as we get to a more steadystate macro environment thank you and now ill turn it over to jeff jeffrey c campbell vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well thanks steve and good morning everyone its good to be here to talk about our first quarter results which are tracking in line to the guidance we gave for the full year and reflect steady progress against our longterm growth aspirations starting with our summary financials on slide our first quarter revenues were billion reaching a record high for the fourth straight quarter up on an fxadjusted basis this revenue momentum drove reported net income of billion and earnings per share of given we had a sizeable credit reserve release of pandemicdriven reserves in the first quarter of last year weve also included pretax preprovision income as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter on this basis pretax preprovision income was billion up versus the same time period last year reflecting the growth momentum in our underlying earnings so now lets get into a more detailed look at our results which in our spendcentric business model always begins with a look at volumes which you see on slides through total network volumes and billed business were both up yearoveryear in the first quarter on an fx adjusted basis given that most of our spending categories have fully recovered versus prepandemic levels we saw the more stable growth rates we expected this quarter with first quarter billed business growth of just above last quarters growth of as steve noted earlier we did see particularly strong growth in travel and entertainment spending in  of driven by continued demand for travel and dining experiences as expected this growth rate was elevated early in the quarter as we lapped the impact of omicron in january of the prior year so i would expect to see growth moderate moving forward but to remain high given the strong demand we are seeing across geographies customer types and te categories we also saw solid growth in goods and services spending for the quarter up yearoveryear i would note that we did see this growth rate slow sequentially in the us for both sme and consumer as we went through the quarter so we are continuing to monitor these spending trends that said overall billed business reached a record level in the month of march and our largest segment us consumer grew billings in the first quarter accelerating a bit above last quarters growth millennial and gen z customers again drove our highest billed business growth within this segment with their spending growing yearoveryear this quarter turning to commercial services we saw yearoveryear growth of overall us sme growth came in at just this quarter but was somewhat offset by really good growth in us large and global corporates up year overyear american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 and lastly you see our highest growth in international card services we are seeing the early benefits of the organizational changes we announced last year start to play out demonstrated by strong growth across geographies and customer types spending from international consumer and international sme and large corporate customers who were among our fastest growing prepandemic grew and yearoveryear respectively international card services travel and entertainment growth was especially robust at for the quarter this segment is still in a recovery mode given it started its pandemic recovery later than other segments overall our spending volumes are currently tracking to support our revenue guidance for the year and our longterm aspirations for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were seeing prepandemic now moving on to loans and card member receivables on slide we saw yearoveryear growth of in our loan balances as well as continued sequential growth this growth continues to come mostly from our existing customers who are rebuilding balances and as a result the interestbearing portion of our loan balances is growing faster than the growth we see in total loans specifically over of this growth in the us is coming from our existing customers we are pleased with this growth and with the overall lending economics we are generating that said looking forward we may see the growth rate of our loan balances moderate a bit as we progress through but we would expect it to remain elevated versus prepandemic levels as you then turn to credit and provision on slides through the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our bestinclass credit performance our card member loans and receivables write off and delinquency rates remain below prepandemic levels though they did continue to move up this quarter as we expected which you can see on slide we view these consolidated writeoff and delinquency rates as more comparable to prepandemic rates than the individual loans and receivable rates because as we talked about last quarter our charge products in many instances now have embedded lending functionality going forward we continue to expect these delinquency and writeoff rates to increase over time but they are likely to remain below prepandemic levels in turning now to the accounting for this credit performance on slide the expected increases in delinquency rates combined with the quarteroverquarter growth in our loan balances resulted in a million reserve build this reserve build combined with net writeoffs drove billion of provision expense in the first quarter as we moved past much of the volatility in this line item that cecl reserve buildsreleases caused during the pandemic as you see on slide we ended the first quarter with billion of reserves representing of our total loans and card member receivables this reserve rate remained about basis points below the levels we had pre pandemic or day one cecl we expect this reserve rate to continue to increase as we move through but to remain below prepandemic levels moving next to revenue on slide total revenues were up yearoveryear in the first quarter or on an fxadjusted basis before i get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides i would note that service fees and other revenue was up in the quarter driven largely by the yearoveryear increases in travelrelated revenues that accompanied the tremendous demand weve seen for travel american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 as you can see on slide our largest revenue line discount revenue grew yearoveryear in  on an fx adjusted basis which similar to spending volumes growth is just above last quarters growth rate net card fee revenues were up yearoveryear in the first quarter on an fxadjusted basis as you can see on slide growth which did moderate slightly this quarter as expected from the extremely high level we saw last quarter remains quite strong this growth continued driven largely by bringing new accounts onto our feepaying products as a result of the investments weve made in our premium value propositions this quarter we acquired million new cards demonstrating the demand were seeing especially for our premium feebased products moving on to slide you can see that net interest income was up yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis accelerating versus last quarter primarily due to the growth in our revolving loan balances id also note that net yield on our card member loans increased basis points sequentially reaching pre pandemic levels this quarter as our customers increased their revolving balances we have been able to increase our net yield while maintaining net writeoff rates below prepandemic levels expanding our net credit margin to sum up on revenues on slide were tracking well against our expectations and looking forward we still expect to see revenue growth of to for the full year the revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments weve made those investments show up across the expense lines you see on slide starting with variable customer engagement expenses these costs came in at of total revenues in the first quarter tracking right with our expectations for them to run around of total revenues on a fullyear basis on the marketing line we invested billion in the quarter on track with our expectation to have marketing spend that is fairly flat to our full year expense billion we remain focused on driving efficiencies so that our marketing dollars grow far slower than revenue as we did for many years prior to the pandemic moving to the bottom of slide brings us to operating expenses which were billion in the first quarter theres usually some quarterly volatility in this number and this quarter for example we saw a million impact from net marktomarket losses on our amex ventures investment portfolio which you can see based off our first quarter results that similar to marketing we are tracking with our expectation for operating expenses to be around billion for the full year we continue to see operating expenses as a key source of leverage and moving forward expect to have far less growth in opex relative to our high level of revenue growth turning next to capital on slide we ended the first quarter with our cet1 ratio at within our target range of to i would note that aoci already flows through our regulatory capital today so any unrealized gains or losses on our investment portfolio are fully reflected in the that i just quoted id also point out that we hold only billion of investment securities most of which are shortdated us treasuries in the first quarter we returned million of capital to our shareholders with our strong capital position we have both the capacity and the intent to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth id also note that our liquidity position remains extremely strong as we ended the quarter with billion of cash our highest ever balance excluding the pandemic period we also saw a increase in our deposits this quarter including the inflows in the weeks following the recent volatility in the banking sector american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 on slide of the appendix we have provided a bit more detail on deposits than we typically do if youd like to look at some of the numbers that brings me then to our growth plan and guidance on slide for the full year we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth of to and earnings per share between and at this level yearoveryear revenue growth we expect to see a significant sequential increase in the amount of revenues as we go through the year in contrast our marketing and operating expenses were already more in line with the run rate for the year in the first quarter though theres always some quartertoquarter volatility so the simple math then gets you to the sequential growth in our underlying earnings consistent with our fullyear eps guidance there is clearly uncertainty as it relates to the macroeconomic environment but as steve discussed our customers have remained resilient thus far in the face of the slowergrowth higherinflation economic environment our outlook is based on the bluechip macroeconomic consensus which continues to expect slowing growth though not a significant recession in any environment though we are focused on running the company for the long term looking forward we remain committed to focusing on achieving our aspiration of sustainably delivering revenue growth in excess of and midteens eps growth as we get to a more steadystate environment with that ill turn the call back over to kerri to open up the call for your questions kerri s bernstein senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co thank you jeff and before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open the line for questions operator american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions one moment please for the first question our first question is coming from sanjay sakhrani of kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning steve i think the number thats pretty striking is the strong growth among millennials and gen z which seem like a third of the us spending volumes ive heard some worry about like this cohort because theyre relatively new to credit but obviously it seems like the spending remains quite strong so im just curious sort of how youre seeing things trend for them whether or not you feel like theres more risk or less risk and then maybe jeff you can elaborate a little bit more on the weaker spending trends that you saw in march thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah i think that well jeff can elaborate a little bit more but march was a record spending month for us overall it was the highest month we ever had in the history of the company so feel free to elaborate on that jeff but millennials have been a big part of our growth story and if you go back prepandemic represented about of our billings now they represent of our billings and theyre growing at i mean last quarter they grew at this quarter they grew at and were acquiring of our new cards acquired i think from a risk perspective they play out much like low tenure plays out and so we really have not seen anything different with millennials than we have seen with any of our other card acquisitions and so like anything you watch that but right now we dont have any concerns with that and the other thing that i will point out is that this whole concept of getting more millennials really started with our focus on generational relevance and making sure that our products and services were attractive across an entire cohort and so that is really working for us as you see in the composition of our base change and so that gives me a lot of confidence as we move forward that were making the right moves from a valueproposition perspective and continuing to invest in the right benefits and we are acquiring the right customers and as ive said on these calls before we continue to raise the bar in the face of an uncertain economic environment we continue to raise the bar on who were acquiring the last point that ill make because i think its really relevant and stay with me on this for a second if you go back to and look at all the cards that we acquired in and looked at what the first quarter spending was in and you did the same thing in and looked at what the first quarter spending was in we are higher meaning we are acquiring higherspending card members and so i think the teams have done a phenomenal job of really sort of getting through the clutter and getting not only more card members but getting card members that spend getting card members that are paying fees and getting card members that will be with us for a long time so its a long sort of answer but i think it really is relevant to what you were talking about in terms of millennials because i think that gives you a pretty good picture of just how we are looking at that segment and just how that segment is performing and how we believe it will continue to perform american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 so you want to talk about march jeff jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well the only thing i would add is were just trying to be transparent sanjay i think a lot of people describe the current economic environment as mixed and so march was our strongest month ever across the globe in terms of volumes as a company in the us spending on all customer types on travel and entertainment is really strong but you did see in goods and services as you went from january to february to march spending slow a little bit the growth rate sequentially on the other hand youve also got to sort through how does omicron last januaryfebruary fit into that so were just trying to be transparent about sorting through all the mixed signals but i think we come back to our customers overall have shown great resilience in the face of all the mixed signals in the economy and thats what we base running the company on operator thank you the next question is coming from mihir bhatia of bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi thank you for taking my question i was curious if you could elaborate a little bit more on the slowdown that youre seeing i think you mentioned in the us a little bit are there particular types of spending youre seeing is it broad based across customers and i think you mentioned both on the consumer and small business side so if you could just elaborate on that thanks and then if you have any data on april you can share stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well on the consumer side just look at sequentially consumer in the fourth quarter grew were growing so there was really no slowdown there when you look at us sme we grew were growing now so i think there was a little bit of a slowdown in us sme and remember when you look at our consumer business our consumer business i dont believe is really representative of the entire economy our consumer business is representative of a really highend premium consumer base our small business because of the volumes that we have are probably a little bit more representative and where you do see a slowdown in small business is goods and services what ill remind people is small businesses are small businesses because theyre small and what happens is audio gap to a level of spending and then unless that business is really going to grow you can only spend for what youre taking in but i think what weve seen and this is a continuing trend is youve seen a slowdown in a lot of the advertising spending but i will point out that thats not any different than what youve seen from a lot of corporations i mean and ours ourselves i mean if you look at it our plan has been to spend the same amount of marketing that we spent last year this year and that numbers billion and when you look at that number we try and get more and more efficient with that and we push our partners to become more and more efficient as well and so you get to a point of scale where you just dont spend anymore and i think were seeing a little of that in small business as well american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 but look growth in the us small business for the amount of volume that we have right now were okay with that and its in line with us making our overall plan what i would point out from a small business perspective is international is not like that international is growing much much faster than that and international is back to our fastestgrowing segment so well keep watching it but really happy with the consumer and right now i think small business is kind of in line with where we have it going for the rest of our plan for the rest of the year operator thank you the next question is coming from mark devries of barclays please go ahead mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks just wanted to get into what drove the acceleration of growth in international card services jeff i heard you allude to the fact of seeing results from the reorg but could you talk a little bit more specifically about kind of what you did in that business segment to really drive the improvement stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well i think so its a couple things right number one no place in the world was more impacted by the pandemic than international and when you look at our card base internationally it is a really high teorientated card base and correct me if im wrong i think this is it jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co yeah stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co te increase in our international part so thats number one i mean i think you have just some builtup demand that had been pushed down number one number two we continued to improve our merchant coverage tremendously in international so there are more and more places to use the card and i think coverage cannot be understated or overlooked in how it drives growth especially in international and i think thats really important i think we continue to acquire new card members in international as well and as far as the reorganization what the reorganization does for us is makes us a lot more efficient and so let me give you an example sometimes its really hard to determine whether a potential customer is a small business or whether a potential customer is a consumer and what you do is you put resources and you go against you attack them both ways well now what were doing is were looking at that in a more holistic way and so instead of having what i like to refer to as noahs ark syndrome of two of everything we now have someone in a market focused on card acquisition both small business consumer and international and large market and corporate as well and so i think what weve done is weve been able to become more efficient with our marketing weve been able to share intellectual property across business lines and weve been able to in a given market make better trade off decisions from an investment perspective because were running it much more as a market as opposed to american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 running it as global segments and i think thats really given the team lot more flexibility and given them a lot more ability to achieve their goals and look the reality is international was the fastest growing part of our business prepandemic and these moves were made to become more efficient to get it back to where it was and go beyond that and so we feel good about the start that internationals on at the moment jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co and the only comment id add mark is it is remarkable the breadth of the strength right now when you look across geographies its europe its uk its where we are in latin america its asia its really broad based so we feel really good about the progress operator thank you the next question is coming from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to hi stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co betsy hi betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i did want to just ask a overarching question on top line growth drivers from here and i know we have already spoken about a couple of different line items i think us and large corporate is still something we could unpack a little bit but i would also like if you could just from your vantage point give us where you think the growth drivers are from here which extremely strong thanks jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well in many senses betsy i would almost just point you to the first quarter results because i think one of the drivers of our confidence is the breadth of strength we see across all the lines of the pl so discount revenues when you look forward and look at growth are going to look about like they did this quarter i think youll see it tail down slightly because you have a little bit of an omicron tailwind maybe in january and february but volumes look good and thats going to continue to be a nice doubledigit driver of growth american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 we have grown net card fees in double digits consistently for years right through every single quarter of the pandemic and theyve been above for the last couple of quarters thats going to continue because what we constantly have to remind people of is its not particularly increases in fees for any given card that drive that although it helps its mostly the steady acquisition that steve talked about of more people on our higherfee paying cards net interest income as i said i think our overall loan balance growth will probably continue to be higher than it was prepandemic but moderate a bit as our customers kind of get through the process of rebuilding balances i think i dont want to pretend to suggest i can predict exactly what interest rates do the rest of the year thatll have some impact on the growth rate although i remind you unlike most banks the impact of rates moving one way or another on us is very very modest were reasonably hedged theres a 10k disclosure about that for anyone whos interested but were not that heavily impacted and then you have the service fee and other revenue line which is benefiting from travelrelated strength and i think that will continue so i think as you think about the drivers of revenue growth across the rest of the year it doesnt look that different than what you saw in the first quarter its very broad based and thats what gives us confidence stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so i could just say what he said but let me just take it up a level and i think that one of the things that we do in looking for opportunities is we try and make sure were investing in those opportunities which have the greatest return and jeff said this many many times on these calls we have more good opportunities to invest in than we have dollars to invest and i think nothing is a better example of how good our opportunities how much better our opportunities have become in how i answered the first question for sanjay in talking about how the cards that were acquiring now are in this first quarter anyway better than they were back in and the other thing that i would say which i think is really important is when we look at acquiring a customer and we report cards but we look at acquiring revenue and when we look at a customer revenue for us is a three legged stool we acquire card members and a majority of the cards were acquiring right now are paying fees thats a huge differentiator for us then what we do you pay that fee you use the product and then as jeff said that discount revenue and that discount revenue is going to grow pretty much in line with where it was now and then the third leg of this stool is interest income and weve modified our product so that we have plan it on it we have pay over time and so were giving our customers lots and lots of choices in how they want to manage their financial lives with us and then how they want to manage their credit card payments and so we really focus a lot on revenue for our customers and thats what gives us a lot of confidence because when we acquire a customer its not okay were going to acquire and were going to drive lending revenue were going to acquire this customer and its going to be fee we literally look at that entire basket and as we look at the rois all of that is taken into account operator thank you the next question is coming from rick shane of jpmorgan please go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks guys for taking my question this morning id like to discuss the accounting and strategy on fee waivers when fees are waived im assuming that the fees are recognized and theres an offsetting expense in terms of marketing are both the fees and expenses accreted and amortized quarterly is that the way we should think about it jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well i think can i maybe step back rick because in many ways i think sometimes theres a misnomer about when we have a line called marketing whats actually in the marketing line right so there are a variety of incentives that we offer to customers and sometimes to partners to help us acquire customers that are involved in bringing new card members into the franchise and when you look at the billion that we spend in marketing theres a very small portion of that that is ads that probably people talk about more but the overwhelming majority of whats in that sic billion are the costs of the many kinds of incentives that we offer to customers and so fee waivers can be an incentive or interest rates on balances that are at promotional levels but in general the cost of those welcome incentives are going to be amortized over varying periods right we offer lots of different kinds of marketing incentives so i cant generalize to the exact period but generally theyre going to be amortized over a period so one of the things we always wrestle with is when you look at it in total as youre bringing more customers into the franchise you generally are recognizing the cost of bringing them in more quickly than theyre spending and their revenues ramp up and so like many companies you sometimes have the good problem that the more you bring new customers in which is a good thing for the long term in the short run that can create a little bit of a economic headwind so thats the way i would think about this operator thank you the next question is coming from craig maurer of ft partners please go ahead craig maurer q analyst ft partners hey good morning thanks for taking the question jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co good morning carig hey welcome back craig maurer q analyst ft partners thanks its been fun getting the business up and running for ft partners and again i appreciate you taking the question so thinking about credit if we look at what drove the provisioning expense in the quarter it looks like the allowance build was actually materially less than it was in fourth quarter despite the relatively similar provision amount so it seems like you were soaking up the losses that were driven by the rise in delinquencies in the back half of last year but you only saw a very small increase in delinquencies in the quarter so i guess the question american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 is are you comfortable with where allowance levels are now especially considering theyre materially higher than where they were going into the pandemic jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well let me can i work backwards i think the simple way because this is such a complex subject as you know craig that i always encourage people to think about this is take the reserves on the balance sheet divide it by the total loans and receivables that ratio is at the end of this quarter compare that number to what was day one cecl it was you can compare that same number to every other financial institution that reports and i think thats a simple way to both track us versus history and us versus other companies and as you know our is by a long shot best in class relative to what others have when you think about sequential cecl accounting what i would say is the fourth quarter of last year was probably one of the last quarters thats still what i will refer to as pandemic cecl noise in other words all of the financial institutions built all these big reserves released them at different times for us and i think this is different from any other institutions were kind of past that and so what you see starting in the first quarter not in the fourth quarter of last year is really not influenced by all the noise that the pandemic drove as we all built and then released reserves its why in some ways i think going forward from here youre back to i dont know if theres such a thing as a bau view of cecl accounting because none of us have done cecl accounting in a normal world but for us were sort of back at a fairly steadystate run rate so if you think about it we expect loan balances to continue to build we expect credit metrics to continue to moderate up a little bit and thatll cause us to continue to build a little bit of reserve each quarter and all of that is built into the guidance that were affirming today operator thank you the next question is coming from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer please go ahead dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc hey guys good morning jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co good morning dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc thank you so much for taking my questions so i know a lot of the business obviously depends on the consumer but you do have a very large unique commercial business and so if you think about the big tightening some believe will occur how do you think this plays out through your large and smb businesses as access to credit changes and how do you think those dominoes kind of fall and affecting their spending levels or whatever you think are the key elements there thatd be great to hear your perspective thanks so much stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 well i think lets look at how much it represents right large and global accounts represent about of our overall spending and im not so sure when you look at that segment that sort of credit tightening is really going to drive their spending that is predominantly a te game and most companies are trying to get their people out and trying to get them to go out and travel and that spending has been up were still not back to where we were what normally affects that for us is more layoffs and things like that but even in the face of layoffs especially in the tech segment or late starts that are going to occur in consulting and things like that i think were in a unique situation right now where i just dont think credit tightening in that segment is really going to be an issue i think there its going to be more of an earnings story and do they do layoffs but again were in such a crazy spot where most people arent traveling anyway and people are encouraging to travel i dont see that i think when you look at small businesses small businesses go in and out quite a bit and you could see with some credit tightening some small businesses having harder access to some working capital what i would say is one of the things that we do have from a small business perspective is we are really with our launch of blueprint and kabbage and so forth we have working capital loans we have shortterm loans and so forth and were not in the same position as a lot of these other smaller banks are and so for those creditworthy small businesses we will continue to extend credit and it could be an opportunity for us actually provided the credit is good so i think in general it can affect the small business economy and their ability maybe to grow to get working capital but i think it also provides us with an opportunity because we may not be the lender of first resort to these small businesses right now and i think it could be an opportunity for us again judiciously but an opportunity operator thank you the next question is coming from moshe orenbuch of credit suisse please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks jeff you had talked a little bit about the opex being kind of flattish over the course of the year i think i mean historically that had kind of been seasonally low in the beginning of the year and seasonally high at the end is there something thats changed with respect to that jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co yeah i think look every year is a little different and you have a higher growth rate yearoveryear moshe this quarter because if you think about we really were in a rampup as were many companies as we came out of the pandemic as we all dealt with what was some pretty high attrition in late and and we were sort of fully ramped to where we needed to be the way we think about opex and this is actually the way we talk about it internally as well is we have a lot of confidence in the very high revenue growth rates that we have set out in our guidance to this year we built the infrastructure of this company through the end of last year to manage that level of volume of revenue so we are where we need to be to manage that which is why wed expect sequentially this year to find that opex pretty flat so we provided guidance for opex of about billion if you take out the million marktomarket loss we had on our ventures portfolio which was mainly driven by one company were pretty much tracking right to that and i think our record i would suggest over more than a decade is when we tell you were going to hit a certain american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 opex number or control opex i think we have a pretty good track record doing that so thats how i would think about it operator thank you the next question is coming from bob napoli of william blair please go ahead robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and good morning jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co good morning bob robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc question just on big picture if you will from if you look at the big tech companies like amazon and apple and their involvement in financial services getting a little bit more and i know that in some ways theyre partners but what are your thoughts around the competitive risk from the large tech companies they seem to be getting more and more involved in credit cards and other financial service types that might be competitive stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well look theyve been involved for a decade and obviously we partner with amazon we work very very closely with apple on apple pay and obviously theyre a large merchant and a large partner and its not just apple and amazon we look at we look at all the fintechs and the startups and what have you and thats why we always say when you look at competition its just not the traditional banks its the fintech its the big tech players and so forth and the reality is the way that you have to compete not only against them but compete against everybody else is you have to give your customers what they want and you have to continually to develop better value propositions and so yeah these are great companies there are great banks out there amazon and apple are phenomenal companies that know the consumer we believe we know the consumer as well and they help us raise our game overall but were not naïve enough to think that we can just go on sort of strolling down the street here thinking nobodys ever going to compete and no ones going to come after us the way were paranoid we think everybodys coming after us and its one of the reasons that we constantly focus on upgrading our products and services and its one of the things that we talk about were constantly adding value to our products yeah it would be probably easier to not do that but we challenge the team constantly to develop better value propositions and so we worry about everybody and the only thing that we can do about it is continue to do what weve done for years offer the best service offer the best products and make sure that our customers are happy operator thank you the next question is coming from don fandetti of wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 good morning jeff jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co good morning don donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc i was wondering if you could talk about the bank hi the banking crisis do you expect that to impact your ability to buy back stock and also was there any impact from the delta sharing adjustment and will there be any this year jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co so two very different questions so capital and liquidity don i mean we are in a very strong position our capital target of to on a cet1 basis is actually well above the regulatory requirement our target is really driven by the rating agency view so none of us know exactly whats going to happen from the regulatory perspective but even some change in the regulatory environment could significantly increase the capital we need to hold it is unlikely to have any impact on what we actually hold today and so look our company has roe of or better we generate a tremendous amount of capital we dont need that much capital to support our organic growth so youll see us continue to aggressively buy back shares which is why i think the board in fact approved a huge new multiyear target for share repurchase earlier in the quarter our liquidity position is also very strong as i talked about in our remarks when you think about headwinds in id remind you on the january call i pointed out that a 500basispoint increase in interest rates in a year is a headwind for us yearoveryear in which wont really exist in ph though unlikely do another basis points and for that matter i just talked in response to craigs question about the fact that our provision this year is kind of back to a steadystate level whereas last year you had it still greatly impacted by cecl reserve releases so those are two headwinds in we will not have in you have put your finger on the third headwind which is we have a fabulous partnership with delta works great for them works great for us we work together all the time you seem to see steve and ed together like every week practically but it is true that when we renewed early the partnership back in and extended it through we agreed to a change in the rates of how some of the economic sharing worked effective the year the original contract was going to expire which was so there is a stepup this year that flows through various lines in the pl but generally falls into the variable customer engagement line so thats part of what drove us up a little bit on the to target that we have this year i would point out thats another sort of headwind to our earnings growth this year that we will not face in so thank you for the question operator thank you our final question will come from lisa ellis with moffettnathanson please go ahead lisa ellis q analyst moffettnathanson llc american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 terrific thanks for taking my question i had just a question on te renormalization with te up again yearonyear its still clearly renormalizing a bit post pandemic as you highlighted particularly outside the us do you have a sense like looking under the covers at the spending dynamics how much further that has to go and when we might see that piece thats been driving some of your disproportionate growth moderate a little bit i think some folks might have been expecting that to start happening already at the beginning of this year but clearly its not happening so im wondering how much more weve got to go on that thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co i think you still have quite a bit to go on te and especially as corporations start to bring back their te spending as well and te spending is up in every single segment that we have i mean we talked about total te up the consumers up commercials up it keeps growing and we talked about international up so we still think we have more room to grow and i talked about bookings with airlines and airlines will also expand their capacity and as they expand their capacity well continue to grow with them so i think theres still more upside in airlines and when theres more upside in airlines it becomes more upside in lodging and people have just gotten used to eating out and the restaurant spending is if you ask me about anything that surprises me it would be restaurant spending continuing to be as strong as it is but i think for us a lot of that has to do with resy and the fact that we are able to probably even get a larger share of our card members restaurant spending as they book their reservations through resy and the other thing id point about resy resys been a really nice addition to our acquisition of new cardholders who have a propensity to want to eat at restaurants and te so i think youre still going to see very strong te throughout this year itll certainly outpace our goods and services and were getting back were continuing to climb back if you remember prepandemic we were around in terms of our spending goods and services and te and there really is no reason that should not go back to the way it was so we think we just have upside in te
