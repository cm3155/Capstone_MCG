all i hope you and your families are healthy and staying safe as we go through this covid19 crisis as we said on our investor call on march were in unprecedented times our results in january and february continued the strong trends weve seen over the past quarters but were now operating in a very different world the deterioration in the economy due to covid19 impacts that began during the first quarter and accelerated in april has dramatically impacted our volumes looking ahead its impossible to know when the economy will improve in the meantime were focused on supporting our colleagues and customers while remaining financially strong so that we can be in a position to grow when the crisis ends jeff will take you through some detail on how this environment is impacting various components of our financial results my comments will focus on what were doing to manage the company through the near term so that we can be in a position to take advantage of the growth opportunities that will be available when the economy improves american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 last year as many economists were predicting an economic slowdown at some point we put together a plan for managing through a range of potential economic scenarios and we modeled what our response might look like in those scenarios of course the economic situation were facing right now is nothing like those we modeled however we developed a framework that were using to guide us in managing the company through the short term as we plan for the future our framework for managing through this cycle is built on four principles you will see on slide supporting our colleagues and winning as a team protecting our customers and our brand structuring the company for growth in the future and remaining financially strong ill spend a few minutes talking about each of these principles which represent our priorities for turning to slide from day one of this crisis our priority has been to take care of our people the american express colleagues around the world we wanted to ensure our colleagues felt secure in their jobs which is why we committed to no covid19related layoffs for the remainder of in addition were continuing to pay the salaries of colleagues who are affected by the virus without having to use their paid leave we also committed to paying all outofpocket covidrelated medical expenses for colleagues in our us medical plans as the virus spread rapidly around the world we wanted to keep our colleagues safe and secure so we moved quickly to a fulltime workfromhome arrangement in all our locations including thousands of our frontline service colleagues a core value of our company from our earliest days has been supporting the communities from where we do business and where our colleagues live and work when the covid19 pandemic hit we committed over million in grants of the american express foundation to a number of charitable organizations around the world that are supporting frontline workers in this crisis we also pledged to match more than million in card member donations to feeding america when us card members use their membership rewards points to donate through to the organization through justgivingcom in addition were working with our partners to support our communities for example were partnering with hilton to donate up to million hotel room nights to frontline medical professionals across the us and were backing marriotts rooms for responders initiative to provide a ph home base for healthcare professionals in some of the hardest hit regions the next principle is protecting our customers and our brand our global customer base is one of our most important assets and like everyone theyre going through a difficult time right now were offering a range of financial assistance options to help our customers weather the storm adding new product benefits to be relevant in todays environment and continuing to provide the worldclass customer service our customers expect and rely on our consumer and small business card members are taking advantage of the various shortterm financial assistance options we offer to help them navigate through this period including temporary payment deferrals interest and late fee waivers and protections from collection calls and negative credit bureau reporting we also offer a range of longerterm assistance programs for certain customers who require more time were expanding eligibility for these programs and enhancing them to provide for additional payment flexibility based on customer circumstances american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 to enable our us small business customers to obtain the financial assistance provided under the sbas paycheck protection program weve been authorized as an sba ppp lender and began to accept applications from our customers earlier this week which we will submit to the sba as soon as that window opens in addition to our financial assistance initiatives weve enhanced our membership rewards programs and were adding new offers benefits and rewards to our premium products that are particularly relevant for the times were in now for example since people are not currently traveling eating out or shopping in store weve adjusted our mr programs to include discounts at amazon when you pay with points and the ability to earn double points with orders from grubhub and seamless through the end of the year were also adding a range of limited time offers credits and rewards on stayathome services such as wireless streaming grocery and food delivery for our consumer and certain cobrand card customers as well as business essentials like wireless office equipment and shipping for our small business customers for our cobrand customers were also working with our partners to extend card member benefits such as airline companion certificates and hotel free night awards so our mutual customers will have more time to enjoy these benefits and for our travel customers were waiving fees for any flight changes or new bookings made through american express travel now through may in addition to our card members were supporting small businesses as we have for many years through shop small initiatives like small business saturday and many others around the world during the covid19 crisis were continuing to promote the positive impact consumers can have on their local communities and small businesses through our stayhome and shopsmall campaign earlier this week we launched stand for small in the us a coalition of more than companies across various industries that have come together to back small businesses by providing a wide range of offers complementary services access to corporate assistance programs and other resources designed to help support them as they manage through the crisis we look forward to many more companies joining this initiative over the coming weeks for our merchant partners were also temporarily extending the amount of time businesses must respond to disputes and have increased contactless transaction thresholds to reduce physical contact at the point of sale in countries finally our customer care professionals made a quick transition from a brickandmortar operation to a home based servicing one and we did so with minimal disruption in fact our servicing levels quickly came back to bau levels and our customer satisfaction results improved during the crisis and are at significantly higher levels now than in january our next principle is structuring the company for future growth while we believe that the covid19 pandemic will generate certain changes in our business in the near term and likely over the long term it will also generate opportunities and we intend to be in a position to take advantage of the opportunities as they present themselves were starting with a strong foundation the assets we have our differentiated business model particularly our brands our customers and our merchant network give us a great base to build upon in addition the strategic imperatives weve been focused on over the past few years remain just as relevant today and while well make some adjustments considering the current environment well continue to pursue our overall strategies in the american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 following areas expanding our leadership in the premium consumer space building on our strong position in commercial payments strengthening our global integrated network to provide unique value and making american express an essential part of our customers digital lives as the crisis unfolded we knew that we had to reprioritize our investments in each of these areas to focus on those initiatives that are critical to retaining our premium customer base and strengthening our merchant network while at the same time continuing to invest in those areas that are key to our longterm growth strategy this led us to a thorough and thoughtful process to identify activities that we should stop slow accelerate and continue what were stopping for the time being includes items that are less critical in todays environment including traditional advertising marketing sponsorships and customer acquisition activities were slowing down the development and launch of some of the new products we had in the pipeline for this year were accelerating investments in mobile servicing and credit and collections capabilities that are not only important today but are also important for our continued growth over the longer term and were continuing our activities in a number of areas including acquiring new merchants globally our ongoing efforts to launch our new network in china our network replatforming initiative our premium product refresh strategy in both consumer and commercial and continuing to integrate and develop new digital capabilities as well as making longerterm enhancements in our servicing platform and other key areas that are important for our future success finally we entered this crisis with particularly strong capital and liquidity positions that will enable us to remain financially strong while some of our expense categories such as rewards costs and the cost of card member services will decline automatically as spending declines and customer behaviors change were taking aggressive actions to reduce discretionary expenses across the enterprise by nearly billion from our original plan in the areas i mentioned before and we are redirecting some of those funds into new product benefits and longerterm investments i described a few moments ago looking ahead in the near term our earnings will be driven by the answers to two questions that no one yet can answer first when and how strongly does spending rebound as the global economy recovers second how long do the challenges of high unemployment levels and small business shutdowns last perhaps softened by the record levels of government support and what does that mean for our credit losses until we all get to the answers to these questions were reducing our spending in every area that doesnt make sense in the current environment consistent with our intention to not have any covid19related layoffs in and consistent with our intention of protecting our customers and the brand so those are our principles weve established for managing through this period in a way that will position us to return to growth when the economy rebounds without a doubt these are times that are unlike any that ive encountered in my years at american express but while the magnitude and uncertainty of todays challenges are more intense the lessons weve learned through other crises will serve us well as we work through this one as always well remain focused on what we can control in the short term while keeping an eye on the long term and like before we intend to come back stronger our teams are working day and night all over the world to help our card members and our merchants just as we have done throughout our history and when this is over we intend to be in a position of strength ready to capitalize on the opportunities ahead because weve managed these shortterm challenges while remaining focused on growth over the longer term american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 thank you for your time and now ill turn it over to jeff jeffrey c campbell executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co thank you steve and good morning everyone today ill take you through our results with more realtime granularity on recent trends than i normally do to help you understand how our business is performing in this rapidly evolving environment starting with our summary financials id encourage you to look at slides and together as you can see on slide while january and february were strong months march was a very different month and so the full quarter results are not so helpful for understanding our performance in the current environment as you recall when we held our investor update on march we said we expected first quarter earnings per share excluding credit reserves would be between and and thats where weve landed we also said we expected fxadjusted revenue growth would be in the to range but we came in a bit below that due to spending trends at the end of march deteriorating even faster than we had expected as well as some of our ancillary revenue lines coming in a bit lower than expected turning now to the details of our performance ill start with billed business clearly it is remarkable how much the world has changed in just the last monthandahalf whats most important as you think about the nearterm future is understanding whats happening today and so weve included a different view of our billed business than our typical quarterly disclosures which you can still find in the appendix on slides to instead on slides and we have shown you our weekly proprietary billed business growth trends through the latest date for which our data is complete which is april looking at all this data there are four key observations id make first the volume declines accelerated dramatically in march whereas january and february results were still in line with our performance over the last few years second te which was roughly of our proprietary volumes in is down almost third nonte spending has declined more modestly as youd expect some areas such as grocery spending and some online commerce have held up quite well and even accelerated whereas other categories such as other categories of more traditional retail have been much weaker and fourth you will see that our proprietary billings decline seemed to have stabilized somewhat in april with overall proprietary volume growth down around turning next to loan performance on slide total loans declined by yearoveryear in the first quarter driven primarily by lower spending in todays environment where there are so many questions around credit we felt it would be helpful to remind you about the composition of our loan book at the end of the first quarter of our outstanding loan balances were with us consumers were with international consumers and the remaining were with small businesses almost all of which are in the us moving on to slide we wanted to spend a minute focusing on our charge receivables because in an environment where spending volumes move dramatically these balances move dramatically as well as you can see in the chart on the left with only one month of spend declines our charge receivables are down versus the prior year and billion below the prior quarter this dynamic is important as you think about liquidity and capital in this environment which i will get to later in my remarks american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 of course our charge receivables also have a different risk profile than our lending book and even within our charge receivables book there are different types of credit exposure and so weve included a breakout of where these charge receivables come from on the righthand side of the slide around of our charge receivables are from consumer charge card members and another are from small business charge card members the remaining is from corporate cards which have relatively lower risk exposure slide then shows our traditional credit metrics for our lending and charge portfolios the trends in both write offs and delinquencies in the first quarter were solid and remained bestinclass in part due to all of our risk management efforts over the past few years to prepare for an eventual downturn you do see a modest increase in writeoff and delinquency rates yearoveryear and sequentially primarily due to lower loan and receivable balances as opposed to any significant change in credit performance further were you to look at our tdr disclosures in our  10q those balances are also relatively in line with the prior quarter now obviously our traditional credit metrics all look fine because not enough time has passed for things to show up in these traditional metrics what we are all trying to manage going forward is the collision of record levels of unemployment combined with record levels of government support so turning to slide you will see the total balances that are enroled in our customer pandemic relief program which we established to support our customers that have encountered hardship due to covid19 since we created this program in march weve had nearly accounts enrol in the program globally through mid april just a few days ago id also note that over of the us consumer and small business loan and receivable balances enroled in this program are from prime and super prime card members and many of those card members have made some payments since enrolment in addition weve seen the pace of new enrolments slow a bit from its peak a few weeks ago we are working hard alongside these customers to get to the best outcome for both our customers and our shareholders by providing payment deferrals waiving interest and certain fees as well as protecting them from adverse bureau reporting and collections actions we are also working as people roll off these shortterm programs to develop new longerterm solutions as well as leveraging our preexisting hardship programs to help them retain their membership and to get to a good financial outcome so one of the many uncertainties around the economic future is the outcome of those efforts which will be one of the factors that influences our credit performance through this crisis so lets move on to provision on slide the first point i would make is that just as our credit metrics were relatively unchanged in the first quarter our writeoff dollars were also in line with our original expectations and do not yet reflect the incremental stress from the current crisis the growth in provision expense is all about the billion credit reserve build and the credit reserve build is all about the macroeconomic outlook as we close the books in early april which was suddenly and significantly much more pessimistic than when we started the year this outlook does attempt to incorporate all the uncertainties around the impacts of covid19 as well as any potential offsets from the unprecedented level of government stimulus american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 so turning then to slide you see that our reserves at the end of the first quarter are almost double the reserve levels we had on our balance sheet at the end of last year the increase is from a combination of the billion of reserves we built when we implemented the current expected credit loss accounting methodology cecl on january as well as the billion of credit reserves we added at the end of the first quarter as a result of the worsening macroeconomic outlook due to covid19 today our lending and charge credit reserves on the balance sheet represent of our loan balances and of our charge receivable balances respectively so the key underpinning of these reserves are the macroeconomic assumptions that informed the billion credit reserve build we took in the first quarter which we show you on slide as you know we do not have an inhouse economist and so we use an external provider and look at a range of macroeconomic forecasts that we weight together in our credit reserve models when we closed the books on the first quarter those scenarios assumed that gdp would be down to and the unemployment rate would rise to to in the second quarter with a steady modest recovery after that its important to note that the latest macroeconomic outlook today reflects an even more significant deterioration in us gdp and unemployment than when we closed the books on the first quarter if those forecasts were to hold or even worsen by the time we close the books on the second quarter we would expect to have another large reserve build so this gives you a clear view of the assumptions behind our  reserve build but only time will tell what the ultimate level of writeoffs will be given the completely unprecedented nature of the global environment turning next to revenue on slide net card fees remained our fastestgrowing revenue line with growth in the first quarter we expect this revenue line to decelerate less in the short term relative to other revenue lines based on our historical experience with strong card fee performance in a downturn as well as the fact that we have roughly billion of deferred card fee revenue already sitting on the balance sheet today however its also important to note that the majority of the card fee growth weve seen over the past few years has been driven by growth in our feebased portfolios with around of our new card acquisitions in on feebased products as the pace of new account growth slows in this environment we would expect to see a modest slowdown in net card fee growth over time net interest income growth of was faster than the average loan growth we saw in the first quarter driven by a modest tailwind from interest rate reductions yearoveryear as well as continued yield benefits from mix and pricing for risk the details around average ar and yield trends can be found in the appendix on slide in addition as i mentioned earlier in my remarks we saw softness in some ancillary revenue lines particularly from travelrelated revenue streams that are relatively immaterial and typically dont change much quarterto quarter but were down significantly yearoveryear in the first quarter turning then to the largest component of our revenue discount revenue id move you ahead to slide as you can see on the right discount revenue declined for the full quarter and in the month of march the contraction in discount revenue was larger than the decline in billed business american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 on average we earn higher discount revenues from our te merchants than we do from our nonte merchants so given the much larger declines we are seeing in te spend the divergence in te and nonte billing trends drove a 3basispoint decline in the average discount rate in the first quarter and a 10basispoint decline in the average discount rate in march relative to the prior year looking forward if the spending trends we see in early april persist with te spending down about for the entirety of the second quarter our discount rate erosion in the second quarter could be as much as to basis points now lets talk about our expenses when you think about our cost structure youve got the costs that come down naturally as spend declines and certain behaviors change and when you look at the three customer engagement expense lines shown on slide you see this dynamic in the sequential change in growth between and the first quarter of one way you might think about this dynamic in the current environment is that as our revenue goes down in the near term you could see about a offset to the revenue movement in these lines other expenses such as marketing and opex move based on management decisions as steve discussed in light of the current environment were aggressively reducing costs across the enterprise in fact were cutting discretionary expenses through the end of the year by billion relative to our original plans were also choosing to selectively reinvest some of these savings in initiatives that are key to our longterm growth strategy looking at slide you see that the environment in march changed too quickly for us to see a significant impact from these decisions in our first quarter marketing and operating expenses so let me explain how we expect those cost reductions to impact these lines from a yearoveryear standpoint going forward in the balance of the year wed expect to dramatically reduce our proactive marketing efforts and reinvest in the additional product benefits that steve spoke about in his opening remarks while reducing many other costs as a result i would expect our operating expenses to be down about billion yearoveryear cumulatively over the next three quarters on the marketing line we are funding the additional product benefit adjustments that steve discussed with our other marketing cuts the net of the two should result in a modest reduction in marketing investment levels relative to last year moving last to capital on slide as steve mentioned earlier we are entering the current crisis with a strong capital position our cet1 ratio was at the end of the first quarter above our to cet1 target range the sequential growth in our cet1 ratio was driven by the countercyclical nature of our balance sheet as our balance sheet shrinks with declining ar and loan balances in the current environment our riskweighted assets drop accordingly i would also note that our first quarter cet1 ratio includes a roughly 80basispoint impact from the fiveyear transition option made available under the fed rule to delay any capital effects of cecl until weve repurchased billion worth million worth of shares in the first quarter but have suspended our share repurchase program as of midmarch and we do not expect to resume share repurchases for the time being given the current environment however with our strong capital position we have the capacity and intend to continue to pay our dividend in the second quarter american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 turning to slide the countercyclical nature of our business is also reflected in our particularly strong liquidity position during the first quarter our cash and investments balance increased from billion to billion in  driven mainly by the decline in ar and loans we also saw strong demand for personal savings deposits during the first quarter even as we adjusted pricing given the current rate environment our personal savings deposit base is up versus the prior quarter and up yearoveryear putting it all together our capital funding and liquidity positions are strong and we have significant flexibility to maintain a strong balance sheet in periods of uncertainty or stress in summary we are certainly in unprecedented times and looking ahead its impossible to forecast our financial results for the rest of the year without knowing the answer to the two questions steve posed earlier when and how quickly the economy improves and what happens to unemployment and the pace of small business recovery until then were focused on supporting our colleagues and customers prudently managing our risk exposure and expense base and ensuring that our capital and liquidity levels stay strong so that we can take advantage of the inevitable rebound for our customers colleagues and shareholders with that ill turn the call back over to vivian vivian y zhou senior vice president head of investor relations american express credit corp thank you jeff before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions operator question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw go ahead please sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning and i hope you guys are well i wanted to follow up on the cost reduction commentary and im curious steve and jeff you mentioned these are unprecedented times and a lot of the situation is fluid i mean if things continue to remain as depressed as they are or even get worse how much more can you cut on costs because it seems like youre selectively still making some investments here is there a room to take down costs further than youve outlined and just on a related note as we think about your card product orientation being travel and entertainmentdriven i mean do you see people sort of shifting away to other cards as a result and are there any proactive strategies that you can employ as a result thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co okay so let me this is a very slick way of asking two questions but let me answer the second one first i think whats important to understand with our card base is that of our spending is on nonte and while you look american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 at the benefits that we do have on our card base what our card members really appreciate is experiences of all type great service and our brand and what youll see coming out in early may is actual product refreshes to a number of our products which will infuse additional value in addition to the value that a card may have so if you look at our platinum card where you have fine hotels and resorts and you have uber credits and you have other travel benefits and lounges and so forth you will see other enhancements there from wireless to streaming to maybe some other types of travel credits which can be used in the future over a time period but i think what youll also see in the short term is card members using that and using the points in the longer term i think heres where our product refresh strategy really does help us because we will continue to modify products as the environment continues to change and morph and so we think some of the benefits that card members use will come back over time so i dont think we will see people switch products and just a comment on the cobrand product of our cobrand spend is off the cobrand partner so if you think about delta you think about marriott you think about hilton its less than of that spending is actually at those properties for those particular things and so what i would say is we will continue to evaluate well continue to monitor but you will see value injection going back into these products and historically and these are not historical times but historically theres a tremendous resiliency in our feebased portfolios and so youll see a lot of value injection into those feebased cards as i had mentioned before the one thing i will say and then ill let jeff talk sort of technically to the costs what i think is critically important for us is that we support our customers i mean i started out during this crisis we moved rapidly to get our colleagues out of our facilities within a twoweek time period we were basically virtual around the world the only people youll find in our buildings today are security people and maintenance people and not a lot of them and so we rapidly moved that once we did that our next focus really turned to our customers and what was really important through this crisis and through any crisis and ive talked about this over the last sort of quarters or so is that it was important for us to protect our brand it was important for us to be there for our customers and it was important for us to stick with those initiatives that inevitably would be important when this crisis ended merchant coverage will be important our efforts in china will be important our platform initiatives will be important and so while we are very focused on staying financially strong were also focused on ensuring that when this crisis is over we have been there for our customers and are ready to continue to hit the ground running and so we talked a lot about what we stopped what we accelerated and what weve slowed down and ill tell you the billion of costs that we cut out of our plan and ive been doing cost cutting for decades at this company was probably one of the largest cost cuts that weve ever done and this is not a run rate number this was billion out of the plan in the next eight months and some of that money will be put back in for value injection so the reality is is there more to go it is always more to go there will always be more to go we decided to do no layoffs and the reason we decided to do no layoffs is theres numerous reasons for that number one is humanitarian aspect of this number two is the disruption to try and lay off people in a virtual environment is nearly impossible and number three we dont know what the world is going to look like american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 and so while were not going to take layoffs off the table for the future we certainly are taking layoffs off the table for the rest of the year ill let jeff comment on sort of the technical aspect of where we have that opportunity but you saw a large reduction yearoveryear in operating costs and most of your models assumed growth in operating costs so that came right out as well but jeff let me turn it to you jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co well the only thing id add steve is to your point you can always react further sanjay to the environment and we asked ourselves two questions on costs we took out everything we didnt need to support customers as steve said and we left things in or we cut everything that couldnt be put back quickly or that we made sure we werent cutting things that couldnt be put back quickly in the inevitable rebound the other point i would make is were not hiring people today so the reality is when you have people and you stop external hiring with each passing quarter our costs will be going down and also with each passing quarter since you phrased the question as what if the world really radically changes and stays down for a long time with each passing quarter our view of what we might need to put back is going to change so we will continue to react so we should go to the next question operator operator audio gap will come from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc steve certainly good to see your billed business growth stabilizing in april i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about coming out of the crisis in you guys took share a lot of the banks were short in capital or struggling with capital issues how do you think the competitive dynamic looks on the other side of this and do you think that you can be opportunistic and take share stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well don certainly thats the intent i mean thats the intent as jeff just said about not shutting down these channels if you shut down completely your acquisition channels whether that be digital whether that be direct mail if you start cutting your sales organization and so forth obviously its going to be hard to do that its hard to say where our competitors are overall in their overall business our business is as you know very monolithic the only piece of our business that we have to focus on is the credit card business whether that is corporate small business and premium consumer how this whole pandemic plays out across all the other aspects of the financial services industry is yet to be seen whats going to be the impact on commercial real estate commercial lending car loans mortgages so forth and so on american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 traditionally whats happened is we have bounced back a lot quicker our card base tends to be a lot more resilient and there is pentup demand for our products and services this is not a traditional environment that were in but our intent is to come out of this very very strong with our sales channels intact with our acquisition engines pumping and actually to take share as we did in and as we did after the internet bubble thats the intent which is why were sticking with a number of the growth initiatives and more importantly while its easy to cut back on merchant acquisition when all of this is said and done people are going to have a huge pentup desire to spend and we want to make sure were able to continue to provide the access to all the alternatives that are available to spend from a merchant perspective operator our next question will come from the line of mark devries with barclays go ahead mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thank you and i just want to thank you for the new slides theres some very good disclosure there so my question is on the impact of the loan book if we see billed business at these levels what sort of runoff should we expect and what are the implications of that for a need to maybe resume share repurchases to avoid getting too capitalinefficient jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co well its a good question mark i think when you think about our loan book theres of course a fair amount of just transactors in there so i think you will probably if the world stays as it is today i see a more significant decline in the loan book in the second quarter depending on how the world evolves i frankly pass that and might expect a little bit more stabilization from a capital perspective the thing we are really focused on is making sure we stay really strong financially so we can be opportunistic about some of the things steve was just talking about trying to gain some share in the inevitable rebound or other opportunities that might come up in the current environment the last point id make is that does mean when growth resumes the balance sheet then goes in the opposite direction than it grows so we need to make sure that we have enough capital to support very rapid growth when the inevitable rebound happens and so what does that mean for share repurchase boy i think like so many things mark we have to take that quarterbyquarter and see where we are mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co thanks mark american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 operator our next question will come from the line of rick shane with jpmorgan go ahead please one moment richard shane q analyst jpmorgan is well operator mr shane your line is open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan can you hear me stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yes richard shane q analyst jpmorgan okay great thanks for taking my question i hope everybody is well there when we look at the change in reserve under cecl charge was going to be treated was going to have a very favorable treatment and there was a pretty significant spike in the cecl and the reserve this quarter im assuming that thats associated with small business is that correct and second part of that question is there an opportunity to move some of the charge product to pay over time to give some relief jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co so youre correct rick that the charge reserves under cecl were actually to remind everyone a reduction from the reserves we used to have under fas whereas obviously the lending reserves went in the other direction youre also correct that when you look at charge and when you look at our loan book today i think its fair to say that the sector that has shown the most immediate stress is small business right you shut down small businesses and a savvy business owner is going to say boy i need to go into cash conservation mode and in many ways what our pandemic relief programs are about is trying to help people through that transition and so the question really is how long do shutdowns last can we help bridge our small business customers long enough to help them resume business and were exploring every possible avenue about how you help them with payment terms and fee deferrals et cetera to help them come back strong and help the economy grow stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah and i think the other thing from a small business perspective these are people that are not used to being in this situation at all i mean you think about every other credit crisis weve ever had no one ever shut down we american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 never shut down the economy right i mean things got hard things got tough but we never shut down the economy and when you look at small businesses and you look at sort of the credit profile of our small businesses these are people that would have high fico and theyre prime and super prime as well much like consumers and if you look at our programs that we have the programs are one to three months of relief then we have shortterm programs and then we have our longer hardship programs so i think well be in good shape there because its really getting people through this tumultuous period as far as the charge product the charge product has a payovertime feature its called lending on charge and so people could use that but they could also use one of our hardship programs and i think one of the things that were really focused on is retaining membership at the end of this so what is the carrot at the end these are good customers who are in a bad time through no fault of their own and wed like to retain them as customers and so as you look at our programs and how were structuring them were also structuring them with a way to return to the franchise over time so thats an answer to your other question operator our next question will be from bill carcache with nomura go ahead bill carcache q analyst nomura thanks good morning steve and jeff is there any indication jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co good morning bill bill carcache q analyst nomura hi there is there any indication that the customers who are filing for initial claims are broadly representative of the amex customer base theres been some suggestion that a disproportionate percentage of those filing are for example entrylevel restaurant employees who may not be representative of the amex population and therefore some of the traditional relationships that weve seen between initial claims and reserve building could break down i would appreciate your thoughts on that jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co well i think bill id start by pointing back to something i said in my remarks which is i think its worth noting that over of the balances us consumer and small business enroled in the program are from prime and super prime card members and this goes back i think steve to your point these are not people who are used to being in stress its just such an unprecedented environment and so look well have to see how this plays out but these are good card members on the consumer side and thriving businesses until they suddenly were forced by the government to shut down on the small business side and thats why were really focused on working hard with them to help bridge the current environment and also hopefully let some of the government programs kick in and help american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 operator our next question will be from bob napoli with william blair go ahead robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc good morning steve jeff glad you guys are well and appreciate the call and all the additional detail the world is i mean the postcovid19 world is going to change i think at least somewhat im sure weve all been on a lot of zoom calls or microsoft teams calls or whatever but business travel has been an important part of your business i think consumer travel will return but business travel may be less materially less b2b payments i think youre involved in b2b payments and through several partnerships with the billcom or several other companies mineraltree et cetera but what are your thoughts on how the world is going to change and how does amex prepare for that on the b2b payment side are you seeing more demand for stuff like ap automation as well i know its a small part of your business stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so its a great question and we obviously listened to ed bastians earnings call yesterday and you know what ed said its probably going to take three years for travel to come back to where it is and lets just put this in context i think because i think thats really important when you think about our commercial payments business the majority of our commercial payments business is small business both in the us international and middle market and a majority of that is nonte with a focus on exactly what you talked about when you look at our corporate card business our corporate card business is between and of our overall billings of that is te so youre looking at about of our overall business which drives a lower proportionate share of not only revenue but net income as well i think that will slow down but remember in te youve got multiple components youve got restaurants youve got hotel youve got car rental and you do have air and so i think weve all learned in this environment how to work virtually it is amazing we dont use zoom but we do use webex but it is amazing to see everybody on a webex screen and quite honestly i think therell be more of that there will be less of those trips that are needed and so i think you will see an inevitable decline in probably air travel youll still see people making trips in cars youll still see people going to restaurants albeit restaurants will probably be reconfigured in the short term but in the long term i think it comes back pretty much to normal and so when you look at te i think the travel piece of it and then the appropriate stay and the meal that goes along will probably go down itll be a little bit of a reset moment but our focus really has been on large corporate and i said this before not a lot of people were sort of driving te high i mean they were sort of looking to maintain te to reduce te and our focus with large corporate has been on b2b payments what we have seen in this short period of time is more automation of b2b payments it is a small part of our business but with in a virtual environment it has gone up significantly i mean not significantly enough to drive american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 our overall volumes at this particular point in time but it is amazing how much its gone up from an automation perspective with our acompay acquisition with our integrations into billcom and mineraltree and sage and others like sap so i think youll see more of a focus on that i think youll see more spending there and i think you will see an inevitable decline in some of the business travel and entertainment i think the consumer travel will come back over time and i think the other thing is i am really happy with sort of the cobrand partners that we have and ed talked about this on his call yesterday that from an airline perspective safety will be defined in multiple ways now safety was defined from a maintenance perspective but its also now going to be defined on how you treat your customers within the plane its going to be how you treat your customers within the hotel property and i think when i think about ed and arnie and chris nassetta were of equal minds there from a way to treat our customers and so i think youll see a premiumness return actually to air travel and i think that plays well for our customer base as well and i think in this time i think our acquisition of resy is going to play really well in the short term as restaurants will probably reduce capacity and will be harder to get reservations and well be able to utilize as we talk about access and experiences our assets to be able to help our card members get into and experience some of the great restaurants that are around this country operator our next question will come from the line of moshe orenbuch with credit suisse go ahead please moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks i wanted to follow up on that steve because i think that you made some interesting points at the beginning about issues around your cobranded programs and the spending being kind of around outside of the partner and the comments that you just made about kind of being special and at the top of the pile but i guess the question that i have is the fees that youve just raised on a lot of those cobrand the highend cards the actual benefits that the partner provides whether its delta or one of the hotel chains kind of are going to be less valuable to people at this point and so how do you think about what people do whether they downtier or actually shift the spending to another card and how does that process work stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah i think what youll see in the coming weeks is youll see other benefits thatll be added to those cards to sort of balance out the value i mean look were very focused on it obviously if you go on any blog a blog is very focused on what is the value that you get for what youre paying and so youll see enhancements to those cards that are not specifically either air or hotelrelated and in particular to those cards where fees were raised and so youll see extensions on benefits but youll also see other things that are nonhotel nonairrelated which will provide more utility to the card in general i mean people have those cards to accumulate points for hotel stays for airline and for so forth but i think as i said and you just pointed out again of that spend is in other areas and so what well do is well enhance those products so that the value propositions are more in an equilibrium to what the environment is today american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 and thats what well continue to do which is why i think having built the dna in the company now to constantly refresh products is very important and not just constantly refresh them on a sort of we run a to 4year cycle but the ability within a couple of months now to add other benefits and to add other credits and other access and things like that will serve us well as we go through this because were going to watch it very carefully were going to work with our partners very carefully to put those benefits that will continue to maintain the value and continue to maintain the price value that we strive to have with these cards so i think its a great question and thats what the teams are working on with our partners operator next question will be from betsy graseck with morgan stanley go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thank you good morning steve and jeff jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co good morning betsy stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i know we spoke a little bit earlier about small business it is the single biggest question that i get on american express ranging from credit quality questions to persistency of the business as we go through this covid19 crisis so i just wondered if you could refresh your comments with some more details around how you see the credit quality the different industries that are really dominating your small business portfolios and if you could help us understand how long you feel your partners or your small business customers are set up to endure this shutdown that they have to deal with jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co well maybe ill start betsy with a few comments and then steve can chime in so i am going to start by reciting for a third time the statistic i pointed out earlier that when you look across both consumer and small business because many of our small business card members while they run their small business on the card they still have credit scores and personal fico scores we can track so of those people are prime and super prime and i just think thats an important first thing to think about second we have i think a lot more diversity in our small business card members than perhaps many people realize and so steve you were just talking earlier about the importance of restaurants to our value propositions and our partnership with resy if you look at our open card members thats actually restaurants are fairly immaterial part of the card member base american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 and in fact the card member base is in some places you might not think about intuitively betsy like construction building materials professional services lawyers doctors and if you think about many of those kinds of small businesses those are the businesses that are going to come back and thrive but clearly when the government tells them youve got to shut the doors they would be i think financially irresponsible if they didnt say boy for a little while i could pay american express but i just need to kind of hold on to my cash while i understand the environment and thats a lot of the anecdotal dialogue were having with our customers so well have to see as we said all along and i think that the question is how long does unemployment stay at the astronomical levels it appears to be at now and how long do small businesses stay shut down stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co but steve you can add a little more to that stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah no i think its a great question and its one that we look at all the time but jeff said a small percentage its less than of our small business customers are actually restaurants and when you look at sort of almost of our small business customers its things like contractors plumbing electrical work air conditioning all those things are actually still continuing today maybe at a more reduced level because people dont want other people in the house but theyre not going those people are not going to go anywhere and they usually have a lot of low overhead but they may need that three months to get through it and when you look at business services its legal its automotive repair its beauty salons barber shops things like that and a lot of those will still be there and come back as a lot of them are single proprietor institutions the other thing that ill point out about are small businesses while we do have a very high share of the market from a spend perspective when you look at the overall sort of loan books whether that be working capital whether that be mortgage loans auto loans that small businesses have just their own loan servicing were probably less than of the us market when it comes from an exposure perspective so when i look at it from a credit perspective i think you just cant look at the card you need to look at the entire small business sort of ecosystem of what is out there and were less than of that and i would also leave you with the fact we are very very diverse in terms of what our small business set is so we think itll bounce back and we feel good about our small business portfolio but it will go through like everything else itll go through a tough period of time until the world starts to open again which is why we think our relief programs are ideally suited for small businesses operator our next question will come from eric wasserstrom with ubs go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks so much can you hear me okay stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc oh thats great thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co not quite but we think we can get it eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc all right good good good so my question is about the credit experience just doing a quick backofthe envelope from your ph acl ratio to just maybe an expectation of around a 45ish kind of percent peak loss experience and im wondering if you can maybe put that in context of past downturns i think as i recall from your peak quarter of losses in its something like something like that so i was wondering if you could just maybe put that in context and maybe the broader question is does this circumstance perhaps suggest or has it caused you to reconsider whether expanding lending is most valuemaximizing for amex jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co so let me maybe make a few comments about the credit reserve steve and then you might talk about risk management in the current environment so eric gosh if you think about past experiences the great financial crisis i think it took six quarters for the economy to get up to close to unemployment rates and in the current environment in six weeks we appear to have gone way beyond that so that makes it very hard to predict exactly how things are going to play out clearly if unemployment stays at the level it is at now then you should expect lifetime losses across the entirety of the financial services sector that are greater than what you saw in the great financial crisis on the other hand the government is throwing unprecedented amounts of money at things here well have to see where that goes im also not sure peak writeoff rates really make are a useful way to think about this right under cecl were trying to every quarter close the books and put on the books a reserve for the lifetime losses we expect for what loans and receivables are on the books and thats what we did as we closed the books in april now well have to see where we are at the end of june american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 but i am going to close before i turn it over to steve by saying but unemployment today is worse than it was in the great financial crisis and worse than it was in any ccardfas test and youve tacked on to that shutting down small businesses in the us so well have to see how long that goes stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so let me answer the last part of the question is there a regret to be in lending and the answer is no i dont think you can be in a payments business without providing a wide range of services and so i think our strategy of lending through our customers and understanding who were lending to i think that will play out for us well during this pandemic i think the other thing is whats important to note is that you go back a couple of years we really started to even invest even more heavily in our credit capabilities and so the difference between and today is a chasm i mean were not even the same company as it relates to it when i think about what weve done from an external monitoring perspective how we do modeling and risk assessment whether its machine learning and how we do more through the cycle evaluation just our overall customer evaluation our ability to flex up and down spend and lend capacity the way we risk price and our credit and collections capability are so much better including our hardship programs i mean we had no hardship programs through the great financial crisis and now we roll out the cpr program in a matter of weeks we have other programs that are coming out in addition to our traditional hardship programs which by the way were not traditional in i think the key thing as we move forward through this cycle will be our constant evaluation of our customers our constant ability to modify the spend and lend that we have and our credit and collections capabilities and our ability to be able to talk to our customers understand their situations and really work with them so that those customers that are have the potential to be good customers when this is over we ensure that we were there for them so i think i dont regret sort of expanding our lending at all and i think we are much better positioned much much better positioned than we were in and much better positioned than we were just two years ago operator our next question will be from ryan nash with goldman sachs go ahead please ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co good morning ryan stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc maybe just a followup on the last question so you talked about of customers being prime super prime but jeff you also mentioned that unemployment is higher than where we were in the financial crisis so i guess do you have any visibility on where job loss is across your customer base how that plays into your loss forecasting and i guess broadly speaking just how do we think about the relationship between job losses and unemployment across your customer base thanks jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co well i think weve said for a while that certainly general levels of unemployment while its just one of many many many factors that influences our ultimate credit losses is probably the single most important factor i think your question also goes to though when we look at our consumer customer base we would believe that the unemployment levels amongst our customers are well below the general levels of unemployment when you think about who has gotten laid off when you look at small business small businesses we talked earlier about the range of actual card members we have who are small businesses and theyre in lots of different industries but you have probably a more representative sample amongst our card member base because we cut across all industries and if a small business gets shut down thats a tough thing in the short run for them so well have to see how this plays out but i think im going to go back to where steve kind of finished his last answer weve built tremendously stronger risk management capabilities over the last decade we have taken many steps in the last couple of years to tighten up our risk management practices and we go into this i would remind you with bestinclass credit metrics we think we have bestinclass capabilities and we think we have a customer base both consumer and small business that absolutely is more premiumoriented that should help us depending on whatever the outcome is here economically operator our next question will come from craig maurer with autonomous go ahead please craig maurer q analyst autonomous research us lp yeah good morning steve and jeff stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning craig jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co hi craig american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 craig maurer q analyst autonomous research us lp so two questions i was hoping you could update us on your us regional exposures and secondly in what im sure have been extensive conversations with ed bastian and others can you provide a little bit of thought around how you expect travel to reemerge in terms of cross border versus domestic one of the biggest debates we currently have with investors is the pace at which crossborder travel can resume thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co so let me stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co go ahead jeff yeah jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co quickly hit the regional one steve and then you can talk about travel because the regional answer craig is pretty short which is i think as you would expect where are heavy concentrations of our premiumoriented card member base is well placed in like california the northeast texas all places that have been fairly significantly hit within the us when you go outside in the us particularly in the big urban areas the londons the paris the tokyos so id say we are right in the mainstream of the covid19 challenge when it comes regionally we dont particularly see any differences though when we look across all those regions and countries in terms of credit performance or volume performance its remarkably similar globally i would say stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so look i talk to ed probably once a week not only are we good partners but were good friends as well and i think he would tell you that you will see more emergence of domestic travel before you see crossborder and the reason you will see that is i think look i mean how will countries open up their borders to inbound flights number one and how will the psychology work from a consumer perspective i think therell be a pentup demand to do something in the summertime in september but i think a lot of us consumers will probably do that in the united states may do that in the islands so i think travel will emerge more domestically first than it will internationally having said that i talked to willie walsh a couple of weeks ago and at ba and their flights to china are going back and forth and relatively full as those markets reopen as well so i think its going to be it will be interesting but i think what is going to make the difference here is how safe you make your airline and how safe you make the travel experience and certainly we will work with ed and our other partners to do our part to help that american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 whether its from a boarding process and hell take care once youre on a plane they do a fantastic job and he and his team are thinking about those things and im sure they will come up with a really highquality and premium product as they always do but i do believe domestic will emerge more than crossborder and i think itll take more time to get back to cross border travel would be my sense and i think thats obviously a better question for ed and the other airline executives but we do have sort of a dog in this fight as well but i think thats what will happen craig vivian y zhou senior vice president head of investor relations american express credit corp with that we will bring the call to an end thank you steve thank you jeff thank you again for joining todays call and thank you for your continued interest in american express the
