and christophe with that let me turn it over to steve stephen j squeri chairman and chief executive officer american express co good morning and thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call we had another strong quarter that reflects the steady earnings power of our business model and our continued investments for growth earnings per share in the third quarter were and revenues were billion up over last year marking our 10th consecutive quarter of record revenues based on our performance todate and the strong earnings were generating we are raising our fullyear eps guidance to between and up from to and we continue to expect fullyear revenue growth that is within the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year at around i feel good about our performance todate and the ongoing strength of our business and i remain confident in our longterm growth prospects a key reason for my confidence is the sustainability of our product refresh strategy and the growth it is generating across our portfolio we have already achieved our plan of refreshing products globally this year and we expect to do several more by yearend as we do so were adding value to our offerings by embedding new benefits and services that reflect the financial and lifestyle needs of our existing premium card members and attract new ones american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 a great example of this is the us consumer gold card we talk a lot about the platinum card and with good reason but the gold card is also a critically important product in our portfolio gold is a very popular product with total us consumer gold acquisitions currently running at about higher than platinum and its our number one premium product for millennial and gen z consumers with of us gold cards we acquire coming from this cohort in designing the refresh gold card which we launched in the third quarter we know that millennials and gen zs are especially interested in dining in fact these younger card members transact almost two times more on dining and make up a higher percentage of users on our resy restaurant booking platform than other generations in our card member base with that in mind we enhanced the alreadyrich dining benefits that come with gold card membership and as weve done with other refreshes the value of the additional benefits is greater than the annual fee increases while its very early days were seeing strong new account acquisitions and continued high retention levels among existing us gold card members indicating that our customers see real value in the enhancements weve made this is a pattern we see when we refresh our products we add value that resonates with premium customers and we price for that enhanced value which results in strong acquisition and retention numbers that drive spending and consistently strong growth in subscriptionlike fee revenues the gold card is just one example of how dining is playing an increasingly integral role in our membership model dining is an important category across our premium customer base in fact spending on restaurants continues to be one of our fastest growing te categories in our us consumer business increasing in  versus last year and growing at nearly twice the industry rate overall since and with total restaurant and foodservice spend estimated at trillion in the us dining represents a significant opportunity for us to further differentiate amex membership this is why were investing in building out our dining capabilities first with the acquisition of resy in and more recently with the additions of tock and rooam both of which have closed since we announced them in  weve made significant progress todate weve successfully scaled resy since acquiring the company with over million registered users and in the last months alone the platform has seated over million diners were also embedding resy benefits in several of our value propositions including the us gold card i just mentioned as well as our us consumer platinum card and the refresh premium delta skymiles cobrand cards we announced in february in addition to the many benefits for card members resy strengthens our membership model in other important ways it connects our restaurant merchants with high spending premium customers while also providing them with stateoftheart technology platform that helps them grow their businesses furthermore resys large user base gives us access to a pool of potential prospects who enjoy dining but do not yet have an american express card our newest acquisitions will expand on the benefits we offer consumers and merchants driving value for both tock extends our dining footprint with millions of additional users and thousands more bookable venues including wineries hotels and certain events in addition to restaurants with rooam hospitality merchants can have access to sophisticated integration capabilities across various restaurant management platforms and the ability to enhance live event and stadium experiences american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 while the competition is fierce in the dining space we believe our business model advantages including our premium customer base the strong merchant relationship we have with restaurants and other hospitality providers and our membership model position us well to continue our growth in this important category as we demonstrated the investments we continue to make in our value propositions as reflected in our product refresh strategy and in our capabilities as seen in the example of dining are fueling our momentum and these are just a couple of the examples of why i remain confident that our longterm growth aspirations are the right ones thank you and ill now turn it over to christophe for more detailed look at our performance in the quarter christophe le caillec chief financial officer american express co thank you steve and good morning everyone before going into the details of our third quarter results id like to take a few minutes to step back and highlight the key takeaways from our yeartodate performance first our business model is performing really well we had another solid quarter of earnings generation with eps of even as we continue to invest significantly in marketing and technology the spend environment has been stable over the course of the year and revenue growth is in line with our expectations with a yeartodate fx adjusted growth of we continue to add many more customers to the franchise transaction engagement is deepening and we benefit from our diverse set of customer types revenue streams and geographies in addition as steve discussed our focus on continuously refreshing products is resulting in an acceleration in our card fees revenue which grew by this quarter and our focus on premium products continues to be the foundation of our very strong credit performance we continue to manage our expense base with discipline yeartodate excluding the gain from accertify operating expenses have grown very modestly as we fully leverage the scale and the digitization of our operations this business model is yielding very strong earnings which is enabling us to increase investments to grow the franchise and also to return excess capital to our shareholders compared to last year we reduced the number of shares outstanding by million turning now to our  spend performance on slide billed business grew on an fx adjusted basis continuing the trend of stable volume growth that weve been seeing over the past several quarters and while te growth rates are now more in line with what were seeing on goods and services spending the picture hasnt changed very much since last quarter our customers continue to deepen their engagement with their american express card as the number of transactions was up in  this is a function of growth in the number of customers and merchants as well as growth in the number of transactions per customer for instance transactions per customer are up around from five years ago as you look at the spend trends by segment over the next few slides i want to highlight a few key points to take away spend across our affluent us consumer base continued to be very stable with strong growth from millennial and gen z customers up notably we continued to see very strong loyalty with this younger cohort with new customer retention higher than that of older generations american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 within commercial services spend growth was up modestly and consistent with where weve seen over the past few quarters our fastestgrowing segment again this quarter is international card services with spend growth of the breadth of this continued performance is especially worth noting every one of our five top markets is growing in doubledigits with four out of the five in mid to highteens for example japan is up and mexico on an fx adjusted basis we also see strong engagement from millennial and gen z customers in international with the age cohort growing fx adjusted in  let me now turn to lending and credit performance on slide through total loans and card member receivables growth was strong at yearoveryear and continued to moderate as expected loan growth was this quarter consistent with  our enhanced lending capabilities such as pay over time continue to be the largest contributor to our loan growth in addition over of revolving loan growth continues to be driven by tenured customers looking ahead we continue to see a long runway for growth as we expand our share of lend with our premium card members while revolve rates have largely billed back since the pandemic we expect to see continued upward momentum over time as we meet more of our customers borrowing needs on our premium products and grow our charge and cobrand portfolios our focus on growing lending through our premium customer base also continues to pay off in the strength of our credit performance delinquency rates remain very low and in line with our prior quarters especially taking into account the seasonal downtick we saw in  and writeoff rates declined to this quarter looking forward i still expect a modest upward bias to these rates as we continue to acquire new customers at elevated levels and increase our share of lending from existing customers this quarter we had about billion of provision expense this includes a reserve bill of million which was predominantly driven by loan volume growth the reserve rate was consistent with recent quarters taking a step back this bestinclass credit metrics are a reflection of our strategy our product value propositions create a powerful positive selection effect which carries through to better credit performance our risk management strategies and capabilities widen the margin of safety and ensure profitable growth focusing next on revenues starting on slide as i noted earlier we grew total revenues net of interest by discount revenue our largest revenue line grew versus last year and is driven by the spend trends i discussed earlier net card fees increased on an fx adjusted basis accelerating points sequentially driven in part by the product refreshes and we continue to see strong demand for our products as we bring new customers into the franchise with new cards acquired of million in the quarter our strong acquisition and retention levels along with our ongoing cycle of refreshing products continue to drive sustainable growth in card fee revenue this strong growth represents a real proof point of the success of our strategy and the continued engagement of our customers turning to our lending economics on slide net interest income grew on an fx adjusted basis and continues to moderate as we previously communicated growth in this line is driven by increases in revolving loan balances and net yield versus the prior american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 ill turn now to our expense performance on slide our vce to revenue ratio remained stable at this quarter with variable customer engagement expenses up versus last year looking at some of the components of vce rewards expense this quarter grew outpacing spend growth we are continuously evolving the ph mr value proposition to increase the ease of redemption for our card members and also to maintain the economics of the program in the short term those changes drive a very small increase in the ultimate rate of redemption but all the time we are confident in the economics with minimal impact to the vce ratio and we continue to invest in our card member benefits to deliver superior experiences for our customers for example this year weve added over new hotels to the hotel collection program one of the benefits on the gold card and we see that yeartodate bookings on the program are times higher than years ago marketing expense was billion in line with our run rate so far this year as we continue to invest at elevated levels versus last year as i mentioned last quarter we expect our fullyear marketing spend for to be around billion as we lean into the attractive growth opportunities available to us lastly operating expenses of about billion were up versus last year there is some seasonality to operating expense levels and we expect to see a slight uptick in  consistent with prior years trend on a full year basis we continue to expect operating expenses to remain fairly flat yearoveryear adjusting for the accertify gain taking a step back total expenses yeartodate are up about relative to growth in fx adjusted revenue this is a reflection of our ability to invest at elevated levels and drive strong expense leverage let me now move to capital on slide our cet1 ratio was well within our to range and we returned billion in capital to our shareholders this capital return included billion of share repurchases the highest level in the past two years and billion in dividends also we continue to have a very robust and diverse funding stack at our disposal our highyield savings balances grew by yearoveryear this quarter notably over of balances come from existing card members though less than of our us consumer customers have a high yield savings account with us this brings me to our guidance for the full year we expect revenue growth of around within the revenue guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year we are also raising our fullyear eps guidance to to reflecting both the momentum and the earnings power of our business this represents to yearoveryear growth it is higher than we expected at the start of the year and above our longterm aspiration of midteens growth with that i will now turn the call back over to kartik and we will take your questions kartik ramachandran senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co thank you christophe before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions operator american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question is coming from sanjay sakhrani of kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning appreciate the solid results in what clearly is a softer spending backdrop i guess im just thinking about the updated guidance and as we think about that 10plus revenue expectation in the future i mean is that possible in the current spending backdrop next year as i think about it nii will be slower card fees obviously should be stronger but does billed business have to accelerate to get to double digits or is there another way thanks stephen j squeri a chairman and chief executive officer american express co thank sanjay look i think that billed business definitely has to accelerate to get to our aspirational goal of revenue growth when you think about the three legs of the stool that we have to grow our revenues i think we absolutely have the right balance the balance of spending nii and card fees and card fees continue to grow at accelerated rates its straight quarters now of double digit we had this quarter nii continues to chug along but i dont think anybody wants to see us really accelerate too much from there and i think that as we think about our overall aspiration that aspiration was set in a more robust environment and so for us to hit that we would need to have an acceleration in billings certainly an acceleration from having said that and i said this about a year ago at the goldman sachs conference we have driven the scale of this business at this point to such a place that even with a softer albeit consistently its been consistently soft for the last pretty much for the last year if you go back our billings overall for pretty much the last year other than the second quarter when we had the extra day have been about overall but yet we are able to deliver on our midteens eps growth and i think thats what our focus is really on and so as the economy gets stronger when that is i dont know but i think its absolutely the right aspiration for us as a company to strive for revenue growth but we will need an acceleration in billings operator thank you the next question is coming from ryan nash of goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys and steve thank you for the branding of our conference on the prior response so maybe just a followup on sanjays question when you think about the three legs of the stool if we dont see an acceleration in billings growth can you maybe just talk about the drivers of eps growth into can you continue to sustain the midteens growth even in the face of a challenging of a slowerthanaspirational revenue growth environment thank you stephen j squeri a chairman and chief executive officer american express co yeah i mean just if you look at this year as i just said weve had billings growth of pretty much for almost a year now and so ill just go back to my comments that i made to sanjay i think at the level of that overall billings growth and we continue to acquire cards and we continue to upgrade card members and we continue to american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 grow nii where we are yeah i think eps growth in the range in our midteens range is absolutely something that should be expected from us the other thing that i would say is that while we are not if you look at this year weve acquired million cards in the first quarter and million cards in the second quarter and million cards in the third quarter and thats all about really the future for us and as the economy gets stronger these are cohorts and most of these people that were acquiring are millennials and gen zs these are cohorts that will continue to grow with us that will see an uptick in organic spending over time that will wind up being upgraded from green to a gold a gold to a platinum and so forth and so once again i think that were really laying the foundation with the investments that were making for strong growth going forward christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah maybe i will just add one point this year indeed is a good reference right and were going to grow eps north of the midteens even when you control for the accertify gain and thats after increasing the marketing investments yearoveryear by as much as million right and so that speaks about the power of generating midteens eps growth despite a billing growth operator thank you the next question is coming from craig maurer of ft partners please go ahead craig maurer q analyst ft partners yeah good morning thanks i wanted to ask about business development spend came in well below what consensus was expecting and i was curious what is happening there whether it was a shortterm phenomenon or something more long term and just second was there any impact from weather in the guide for the rest of the year thanks stephen j squeri a chairman and chief executive officer american express co ill answer the second question and christophe will answer the first one no there was no impact at all from weather in the guide at all christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah and under business or partner payments line and business development a lot of those expenses are about the agreement that we have with customers and cobrand partners in terms of sharing the economics of the co brands and specifically in terms of this quarter the reason why that number is not growing as much as maybe you were expecting is because on the corporate side we also have agreements in terms of incentives that we pay back to our customers and since the billing is coming at a lower level so are those incentives that we pay back to their customers operator thank you the next question is coming from rick shane of jpmorgan please go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my question this morning look as we move into the fourth quarter the setup is that earnings will be way above the initial guidance and even above the second quarter increase and revenues are gravitating towards the lowend of your range that suggests credit and operating leverage are better than you expected youve talked about the ramp in marketing the incremental million historically when earnings are the earnings setup is this strong you really pull forward investments planting seeds for longterm revenue growth im curious this year why youre letting so much fall to the bottom line are you starting as you ramp up that million incremental are you starting to see the marginal return on those investments diminish in a way that its no longer attractive stephen j squeri a chairman and chief executive officer american express co no i dont think were seeing the marginal return i think its a matter of ramping its just ramping up to the level that we are i mean when you think about how much we are how much we are spending on a relative basis at billion almost billion billion in marketing were stepping up that marketing almost million weve also stepped up technology spend weve invested were investing more in control management as we move from a category bank to a category bank and so were not walking away from any investments and its but were also not rick what were also not doing is were not lowering our standards in any way either so no i think that weve ramped up our investments all year long it is just really hard to then just jam a bunch more investment into next year having said that we expect that we will grow our investment levels from here as we move into i would not expect a pullback in marketing because as we start to look at next year were looking for more efficiencies obviously in our marketing spend but additionally were looking to invest more in marketing as we move into next year and more in technology and so forth so when you think about the business from a quartertoquarter basis yeah its easy to have that the assumption that you have when you think about the business on a continuum you have to layer in your investments over time so its not as easy just to pull sort of investments in from the first quarter of next year into the fourth quarter of this year years ago we could do that because our investment levels were probably half of where they are today and so as you get to that level that we are today it is easier to go on a continuum the way were going as opposed to hey look theres an opportunity lets just pull it forward so we feel good about the investment opportunities over the next over the medium to long range and well continue to invest in the business operator thank you the next question is coming from erika najarian of ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning when i look at the supplement it does seem like spend on a permember basis has been a little bit flatter than overall spend growth versus and clearly thats a result of your success in having so many new customers if we dont get to rebound in spend growth next year and obviously everyone is trying to figure out whether were going to have the soft landing or not the soft landing how much runway do you feel you american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 have to continue to add new customers to keep the spend growth at the current level and maybe as a compound question to that maybe give us some color on where we are on the product refresh cycle stephen j squeri a chairman and chief executive officer american express co yeah so let me answer the second part and go to the first i think on the product refresh cycle weve already were at our that we had committed to at the beginning of the year and there will be some more refreshes that will be done over the rest of this year and we will continue refreshing on next year ill let christophe comment a little bit but ill just give you a couple of other points as it relates to your first question we still see line of sight as we move into next year to acquire more cardholders i think when you look at the overall spending organic spending in our customer base is not as robust as it was in a more robust environment and thats what our cardholders do what our cardholders will do is pull back slightly if they lose any confidence see any sort of signs of their own stress but they will continue to pay their bills and thats why our credit numbers are so good i think when you look at the organic piece of this you see this especially within our small business our small business has been hit from a macro perspective i think just like a lot of other companies small business in that the organic spend was the samestore sales spend that is occurring on the card in small businesses is certainly not as robust as it was coming out of the pandemic in fact it is negative because when you look at our small business our acquisition is good and our retention is really good it is that organic spend thats down and so that organic spend leads to a slight depression in spend per card member christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah and so to adapt to the other part of your question the metric youre looking at is an average is a global average so that adds up customers in australia and japan as well as in the us so its hard to read a lot of insights out of that metric so to give you a bit more color on how to think about those new card members that are joining the franchise we do see that they are more engaged than the past vintages if you want but when we look at the number of transaction per new card member that number is trending up in my prepared remarks i cited the metric of more transaction per new card member now than five years ago and we see that right and this is a function of better coverage not only in the us but also outside of the us and we stick to the premiumness of our acquisition not only we grew the number of card member as you pointed out but we are maintaining the fact that about of them are coming up on a feepaying product so they are very engaged and so each vintage if you want is definitely showing progress and whats impacting this average are the things that steve talked about and that the tenured card members and what we call the organic spend that is a little bit more challenged operator thank you the next question is coming from don fandetti of wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 steve the general consensus pretty much among everyone is that the affluent us consumer is in good shape i just wanted to get your sense if youre seeing anything in your data bookings that would raise concern around the sustainability of that youve got an election coming up and things of that nature stephen j squeri a chairman and chief executive officer american express co no i mean look this company has been around a long time i mean obviously we didnt have cards years ago but weve been around for lots of different elections lots of different configurations of the house the senate and so forth our customer base is very different than our competitors customer base and its really resilient and pretty stable i think that theyre continuing to spend albeit at not levels that we saw coming out of the pandemic but the us consumer just to pick the us consumer has been really stable i mean its been just about for the last few quarters and if you look at the international consumer and a lot of people forget we do have the international side of our business international consumer business has been growing for the last four quarters as well so were not seeing anything that would indicate that spending would go down and were not seeing anything that would indicate our credit metrics are getting any worse in fact you saw writeoffs go sequentially down and so we feel good about the consumer we would like to see more organic spend and i think to go back to the beginning when sanjay opened us up with that question i think an uptick in that organic spend will help us reach our overall aspiration of but thats why our aspiration of is in fact an aspiration and i think still the right aspiration for this company because we do expect organic to come back organic will not stay at this level forever when that comes back i dont know but regardless and as weve proven this year were able to still deliver that midteens eps growth operator thank you the next question is coming from jeff adelson of morgan stanley please go ahead jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning thanks for taking my question i guess just if we look at the approximately revenue growth for the year as you sit here only days into the quarter does that suggest that youre maybe looking for a little bit of a revenue growth reacceleration in the fourth quarter here or how are you thinking about that for the year could it maybe slip a little bit below that and when we look at the discount revenue growth it did go under the billed business growth a little bit this quarter i think the implied discount rate did drop a little bit is there any noise in there or is there something we should be aware of there christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co so ill take the second part of your question first in terms of how to think about the discount revenue versus the billed business as steve just mentioned international is growing at a faster clip than the us and as you probably know the discount rate in international is lower than the us so that creates a little bit of a disconnect between the growth you see in discount revenue and on billed business globally american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 as far as the first part of your question in terms of how to think about revenue growth and how to think about  the best way to the keyword that weve been using this morning is stability we see stability in terms of billings in terms of the trends and no inflection point so as you said we are only like a few weeks into  but my projection for  is to be a continuation of a lot of these trends so  is a good proxy for what to expect about  and thats why were guiding towards revenue growth i want to point out though that the eps in terms of fullyear performance is also way north of what we guided towards at the beginning of the year even when you adjust for accertify so were generating a lot of earnings even with being at revenue growth which still when i listen to peers it compares really well to most of our peers operator thank you the next question is coming from cris kennedy of william blair please go ahead cristopher kennedy q analyst william blair co llc good morning thanks for taking the question steve you mentioned how customers generally move from green cards to gold cards to platinum cards is there any way to think about the lifetime value or average spend by category thank you stephen j squeri a chairman and chief executive officer american express co i think when you start to move up the food chain you move up because youre going to for example youre moving from if youre a millennial for example and youre on a gold card youre probably not traveling as much but youre dining out a lot and youre maybe just starting with the franchise as you start to move along you might have a little bit more discretionary income youre traveling more youre taking advantage of lounges youre taking advantage of fine hotels and resorts and hotels and so you will see higher spending on platinum cards than you will on gold cards and on green cards because if youre going to pay a higher fee for a product youre going to engage in that product more youre going to use that product for what the benefits of that product in fact is and when you think about it the platinum card while its morphing into much more of a lifestyle card overall still has heavy travel benefits to it and to really take full advantage of that you want to be traveling and airline tickets cost money and hotels cost money and so forth so i think as people do move along the continuum you do have a higher lifetime value depending upon when you enter the franchise right so if you enter the franchise at a gold card level and ultimately upgrade to a platinum yes you will have a higher lifetime value overall to us if you enter as a gen xer or a boomer into the platinum franchise which we still acquire gen xers and boomers obviously you probably have a lower lifetime value than you would as a millennial who entered in as a gold card member so it all depends on the entry point but in general as they move up we get more value out of them operator thank you the next question is coming from saul martinez of hsbc please go ahead saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 hey good morning i wanted to ask about how to think about net interest income dynamics as we head into and just what the building blocks are steve i think you mentioned that you dont want to accelerate too much from here but if you could just christophe if you could just give us some of the building blocks in terms of how to think about nii in this rate environment your liabilitysensitive deposit dynamics revolve rates balances stuff like that if you could just kind of help us think through how to think about the evolution as we head out into christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co so the first thing maybe is to remind ourselves that we are slightly liabilitysensitive but only very slightly and the impact of fed funds rate cuts on our nii is actually quite small and we regularly update this sensitivity in our q and youll see later this afternoon we updated those numbers as well theyre really small and so maybe we can put this one out of the equation the rest is a volume rate balance so from a volume standpoint we have said that you should expect the volume the ar especially the revolving balances to moderate in terms of growth and the dynamic and were all familiar with it right during the pandemic people paid back the balances and have been rebuilding slowly their balances and the revolve rates that were seeing now are starting to stabilize and moderate so i think we are i would say this normalization is for the most part is behind us and so you expect now the growth rate to very much moderate and from a yield standpoint there are two things here right the first one is we keep shifting the funding of those balances towards highyield savings accounts which is the lowest funding cost for us and so this creates a positive impact a positive effect on the yield and on the interest income we keep working in terms of making sure we have the right price points we constantly compare our price as well against our peers and we make sure that we are wellpositioned there and so we should expect the yield to benefit from this dynamic but the way to think about it is moderation in terms of volume were going to maintain the strong yield that you see now and very very limited impact from any change in the rate environment from a fed fund rate standpoint operator thank you the next question is coming from terry ma of barclays please go ahead terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc hi thank you good morning so your card acquisitions continue to run at a pretty healthy level and your net card fee growth this quarter has already exceeded the exit rate of last year i guess are you running ahead of your expectations for some of these product refreshes in terms of adoption or engagement in general stephen j squeri a chairman and chief executive officer american express co yeah i think its what weve really expected from an adoption and engagement perspective as i said there will be a few more product refreshes this is where we pretty much expected the overall growth rate to be a little bit obviously higher than when we entered the year because thats what happens right people get attracted i think they get attracted to the products i think one of the things that weve said this before but i think its worth repeating when you refresh the product what it does it creates more demand in the american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 marketplace and it helps your marketing dollars work even harder for you and so when you look at how that category of revenue grows early on those categories are from new cardholders and remember we amortize that over a 12month period and not everybody gets repriced all at once so it does build in for us a rampingup effect of that overall category so not only is it important to upgrade these products because it enables you to attract new cardholders but it enables you to continue to engage with your existing cardholders but it does add to that obviously that overall subscriptionlike and saaslike revenues that card fee subscriptions are and were over billion in this particular quarter so we continue to focus on that because what we know is our feepaying card members are our most engaged cardholders that we have because they we want them to use the benefits and services operator thank you the next question is coming from mark devries of deutsche bank please go ahead mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah thank you i have a related question to the impact of fed easing on your business have you looked at kind of what the impact is from fed easing and the effort to stimulate the economy on your billed business growth christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co so this is a good point so at this point in time the reduction is too small its too early to see any impact in terms of the spend patterns and we looked into it but theres like nothing visible as you would expect probably too small but the expectation is that consumer and small business confidence is going to improve as a result of the rate environment being more supportive because as we said this morning right we see no evidence of stress in terms of credit we see demand in terms of our premium products we see very strong renewal rates even when card members are moving to a higher price point so theres definitely capacity to spend to spend more and my expectation is that the accumulation of cuts will provide some support for the consumer and small business confidence and that will provide some support to billing and to go back to the first question we addressed this morning especially to that organic growth that would benefit from that operator thank you our final question will come from mihir bhatia of bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning and thank you for taking my question wanted to turn to te spend for a second and just a twopart question on that the first is just on airline spend i think it accelerated this quarter can you just talk about the drivers there was it corporate consumer both what you saw there and then just on restaurant spending i think it deceled a little bit this quarter but just going back to the opening remarks steve you referenced just the investments youre making in that category between resy and tock and just adding those benefits to various cards do you expect restaurant spending as a category to become a bigger part of your business and grow like should we expect acceleration in that spending from here thanks american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 stephen j squeri a chairman and chief executive officer american express co yeah so let me talk about restaurant spending so when you look at before we made our foray into sort of the restaurant reservation business here with resy restaurant spending was not our biggest te category our biggest te category and still our fastestgrowing te category right now is restaurants and our expectations are that we will continue to gain share in that restaurant space if you look at it weve just over the last five years weve grown twice what the industry growth rate has been from a restaurant perspective yeah theres a little bit of a decel this quarter but i guess to but im not really all that concerned about that and i think with our tock acquisition and so forth i think we will continue to punch above our weight from a restaurant perspective ill just give you a high level on airline i dont think theres really a lot of change whether its from a corporate perspective or a consumer perspective from airline i mean you went from to i mean thats not in some cases it can just be a little rounding up or a little rounding down quartertoquarter but airline is still strong and as we said we saw international bookings i mean i didnt say this but we saw international bookings in the third quarter from our travel business actually be at the highest levels since before the pandemic so our card members are still looking to travel theyre looking at when youre traveling internationally you tend to spend a little bit more than when youre traveling domestically so i dont think theres much to read into the airline piece of it or the restaurant piece other than restaurant is still a very very strong category for us but the point up and point down i wouldnt make too much about for this particular quarter but i think that from a restaurant perspective we obviously are doublingdown on restaurant not only from the perspective of what weve done with the tock and rooam acquisition but just look at the gold card refresh which is a heavy dining product and its targeted at a cohort millennial and gen zs that spend more in dining than any other cohort that we have so were pretty bullish on the restaurant industry kartik ramachandran senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co with that we will bring the call to an end
