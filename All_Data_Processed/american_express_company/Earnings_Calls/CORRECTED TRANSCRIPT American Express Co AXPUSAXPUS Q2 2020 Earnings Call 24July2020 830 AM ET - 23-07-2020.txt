steve and jeff with that let me turn it over to steve stephen j squeri chairman chief executive officer american express co thanks vivian hello everybody and thanks for joining us on the call this morning i hope everyone is safe and well and your families are the same let me just jump in while overall results for the quarter clearly show the effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business jeff and i will dive into our performance on a more granular level to give you a clearer picture of whats going on when we last got together on april the global economy was basically in a freefall and we had no way of knowing if the declines we were seeing in our billings would continue we now realize that midapril was when we hit the trough in terms of second quarter spending declines as we sit here today there is still much uncertainty about the economic environment as reopenings have stalled in a number of geographies and the status of government support programs remains unclear nevertheless i can give you a better sense of where we are and how the covid19 crisis has been affecting us todate spending volumes overall have been improving gradually since april and they were down about yearover year to a decline of about in midjuly nonte spending has been recovering at a faster pace than te categories and our small business customers have been the most resilient through the period weve not seen an increase in our total customer attrition levels from prior years with regards to credit we feel good about our risk management capabilities and the progress weve made with the financial relief programs we rolled out to support our customers as they navigate unexpected financial challenges during these unprecedented times we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage credit risk to achieve the best outcomes for both our customers and our shareholders all in all i feel good about how were managing through this period despite the significant impacts that the covid19 pandemic had on our business we were profitable in the quarter and we have a very strong capital and liquidity position and we paid our dividend to our shareholders importantly our customers continue to be engaged with our products and services and im confident that our strategy of focusing on what we can control in the shortterm while continuing to invest in areas that are key to our growth over the longterm will put us in a position of strength when this crisis ends similar to the first quarter jeff will discuss how the current climate is affecting various elements of our financial results and ill give a little more color on what were doing to manage the company through the present crisis while positioning ourselves to take advantage of the growth opportunities ahead as a reminder in  we introduced four key priorities for supporting our colleagues and winning as a team protecting our customers and our brand structuring the company for growth in the future and staying financially strong we made good progress against this framework and well continue to use it as a guide through the rest of the year ill go through each of these priorities and give you some highlights of our progress in terms of our first priority supporting our colleagues and winning as a team weve been operating on a fully remote basis globally since midmarch our frontline colleagues have continued to deliver outstanding customer service and our historically strong customer satisfaction levels have improved globally on a yearoveryear basis american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 more recently like many other global companies were taking a slow and cautious approach to returning to our offices and were implementing comprehensive safety protocols as our buildings reopen i also want to spend a minute talking about the recent incidents of deadly violence against the black community and the subsequent demands for actions to combat systematic racism like many others were taking a hard look at our own practices across our business and developing a comprehensive plan to strengthen diversity and inclusion within the company while also increasing our support to blackowned businesses and the black community outside of american express as a first step we made million in grants in to several non profits that support the black community and as part of our recentlylaunched shop small initiative we pledged million over the next four years to fund a coalition with the us chamber of commerce foundation bringing together the us black chambers to provide grants to blackowned small businesses we view this as just the beginning of a multifaceted multiyear commitment to do our part to address issues of inequality and to promote social justice our next priority is protecting our customers and our brand to ensure our future success its critical that we continue providing a reliable worldclass experience to help our customers manage through these extraordinary times in recognition of our customers evolving needs in this environment weve enhanced our value propositions on many of our consumer and small business products including adjusting our rewards programs and added limitedtime offers and statement credits in categories that are relevant for today such as wireless grocery streaming services business essentials and food delivery early results from these enhancements are encouraging as i mentioned we havent seen an increase in total customer attrition levels over prior years in addition were seeing increased card member engagement in several of the new categories where weve added value including streaming and wireless services were also building on our commitment to help small businesses around the world as they struggle to recover from the covid19 pandemic last month we announced our largestever global shop small campaign which includes a commitment of over million over the next three months to help jumpstart spending at small merchants in over a dozen countries globally finally weve had very good results in helping our customers who have required financial assistance during the pandemic nearly threequarters of those in our shortterm pandemic relief programs have successfully exited the program and are now current and paying their bills many of those needing more time have chosen to enter one of our enhanced longerterm relief programs which provide additional flexibility in paying balances over time these longerterm programs are now operating in countries around the world our third priority is to structure the company for growth in the future covid19 has had a major impact on the way we live and work and some of the changes may last for some time if not permanently as we begin to see what shape the new normal will take our focus remains on our customers as we look to deepen our relationships and take advantage of the opportunities that will help us grow our customer base going forward in our consumer business well continue to enhance our value propositions to offer features benefits and experiences that are particularly relevant to our customers changing needs im not going to go into specifics now but you will see us continue to refresh our current products and launch new ones focusing on categories that build upon and add to our traditional te offers on the commercial side were seeing a significant increase in demand for our automated b2b payment solutions as more customers look for efficient secure ways to pay suppliers and manage their businesses remotely in this environment we continue to introduce a range of new b2b payment solutions for businesses of all sizes such as last weeks launch of american express one ap for middlemarket companies our first proprietary accounts american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 payable automation offering which is built on a technology of last years acompay acquisition going forward we expect to see the trend towards digitizing the b2b payments process to continue and we will continue to invest in these capabilities for our merchant partners were helping to meet their growing desire along with consumers for clean payments by raising our contactless transaction thresholds in countries around the world throughout this period were continuing to look for more ways to embed american express into our customers digital lives to facilitate the increasing number of online transactions earlier this month we announced along with other major payment networks that well begin technical preparations for the international expansion of click to pay a simple and secure digital checkout solution we also continue to look for opportunities to extend our mutually beneficial strategic partnerships such as the renewal of our longstanding relationship with british airways that was announced this morning as well as the extension of our agreement with marriott during the second quarter turning to internal changes we expect to see an increase in the number of colleagues working from home going forward which will influence how much real estate we need over the longer term in the second quarter we made decisions to accelerate the exit of surplus office space in several countries and were assessing our longterm real estate strategy for a postcovid world finally as im sure you all saw we recently announced that american express became the first foreign payments network to be licensed to clear local currency transactions in mainland china this historic milestone is many years in the making and represents an important step forward in our longterm growth strategy as well as in the overall development of the payments industry in china our fourth priority is to remain financially strong during the second quarter we substantially increased our liquidity to record levels and we further strengthened our capital position with capital ratios that are well above our targets and regulatory requirements these robust capital and liquidity levels will enable us to continue operating through this uncertain period from a position of strength looking ahead no one can tell how the covid19 pandemic will evolve or what its impacts will be on the global economy so we will continue to focus on what we can control backing our customers colleagues and communities maintaining a tight rein on expenses while seizing opportunities to invest in initiatives that will enable our longterm growth and remaining very transparent with all of our key constituents about the trends were seeing and how they are affecting our business thats a quick roundup of the progress weve made on the four priorities i laid out last quarter these last few months have been extremely difficult for everyone and i anticipate well continue to face great challenges and uncertainty in the days ahead while we cant predict the future i feel good about how we are managing through the crisis and i remain confident that we are positioning the company to emerge from this period even stronger this is how we weathered crisis time and time again over our 170year history focusing on what we can control in the shortterm while positioning our company for the longterm and always believing in our customers in the power of our brand and in the resiliency and strength of our people ill now turn it over to jeff jeffrey c campbell executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co well thank you steve and good morning everyone just like i did last quarter im going to talk you through a very different set of slides from what we have used historically in order to help you understand how our business is performing in this unprecedented environment which is obviously unlike any environment any of us have faced historically since the biggest drivers of our financial performance in todays environment are volume and credit trends i will spend most of my time in these two areas american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 lets get right into our summary of financials on slide as you can see our results this quarter were significantly impacted by the global pandemic and the resulting containment measures second quarter revenues of billion were down on an fxadjusted basis driven by declines in spend lend and other travelrelated revenues as a result of covid19 net income was million in the quarter you will notice an unusual effective tax rate this quarter of this is due to the combination of our lower overall pretax income and some sizable discrete items primarily related to certain foreign deferred tax assets that were impacted by the current environment earnings per share was in the second quarter down from a year ago turning to the details of our performance i will note that as was the case on our last earnings call quarterly data just isnt that helpful given the rapidlyevolving environment so well continue to show you our billed business performance and certain other metrics with a bit more granularity on monthly and recent trends lets begin with billed business which you see several different views of on slides through slide shows you that worldwide billed business declines were the most significant down around yearover year in the month of april when the us and most of our largest international markets were effectively shut down due to covid19 since then weve seen steady improvement in essentially all spending trends while certain components of spend are now showing growth our overall billed business volumes remain down yearoveryear given the significant role that te spending has historically played in our business in fact you see on slide that while te spending remains down in the first part of july our nonte billings are actually up about so far in july this difference between the te and nonte billings performance particularly shows when you look at our commercial business where you have the tale of two very different customer types on slide you see that spending from our small and midsized enterprises or sme customers has held up much better through this period than the spending from our large and global corporate card clients the majority of the spend from our sme customers is b2b spending while the spend from our large and global corporate card clients is predominantly te historically i would also remind you here that spending from our sme customers represents the majority of our commercial billed business you also see the impact of different mixes of te spend when you look at our international regions which have a higher mix of te spend and thus are showing larger overall declines in volume as you see on slide now as you would expect we have seen an increasing shift to online and cardnotpresent spending in the current environment this shift is most evident in the consumer business and you can see on the righthand side of slide that for the nonte categories consumer online and cardnotpresent spend is actually up about thus far in july and finally as we all look for signs of where the most recent trends might take us you see some impact from various markets and states going through shifts in the opening of their economies i would say though that these impacts tend to be modest as you see one example of on slide which shows you the latest trends for our four largest states in the us more generally it remains remarkable how much of the world is moving in a fairly similar pattern we are just clearly at a point where theres still uncertainty about where that pattern will go next and at what pace turning next to loans and receivables on slide you see that total loans declined and charge card member receivables declined yearoveryear in the second quarter primarily driven by our lower spending volumes this dynamic of our balance sheet shrinking in weaker economic times is an important aspect of our business model as it fuels the extremely strong liquidity and capital metrics i will discuss later looking forward american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 into the third quarter if you assume some continued modest improvement in spending levels id expect the sequential trend in our balances to be fairly stable moving on to slide loan and receivable writeoffs excluding gcp these things grew just in the second quarter and clearly do not yet reflect incremental stress since not enough time has passed for the impacts of the current environment to flow through our traditional writeoff credit metrics it is worth noting that our delinquency dollars are actually down yearoveryear you do see an increase in writeoff and delinquency rates yearover year but this is primarily due to the significantly lower loan and receivable balances as opposed to there being any significant change yet in these traditional credit metrics in contrast our provision expense on slide reflects the likely impact on future writeoffs of the current stressed environment as we took an additional credit reserve build of million in the second quarter as you know macroeconomic forecasts are a key factor in determining the credit reserve build under cecl particularly in a volatile environment so turning then to slide you will see the macroeconomic assumptions that were used in our cecl reserving models for the first and second quarter this quarter just like last quarter you had a worsening macro environment however this quarter there was an offsetting benefit mainly from volume declines as you can see on slide we ended the second quarter with billion of credit reserves roughly billion higher than the reserve level we had on our balance sheet after we implemented cecl at the beginning of  the increase is from a combination of the billion of credit reserves we added at the end of the first quarter as a result of the worsening economic outlook due to covid19 as well as the million reserve build we took in the second quarter today our lending and charge credit reserves on the balance sheet represent of our loan balances and of our card member receivable balances respectively so how do we feel about this level of reserves in todays environment based on what we have learned and seen over the last few months we do feel good about our risk management practices the way we are managing risk through the current environment and the resulting level of reserves we are holding it all starts with the changes we have made over the last few years in our risk management practices which gave us a solid starting position when the pandemic hit we quickly rolled out a new shortterm customer pandemic relief program or cpr offering primarily onemonth payment deferrals which we believe gave us better visibility into our customers situations and then rolled out enhanced longerterm programs for customers that need extended assistance as they exit our cpr program the nature of our charge card products also gives us very realtime visibility into our customers situations and of course like others we are also helped by external factors such as the impact of unprecedented levels of government stimulus and the broad availability of forbearance programs internally one way we track what is actually happening in our portfolio is through looking at the balances that are in delinquent status or in one of our financial relief programs including the temporary cpr program as you can see in the bar on the righthand side of slide the total of these balances was billion at the end of  around billion higher than the bau level we had at the end of last year precovid around the time we reported earnings last quarter this metric was up to a peak of billion as we saw balances enrolled in the customer pandemic relief program peak in midapril since then the majority of customers exiting the cpr program have become current and the remainder either enrolled in one of our longerterm financial relief programs or are in the delinquent bucket today we have stopped enrolling new customers in cpr and only a relatively small balance remains in the program you will find the details of our cpm sic cpr program balances in midapril and at the end of  in the appendix on slide american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 the increase in the longerterm financial relief programs balance over the past quarter reflects the effectiveness of the enhancements we rolled out in april as we continue to work hard alongside our card members to help them identify the right program for them so that they can retain their membership and get to a good financial outcome for both our customers and our shareholders historically weve seen that the credit outcomes of card members that enroll in our financial relief programs are better than those that do not with around of enrolled balances successfully completing these payment plans and when you look at the delinquent and frp balances on our books today coupled with our historical experience with card member payment behavior we believe that the reserves we have on our balance sheet are appropriate based on whats happened so far now only time will tell what the ultimate level of writeoffs will be given the completely unprecedented nature of the global environment but we feel good about our risk management capabilities and the work weve done so far to manage our exposure moving on to revenues on slide revenues declined on an fxadjusted basis in the second quarter as you would expect given the spendcentric nature of our business model revenue declines hit a trough with  in the month of april and showed steady improvement throughout the quarter looking at the details of our revenue performance on slide you see the impact of the continued strong card member engagement that steve discussed in the growth in net card fees despite declines in all of the revenue lines due to the current environment we expect this solid growth to continue with some modest deceleration since we have slowed proactive new card acquisition other fees and commissions and other revenues were down almost yearoveryear due to declines in travel related revenue streams such as fx conversion fees our business travel jv income share and commissions and fees from our consumer travel business these revenue streams are a modest part of our total revenue and typically dont change much quartertoquarter in a bau environment but continue to be down significantly year overyear in the second quarter due to the covid impact on travel turning to the details of net interest income and yield i would move you ahead to slide on the lefthand side you see that net interest yield on our card member loans increased basis points yearoveryear in the second quarter driven primarily by mix benefits due to a faster decline in transactor loans relative to revolving loans as well as our ongoing efforts to effectively price for risk moving to the right net interest income declined on an fxadjusted basis which was less than the loan declines we saw in the second quarter due to the yield benefits i just spoke about our largest component of revenue discount revenue declined in the second quarter as you can see on slide as expected the contraction in discount revenue was larger than the decline in billed business due to the much larger declines we saw in higher discount rate te spend versus lower discount rate nonte spend in the second quarter the divergence in te and nonte billing trends drove a 14basis point decline in the average discount rate in the second quarter relative to the prior year looking forward if te spending remains suppressed we would expect a similar level of discount rate erosion in the third quarter moving on to expenses on slide we are continuing to break out our expenses between variable customer engagement expenses which come down naturally as spend declines and benefits usage changes and marketing and opex which are driven by management decisions variable customer engagement expenses were down yearoveryear driven by lower spend and lower usage of travelrelated benefits the yearoveryear decline in variable customer engagement expenses provided roughly a offset to the revenue decline in the second quarter a bit more than i would expect to see going forward american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 moving on to marketing and opex as we mentioned in our  earnings call we made the decision back in march to aggressively reduce costs across the enterprise for the balance of the year but also to reinvest a portion of those savings in our existing customer base as a result weve dramatically reduced our proactive marketing efforts for new card acquisition and reinvested in value proposition enhancements resulting in a decline in marketing expenses in the second quarter this outcome is a good example of what weve long said about the flexibility we have around our marketing investment levels which can be pulled back as well as redeployed quickly if market conditions and the universe of attractive opportunities change operating expenses were down year overyear in the second quarter and we are on track to achieve our target of a billion opex reduction year overyear cumulatively across  through  moving last to capital and liquidity on slide our capital and liquidity positions remain tremendously strong and strengthened even further in the second quarter we also saw healthy deposit growth of during the second quarter even as we adjusted pricing given the current rate environment as you can see on slide of the appendix due to the countercyclical nature of our balance sheet our cet1 ratio increased to and our cash and investment balance grew to a record billion in the second quarter we continue to have significant flexibility to maintain a solid balance sheet in periods of uncertainty or stress and with our strong capital position we have the capacity and intend to continue to pay our dividend in the third quarter we continue to have significant flexibility to maintain a strong balance sheet in periods of uncertainty or stress and our strong capital position provides the capacity and we will pay our dividend in the third quarter and intend to pay it beyond subject to our board approval and so long as financial conditions support it in summary no one can know how the future will play out but we feel good about how we are managing the company for the longterm this morning we have been clear about how the current unprecedented times are impacting us financially looking forward we have tremendous capital and liquidity strength the continued engagement of our customers with our brand and were confident that we are focused on the right things to position american express to grow as the current challenges inevitably recede with that ill turn the call back over to vivian vivian y zhou senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co thank you jeff before we open the line for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will open up the line for questions operator american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw go ahead please sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning im glad you guys are doing all right and thank you for the added disclosures in the deck those were great i guess steve you pointed out that conditions are a little bit clearer now versus last quarter so im curious what your views are on te and the size of the market and if your views have changed in terms of there being any structural impact to the market and then how can we think about american express responding to that longterm is b2b a realistic solution over the intermediate term thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good to hear from you sanjay let me provide a little context first and then sort of answer the question so when you look at our overall spending of our spending before this crisis was nonte and growing faster than our te business and was te to drill down a little bit our corporate card business was of our overall business with about to of that being te and not growing all that quickly and then you look at our sme business which has been the most resilient at this particular point in time and that business makes up of our commercial business overall and is doing quite well and probably close to of that spend is nonte so when we look at whats going on right now and we gave you obviously disclosure up till almost sort of mid july we see growth in nonte but we see te as still being slow were seeing restaurants come back obviously faster than you see airlines or hotels coming back but i also think what youre seeing is theres an unbelievable demand for people to travel it may not be the same types of travel but you are seeing people driving to different locations and albeit when they come back quarantining but they are driving to different locations and so were seeing obviously a little bit of an uptick in some of our lodging which would include airbnb as well and other entities like that but i think as we think about this longerterm and you only have to look at what the airline executives said over the last week or so i think my view has not changed on corporate travel i think corporate travel will take a while to come back but eventually well get back to levels you just wont have all that growth that was happening in between i think the demand for consumer travel once consumers feel safe again you will have this unbelievable pentup demand for people to want to get out and travel in fact our cobrand cards in our consumer business are actually performing better than some of our proprietary cards now that may seem counterintuitive but when you look at our partnerships with delta hilton ba and so forth these cards are performing better why are they performing better well theyre performing better because of the spending is not on the cobrand partner of the spending these are not store cards these are allpurpose cards and a lot of people their psychology is they save points for the big trip the other part of the psychology is i want status and i can get status through spending and i think when this is over status is going to be even more important as we move forward so i dont think from a timing perspective my view has changed i think that will be driven by therapeutics itll be driven by vaccine itll be driven by the distribution and production of vaccines but i think that as we look at our spending we anticipate a slow climb back and were seeing our consumers by definition consumers consume and there is a pentup demand to consume and they will find other ways to consume as we are seeing american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 from a value proposition perspective because im sure thats where people will go next from a value proposition perspective part of our dna has always been to constantly refresh our value propositions and as weve talked about weve been talking about refreshing those value propositions from a lifestyle perspective and so while not getting into specific details on value propositions for competitive reasons what weve done in the shortterm is some stopgap measures in terms of various credits and extension of benefits and things like that which are doing two things number one showing our customers were thinking about them but number two is actually getting more engagements in categories that we didnt have as much engagement in we increased our engagement in wireless and we increased our engagement in streaming but you will see us continue to morph our value propositions into next year by adding on to our premium value propositions with more lifestyle nonte aspects and developing other value propositions for other products and services so i hope i gave you sort of a general view of how were thinking about things operator well go next to the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley go ahead please betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning my question is stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hi betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to understand a little bit on the credit side and the reserving that you did i know you indicated that you feel like youre in a good place and so when i think about the reserving levels im looking at the billion versus roughly the billion in the delinquency and financial relief programs that youve got so is that how i should be thinking about the forward look as these financial relief programs either increase or decrease the reserve will flex around that and maybe you can give us a sense as to how youre seeing those reserve buckets between consumer and small business because theres been a lot of questions around the small business exposure and risk that youve got thank you jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co yeah two good questions betsy i guess the numbers i would actually encourage people to think about are since the beginning of the crisis between last quarter and this quarter weve added billion billion of american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 reserves and of course that is based upon cecl accounting which is really about a forecast of the future and that forecast of the future i would tell you well we dont do our own economic forecasts the external provider that we use does incorporate into their forecast such things as government aid running out such things as perhaps more small business failures andor layoffs so that all goes into that billion to billion cecl reserve build as a forecast the reason we added slide which is something we really closely monitor internally betsy is because its fact its not a forecast it shows you the actual experience that we have had through the end of june and the number i would actually encourage you to look at on slide is the difference between the total dollars we had that were delinquent or in a financial relief program before covid19 the difference between that number and the end of july was billion and very importantly i pointed it out in my script our historical experience is that with people we get into one of our longer financial relief programs we generally over time are able to manage to get about of those balances so we look at these numbers and say boy we feel good about our credit reserves we think theyre certainly appropriate i would point out depending on what your future view is of the economy betsy if you think theres going to be several more shocks government aid running out then we will need all those reserves on the other hand i think what slide would say if those shocks dont occur we may not need all those reserves well have to see the last thing id say is if you go back days this is to your second part of your question betsy initially there were a higher percentage of the dollars that were in the small business receivable and loan receivable balances that signed up for cpr than there were consumer days on now we actually feel really good about the small business portfolio and in fact those numbers have come way down and i think its important to remember and steve you might want to talk for a second about this i think people sometimes forget they look at our small business segment and they think oh my gosh thats restaurants and some of the harderhit sectors thats not actually who our small business card members are stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so just the other point of that question is theres in that frp program as jeff said historically wind up paying us and when they do that now theyll get their membership back and what have you but out of that theres more consumer in frp right now than there is in small business but i think whats really important about small business youve got to look at the merchant business and youve got to look at the small business card business theyre two completely different businesses and while we have a huge preponderance of the restaurants across the world and particularly in the united states from a merchant acceptance perspective only of our small business customers are actually restaurants the concentration of our small business portfolio is professional services legal finance insurance real estate about construction about and healthcare about so when you think about small businesses theres a wide variety of small businesses and i think we tend to think about small businesses as the restaurant and the local retail shop we dont tend to think about small businesses from a professional perspective and theres a lot of people getting a lot of things done in their homes because theyre not going anywhere at this particular point in time so were seeing good activity in those segments so i think thats an important distinction between what our merchant base looks like and what our small business card base looks like operator our next question will come from the line of mihir bhatia with bank of america go ahead please american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning thanks for taking my question i wanted to jeff i share your comments on the discount fees remaining strong at least here in the nearterm but your proprietary cardsinforce did decline for the first time in quite a while so i was curious is that just driven by slower acquisitions and if you could maybe just provide some more color on just what youre seeing in terms of attrition trends and what youre doing to drive retention in this current backdrop thank you jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co well so maybe a couple of points first id just remind everyone the context here is that for a couple years the fastestgrowing part of our revenue line by far has been net card fees we feel really good about the level of card member engagements that that represents and even this quarter in the face of all the challenges that line grew thats point one point two as steve pointed out when you look at our overall attrition levels they have not gone up at all and are flat to down to where they were a year ago which we think is a really strong statement about the continued engagement of our card members what we did do is that we slowed our proactive acquisition because theres just not enough visibility into the actual credit quality of applicants so you saw our new cards acquired which is also disclosed in parts of the press tables were down significantly yearoveryear the other thing you would expect us to be doing from a risk management perspective is we have been very diligent about looking at people who are inactive card members and canceling those cards you dont want to have inactive cards sitting out there in the middle of a economic downturn so really that combination of slower new card member acquisition along with some of the inactive cancellations that were doing are why when you look at that total card number you see the numbers you do but we feel really good about our attrition levels we feel really good about our card member and id expect to see net card fees continue to grow in the double digits stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah i mean the most important thing so if you look at exactly the number you looked at thats what you see the most important thing for me in looking at the business is voluntary attrition and voluntary attrition levels are down yearoveryear and from an acquisition perspective you dont want to be the spender or borrower here of last resort and so we have been very very circumspect about how we keep the channels going and what have you and who we take in and who we dont take in but what weve done is weve kept our channels open because youve got to keep those channels open because you want to be able to turn them on at the appropriate time there will be a pentup demand and i dont want to have to sort of regen all the channels that we have but the thing that i look at on a weekly basis and we look at this by card level and card type but im not going to get into it with you but the reality is in managing the business i look at voluntary attrition and that is down and of course in a situation like were in now where over time weve been feeding the card acquisition machine you dont feed it to the same extent that weve been feeding it and so it is down significantly which is why youre seeing the marketing expense go down which is why youve seen us pivot our marketing investment from card acquisition to card member value and card member engagement so im not concerned at all about the proprietary card numbers those numbers will come back up as we turn acquisition back on but what i do watch very carefully is the voluntary attrition numbers and jeffs point is right i mean we will cancel people because you do not want contingent liability out there in the environment if they hadnt been using you before more than likely you dont want them to be using you now american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 operator well go next to chris donat with piper sandler go ahead please christopher donat q analyst piper sandler co good morning thanks for taking my question wanted to ask about the impact of bankruptcies on your financial statements weve seen some corporate issuers and theyll identify american express as a creditor and we did see in the variance analysis in the presentation that you had a million writeoff for receivables for a corporate client so jeff can you just remind us sort of how those flow like in terms of recoveries do they show up in different places in the income statement and how do they typically play out jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co yeah so chris the kinds of losses youre mostly referring to which are when a merchant goes out of business in a situation where either the merchant owes us money or were going to make good on certain card members who didnt get their goods or services delivered those are generally not going to appear as part of the credit provision theyre generally going to appear in opex historically that number has been completely insignificant weve taken some modest i guess in the tens of millions of dollars charges the last two quarters we manage it very closely the one larger number you talked about if you and very quick reading on your part to get to the variance explanation you would also note that due to a little bit of a quirk in accounting yes we had a million loss with an international merchant on the other hand thats actually a merchant where we had some credit insurance so we would expect to more or less fully recover that loss it appears on a different line item in the pl so thats all carefully footnoted there in the appendix so look we work closely with all of our merchants we watch this very carefully but historically these just arent big numbers for us operator well go next to the line of craig sic eric wasserstrom with ubs go ahead eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc hi thank you its eric wasserstrom one question steve it was interesting of course to see the renewal with that you announced today generally speaking as youre approaching these cobrand renewals how and to what extent are the current trends influencing how these deals are being struck if at all differently from the past stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so look weve done in the quarter we did a renewal and an extension we extended our marriott agreement early in the quarter and today we announced the renewal to of british airways so let me just give you the context on how i think about these things if i was thinking about these renewals for a to 24month period i wouldnt do them but im thinking about this business for the longterm and in the longterm these have been terrific partners british airways has been a terrific partner of ours for over years marriott has been a partner of ours as they did the starwood acquisition we had starwood for a number of years and were very happy about that relationship and the reality is is that this pandemic will end and as i mentioned earlier when i look at the delta and i look at the hilton card these are cards that are actually performing even better than some of our proprietary cards and the reason for that is you have two great brands together with great value propositions so as we think about these renewals we think about them over the longterm we dont think about them just at a shortterm period american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 and you see that in both of these renewals there were upfront purchases of points and thats in a way for us to help out our partners but also to help out our shareholders as well so these are again longterm partnerships that have tremendous value and we look at them over the life of these deals and over the life of these deals these would be good things for our shareholders and good things for our customers and so thats why we extended both of these deals at this particular point in time operator our next question will come from david togut with evercore isi go ahead please david mark togut q analyst evercore isi thank you good morning steve youve highlighted the surge for more kind of cardholder value in your comments and weve seen from most of the cardissuing banks the second quarter reports and even in the visa and mastercard intraquarter updates the strength in debit and im wondering whether this isnt a time for american express to introduce a debit card to the extent were in a multiyear search for value here a tough economy doesnt that play to the consumer value proposition that could be with us for a while stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co its something that we look at on an ongoing basis economics are a little bit different in debit and the value that youre able to put on a debit card given the economics are a little bit different but we continue to look at ways to fully service our customers not only from a lending perspective but a transaction spending perspective as well so its something that well continue to look at and if in fact we believe it will add more value then we will look to proceed it was part of why we did our deal with paypal to link venmo in we felt that while we didnt need our own debit product the ability to have the transfer from venmo to american express and vice versa was good and look as we launch china that will be both a debit and a credit market for us so its something that we constantly look at and as you can see therell be two sort of flavors of that while not having our ownissued debit card at this particular point in time operator our next question will be from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer go ahead dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc thanks so much for taking my questions as you guys look at your billed business growth numbers versus the peer data i think some of the spend growth trends reflect the prudence of your customer base to dial back perhaps some of their discretionary spending can you just talk about some of the green shoots if any as to where your customer base has been diverting their spending from travel to other categories and how that spending behavior may have changed on a temporary basis versus more permanent thanks so much stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah look i think that our spending base has been traditionally from a consumer perspective more highend consumer more discretionary spending more luxury spending over the last couple of months its been hard to do that it has been hard to take those trips it has been hard to even go shopping for luxury goods weve seen more online spending obviously people are eating out less and theyre buying more groceries and what have you but we believe there is a pentup demand within our consumer base to spend i think what youre also seeing american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 is lots of spending from our perspective in sort of home improvement area with people like lowes and home depot and things like that where our card members are spending the other piece of our overall spending really is as you think about our corporate spending our corporate spending is down by and thats traditionally the te piece the b2b piece is still relatively strong so i think while we look at it we havent really seen our consumers really break out a lot of their spending at this point which from my perspective is not necessarily a bad thing because number one it gives us more opportunity sort of down the road and were more than holding our own obviously from a financial perspective both credit and profitability and from a card value perspective with what theyre doing but i think time will tell if there are permanent shifts in spending but i think that as i said before our consumers like to consume and they will find other ways to spend and theyll find ways to get more luxury goods and things like that operator well go to the line of mark devries from barclays go ahead mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks and sorry if you covered this in the prepared comments but normally card member rewards kind of move with billed business but this quarter it was down a lot more was that a product of just lower spend in te which has higher rewards attachment or is there something you did actively there to manage that expense and also if revenues remain weak for a prolonged period of time are there other things youre looking to do to lower expenses jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co yeah so actually mark youre sort of deadon normally people should expect rewards to move roughly in line with billings this quarter it went down more and that was driven by the fact that youre correct the higher cost redemptions are the redemptions that people do for travelrelated rewards one of the shifts just like spend as steve was just talking about has shifted a little bit from travel into other types of spending well we still have rewards shifted from the highercost travel to other things particularly some of the online things we do with some of our partners and so thats why for this quarter you saw rewards come down a little faster than just the billings i dont know that id i think that trend may have played itself out well have to see stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co the other thing that we did about a year ago is we did a deal with paypal to be able to burn points at every paypal merchant in the united states and so we were starting to see paypal kick up and it was all about providing our card members with more and more options for rewards and so again is that a permanent trend no but i think we were starting to see that so i think well have a little bit more balance and redemption going forward as well operator well go next to the line of craig maurer with autonomous go ahead craig maurer q analyst autonomous research us lp yeah good morning american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hey craig craig maurer q analyst autonomous research us lp how are you guys stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good how are you craig craig maurer q analyst autonomous research us lp great thank you i wanted to go back to sanjays comment and ask that you retain these disclosures after the pandemic but just a suggestion i wanted to ask if youre seeing any im trying to think through what retailers are doing now in response to whats going on this seems like this might be a onceinalifetime opportunity for retailers to disintermediate their highest cost cards meaning travelbased rewards programs and try to permanently push a narrative away from that how are you thinking about that how are you reacting to that and are you hearing any discussions of that from executives and then just a numbers question for jeff jeff what was the reserve coverage in the sme portfolio thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so craig i havent heard any of that i think right now retailers restaurants and anybody else is trying to welcome people with open arms now is not the time to be aggravating your customers in any way shape or form and i think when customers are coming in to establishments they go there with the intent to not only support the establishment but to have a good time and im not so sure they really want to be badgered or suppressed or anything else i dont see that i have not seen that i havent heard that i havent heard that from other card executives and i certainly havent seen that within our own portfolios the other thing i would say is that im not seeing a big push on store cards right now either which is probably not the most creditworthy segment so i havent seen it but craig were always looking for that and thats why were always trying to deliver value on both sides of the equation by driving in highspending customers and i just think at this time its foolhearted for a merchant to sort of give their customer any reason to not want to come back to the store so havent seen it at all jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co and craig in response to your second question as i said in my remarks overall you had of our card member loan balances reserved and about a little more than on the card member receivable side and clearly reflecting something else i said earlier one of the things that has pleased us in the last days is that when you look at the reserve percentage on the loan side which is where most of the exposure is its actually lower for sme its at than it is for consumer which is a little bit above american express co axp corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2020 stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co days ago to be honest it was not clear to us thats where the trend was going to go but that makes us feel pretty good on the receivable side on both the sme and consumer side its around stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah just one other point on that there was early on coming out of the pandemic you saw a group of merchants that were adding on sort of regardless of how you paid it anywhere from a to covid surcharge they were actually calling it a covid surcharge they got ripped in the press and they got ripped by their customers if your costs are going up raise your costs but dont surprise somebody at the end so i think people right now are just happy with people coming in to their store albeit what that means coming in to a store these days whether youre eating out in the street or you sort of drive by pickup for shopping so i just dont see that happening in the short to mediumterm operator our final question will come from don fandetti with wells fargo go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks so jeff in terms of the state disclosure and you think about consumer te how impactful is sort of your top one or two markets new york or california if we see one of those open up or slow down just to get a sensitivity of what that could do to te jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co well so youre correct the states we chose to show in the slides are our four largest states texas florida new york and california i dont think weve given the exact numbers don in a while by state id kind of step way back remember were a global company the us is only twothirds of the business to begin with and of course we are spread across all states so no one state opening or closing at various levels is going to have a material impact on our trends the other point i will come back to don that i do think is not completely intuitive to people is when you look at the varying rates states have opened up theres a little bit of difference between states if you look at that chart theres new york new york is still down a little bit more than in texas or florida but its a pretty modest difference so the most important thing is more where is the overall global economy going at what rate do we make some real medical strides here and our business will respond vivian y zhou senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co with that we will bring the call to an end thank you steve thank you
