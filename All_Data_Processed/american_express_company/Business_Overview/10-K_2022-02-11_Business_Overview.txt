financing solutions the payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies consumer habits and merchant needs some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic such as an increased shift to ecommerce and demand for contactless payments as a card issuer we compete with financial institutions that issue generalpurpose credit and debit cards we also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards operate mobile wallets or extend credit we face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted highspending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions we also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings such as lounge space in us and global hub airports our global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks including among others china unionpay visa

mastercard in addition to such networks a range of companies globally including merchant acquirers processors and web and mobilebased payment platforms eg alipay paypal and venmo as well as regional payment networks such as the national payments corporation of india carry out some activities similar to those performed by our gmns business the principal competitive factors that affect the

high regulatory expectations a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governmental authorities have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations and as a result we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures reviews by us and governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies including errors or misconduct by colleagues or third parties or control failures have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination we have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations external publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of those investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries in addition legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the offering of consumer financial products and the operation of payment networks resulting in changes to certain practices or pricing of card

activities as noted above each of the company and trs is a bank holding company and each has elected to become a financial holding company which is authorized to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities in order to remain eligible for financial holding company status we must meet certain eligibility requirements those requirements include that each of the company and aenb must

in various activities permissible only for financial holding companies including in particular providing travel agency services acting as a finder and engaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency services if the company fails to meet eligibility requirements for financial holding company status it and its subsidiaries are likely to be barred from engaging in new types of financial activities or making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance on its status as a financial holding company and ultimately could be required to either discontinue the broader range of activities permitted to financial holding companies or divest aenb in addition the company and its subsidiaries are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that the relevant regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound which such authorities generally interpret broadly table of contents acquisitions and investments applicable federal and state laws place limitations on the ability of persons to invest in or acquire control of us without providing notice to or obtaining the approval of one or more of our regulators in addition we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit our investments and acquisitions and in some cases subject them to the prior review and approval of our regulators including the federal reserve and the occ federal banking regulators have broad discretion in evaluating proposed acquisitions and investments that are subject to their prior review or approval financial regulatory reform the company is subject to the us federal bank regulatory agencies rules that tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions with billion or more in total consolidated assets under these rules each bank holding company as well as its bank subsidiaries is assigned to one of four categories based on its status as a us global systemically important banking organization and five other riskbased indicators i total assets ii crossjurisdictional activity iii nonbank assets iv offbalance sheet exposure and v weighted shortterm wholesale funding under these rules the company and its depository institution subsidiary aenb is subject to category iv standards because a firms categorization is determined by and can change over time dependent upon how the firm measures against the riskbased indicator thresholds we are required to monitor and periodically report these riskbased indicators and there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be a category iv firm in the future capital and liquidity regulation capital rules the company and aenb are required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy rules established by federal banking regulators these rules are intended to ensure that bank holding companies and depository institutions collectively banking organizations have adequate capital given their level of assets and offbalance sheet obligations the federal

minimum ratios for common equity tier cet1 capital tier capital that is cet1 capital plus additional tier capital and total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets we report our capital adequacy ratios using riskweighted assets calculated under the standardized approach as a category iv firm we are not subject to the advanced approaches capital requirements in december the basel committee published standards that among other things revise the standardized approach for credit risk including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing additional capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card lines of credit and provide a new standardized calculation for operational risk capital requirements if adopted in the united states as issued by the basel committee and applicable to us the new standards are likely to result in higher capital requirements for us in december federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an optional threeyear phasein period for the adverse regulatory capital effects of adopting the current expected credit loss cecl methodology pursuant to new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on certain financial instruments which became effective january in august federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an option to delay the estimated impact of the adoption of the cecl methodology on regulatory capital for up to two years followed by the threeyear phasein period we elected to adopt the twoyear delay followed by the threeyear phasein period therefore the company began phasing in the cumulative amount that is not recognized in regulatory capital at percent per year beginning january see critical accounting estimates under mda for additional information on cecl table of contents the company and aenb must each maintain cet1 capital tier capital and total capital ratios of at least percent

severely adverse scenario under the federal reserves stress tests described below plus ii one year of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of riskweighted assets on june the federal reserve

company is required to participate in the supervisory stress tests every other year and is subject to the federal reserves supervisory stress tests in the company is required to develop and submit to the federal reserve an annual capital plan on or before april of each year for category iv firms such as the company the portion of the scb based on the federal reserves supervisory stress tests is calculated every other year during a year in which a category iv firm does not undergo a supervisory stress test the firm receives an updated scb that reflects the firms updated planned common stock dividends a category iv firm can elect to participate in the supervisory stress test in an off year and consequently receive an updated scb table of contents due to the economic uncertainty related to the pandemic the federal reserve prohibited share repurchases in the third and fourth quarters of for all bank holding companies participating in ccar but a llowed them to pay common stock dividends provided a they did not increase the amount of the dividend and b the dividends did not exceed the average of a firms net income for the four preceding calendar quarters during the first and second

above the company will be subject to limitations and restrictions on capital distributions if among other things i the companys regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or ii the company is required to resubmit its capital plan in general federal laws and regulations prohibit without first obtaining the occs approval aenb from making dividend distributions to trs if such distributions are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause aenb to fail to meet capital adequacy standards in addition to specific limitations on the dividends aenb can pay to trs federal banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of a dividend if in the banking regulators opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the institution prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance act fdia requires among other things that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions insured by the fdic such as aenb that do not meet minimum capital requirements the fdia establishes five capital categories for fdicinsured banks well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized the fdia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified in order to be considered well capitalized aenb must maintain

deposits raised through thirdparty brokerage networks or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is well capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic a portion of our outstanding us retail deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes if a federal regulator determines that we are in an unsafe or unsound condition or that we are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices the regulator may reclassify our capital category or otherwise place restrictions on our ability to accept or solicit brokered deposits in december the fdic issued a final rule intended to update and modernize the fdics brokered deposit regulations effective april the final rule among other things expanded the definition of deposit broker and updated the interest rate restrictions for less than

aenb continues to be required to prepare and provide a separate resolution plan to the fdic that would enable the fdic as receiver to effectively resolve aenb under the fdia in the event of failure the fdic issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on potential revisions to this separate resolution plan requirement for insured depository institutions in april and temporarily suspended resolution planning requirements for insured depository institutions in january the fdic lifted the moratorium on resolution plan submissions for insured depository institutions with billion or more in assets including aenb on june the fdic released a statement outlining a modified approach to implementing the fdics rule requiring insured depository institutions with billion or more in total assets to submit resolution plans among other things the modified approach i extends the resolution plans submission frequency to a threeyear cycle ii lays out new details regarding the fdics emphasis on engagement with firms and iii exempts filers from other content requirements that the fdic has determined have been less useful or are obtainable through other supervisory channels orderly

systemically important financial institution if the company is in danger of default and is determined to present a systemic risk to us financial stability as under the fdic resolution model under the ola the fdic has broad power as receiver substantial differences exist however between the ola and the fdic resolution model for depository institutions including the right of the fdic under the ola to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in limited circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditor claims as opposed to the judicial procedure used in bankruptcy proceedings and the right of the fdic to transfer claims to a bridge entity the fdic has developed a strategy under ola referred to as the single point of entry or spoe strategy under which the fdic would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets including shares of its operating subsidiaries and potentially very limited liabilities to a bridge holding company utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company under this strategy management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and its shareholders and creditors would bear the losses resulting from the failure fdic powers upon insolvency of aenb if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of aenb the fdic has the power to transfer any of aenbs assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of aenbs creditors to enforce the terms of aenbs contracts pursuant to their terms or to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which aenb is a party the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of aenb in addition the claims of holders of us deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic against aenb would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against aenb including claims of debt holders and depositors in nonus offices in the liquidation or other resolution of aenb as a result whether or not the fdic ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of aenb the debt holders and depositors in nonus offices would be treated differently from and could receive substantially less if anything than the depositors in the us offices of aenb table of contents other banking regulations source of strength the company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its us bank subsidiary aenb and may be required to commit capital and financial resources to support aenb such support may be required at times when absent this requirement the company otherwise might determine not to provide it capital loans by the company to aenb are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of aenb in the event of the companys bankruptcy any commitment by the company to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of aenb will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment transactions between aenb and its affiliates certain transactions including loans and credit extensions from aenb between aenb and its affiliates including the company trs and their other subsidiaries are subject to quantitative and qualitative limitations collateral requirements and other restrictions imposed by statute and regulation transactions subject to these restrictions are generally required to be made on an armslength basis fdic deposit insurance and insurance assessments aenb accepts deposits that are insured by the fdic up to the applicable limits under the fdia the fdic may terminate the insurance of an institutions deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the fdic we do not know of any practice condition or violation that would lead to termination of deposit insurance at aenb the fdics deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions including aenb which are subject to adjustment by the fdic community reinvestment act aenb is subject to the cra which imposes affirmative ongoing obligations on depository institutions to meet the credit needs of their local communities including low and moderateincome neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution in may the occ issued a final rule intended to i clarify which activities qualify for cra credit ii update where activities count for cra credit and iii change the methods for cra measurement data collection recordkeeping and reporting for national banks and federal savings associations effective january that final rule was rescinded and replaced with a rule based on the rules adopted jointly by the federal banking agencies in as amended this action was intended to promote consistency for all insured depository institutions while the agencies continue their ongoing work to modernize the cra framework on an interagency basis climate risk management the us banking agencies steadily increased their focus on climate riskrelated supervision during and are expected to expand and formalize that focus in for example on october the financial stability oversight council fsoc issued its report on climaterelated financial risk which contains recommendations for fsocs member agencies and serves as a framework for next steps in addition on december the occ issued for public comment a set of proposed principles for climaterelated financial risk management for large banks the principles would apply to occregulated institutions with more than billion in total consolidated assets like aenb and are broadly designed to provide a highlevel framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climaterelated financial risks consistent with existing occ rules and guidance the principles outline six key aspects of climaterelated financial risk management governance policies procedures and limits strategic planning risk management data risk measurement and reporting and scenario analysis in addition the principles offer risk assessment guidance for incorporating climaterelated financial risks in various traditional risk categories it is too early to determine what regulations and policies may be adopted or apply to the company and aenb and the effect of any such regulations or policies on the company and aenb table of contents consumer financial products regulation in the united states our marketing sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the cfpb which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices the cfpb has the authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws to enforce those laws and to examine for compliance it is also authorized to collect fines and require consumer restitution in the event of violations engage in consumer financial education track consumer complaints request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities in addition a number of us states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than us federal laws us federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny on november the cfpbs final rule that sets forth additional requirements for thirdparty debt collection agencies which we use in the ordinary course of business became effective see we are exposed to credit risk and trends that affect card member spending and the ability of customers and partners to pay us which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition under risk factors for potential impacts related to legal and regulatory changes on our ability to collect amounts owed to us we are also regulated in the united states under the money transmitter or sale of check laws in effect in most states in addition we are required by the laws of many states to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property laws under which we must pay to states the face amount of any travelers cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period of time depending on the type of product additionally we are regulated under insurance laws in the united states and other countries where we offer insurance services in countries outside the united states regulators continue to focus on a number of key areas impacting our cardissuing businesses particularly consumer protection such as in the european union eu the united kingdom and canada and responsible lending such as in australia mexico new zealand and singapore with increasing importance on and attention to customers and outcomes rather than just ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations regulators expectations of firms in relation to their compliance risk and control frameworks continue to increase and regulators are placing significant emphasis on a firms systems and controls relating to the identification and resolution of issues payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through enforcement actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the eu australia canada and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants and we have exited our network businesses in the eu and australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions for example there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the eu and uk payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the eu and the uk given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements we are subject to regulatory action penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the eu or the uk in various countries such as certain member states in the eu and australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally our card members or our business in addition other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on us see surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations under risk factors table of contents in some countries governments have established regulatory regimes that require international card networks to be locally licensed andor to localize aspects of their operations for example the reserve bank of india which has broad power under the payment and settlement systems act to regulate the membership and operations of card networks has issued a mandate requiring payment systems operators in india to store certain payments data locally on april the reserve bank of india imposed restrictions on the ability of american express banking corp to engage in certain card issuing activities in india from may until it complies with a regulation requiring storage of payment transaction data exclusively in india this order does not impact existing customers we are working towards complying with the regulation governments in some countries also provide resources or protection to select domestic payment card networks the development and enforcement of these and other similar laws regulations and policies may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network privacy data protection data governance information and cyber security regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy data protection data governance and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide we have established and continue to maintain policies and a governance framework to comply with applicable privacy data protection data governance and

ensuring that our privacy data protection data governance and information and cyber securityrelated policies and practices are adequate to inform customers of our data collection use sharing andor security practices to provide them with choices if required about how we use and share their information and to appropriately safeguard their personal information and account access regulators are also focused on data management data governance and our thirdparty risk management policies and practices in the united states certain of our businesses are subject to the privacy disclosure and safeguarding provisions of the grammleachbliley act glba and its implementing regulations and guidance among other things glba imposes certain limitations on our ability to share consumers nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties and requires us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the size and complexity of our business the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of customer information that we process more recently we have expanded privacy rights to california residents who are not covered by glba pursuant to the california consumer privacy act and the california privacy rights act various regulators us states and territories are considering similar requirements or have adopted laws rules and regulations pertaining to privacy andor information and cyber security that may be more stringent andor expansive than federal requirements we are also subject to certain privacy data protection data governance and information and cyber security laws in other countries in which we operate including countries in the eu australia canada china japan hong kong india mexico singapore and the united kingdom some of which are more stringent andor expansive than those in the united states and some of which may conflict with each other some countries and the eu have instituted or are considering instituting requirements that make it onerous to transfer personal data to other jurisdictions other countries may require incountry data processing andor incountry storage of data compliance with such laws results in higher technology administrative and other costs for us could limit our ability to optimize the use of our closedloop data and could require use of local technology services some of these laws also require us to provide foreign governments and other third parties broader access to our data and intellectual property data breach and operational outage notification laws or regulatory activities to encourage such notifications and regulatory activity and laws around resiliency business continuity and thirdparty risk management are also becoming more prevalent in jurisdictions outside the united states in which we operate in europe the eu general data protection regulation gdpr imposes legal and compliance obligations on companies that process personal data of individuals in the eu irrespective of the geographical location of the company with the potential for significant fines for noncompliance up to percent of total annual worldwide revenue the gdpr includes among other things a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches in certain circumstances to affected individuals and supervisory authorities the uk gdpr which became effective in january mirrors the compliance requirements and fine structure of the gdpr table of contents antimoney laundering sanctions and anticorruption

sanctions and anticorruption compliance could have material financial legal and reputational consequences antimoney laundering we are subject to a significant number of aml laws and regulations as a result of being a financial company headquartered in the united states as well as having a global presence in the united states the majority of aml requirements are derived from the currency and

the patriot act the antimoney laundering act of the amla enacted in january amended the bank secrecy act and is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize us aml laws many of the statutory provisions in the amla will require additional rulemakings reports and other measures the effects of which are not known at this time in europe aml requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 5th and 6th eu antimoney laundering directives and preceding eu antimoney laundering directives into local laws and regulations numerous other countries such as argentina australia canada india mexico new zealand and russia have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced aml legislation and regulations applicable to american express among other things these laws and regulations require us to establish aml programs that meet certain standards including in some instances expanded reporting particularly in the area of suspicious transactions and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements our aml programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny in some countries including certain member states in the eu any errors failures or delays in complying with aml and counterterrorist financing laws perceived deficiencies in our aml programs or association of our business with money laundering terrorist financing tax fraud or other illicit activity can give rise to significant supervisory criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities or other enforcement actions office of foreign assets control regulation the united states has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries

corporate offense to fail to prevent bribery by an associated person in addition to prohibiting improper payments to foreign government officials failure of the company our subsidiaries colleagues contractors or agents to comply with the fcpa the uk bribery act and other similar laws can expose us andor individual colleagues to investigation prosecution and potentially severe criminal and civil penalties compensation practices our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the federal reserve and the occ the federal banking regulators guidance on sound incentive compensation practices sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage imprudent risktaking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations the three principles provide that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors any deficiencies in our compensation practices that are identified by the banking regulators in connection with their review of our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions enforcement actions may be taken against us if our incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes are determined to pose a risk to our safety and soundness and we have not taken prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies in may the federal banking regulators the securities and exchange commission sec the federal housing finance agency and the national credit union administration reproposed a rule originally proposed in on incentivebased compensation practices the reproposed rule would apply deferral downward adjustment and forfeiture and clawback requirements to incentivebased compensation arrangements granted to senior executive officers and significant risktakers of covered institutions with specific requirements varying based on the asset size of the covered institution and the category of employee if these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to what has been proposed they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our colleagues which could adversely affect our ability to hire retain and motivate key colleagues table of contents
