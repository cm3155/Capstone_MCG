in the global payments industry with card networks issuers and acquirers paperbased transactions eg cash and checks bank transfer models eg wire transfers and automated clearing house or ach as well as evolving and growing alternative mechanisms systems and products that leverage new technologies business models and customer relationships to create payment or financing solutions the payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies consumer habits and merchant needs some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic such as an increased shift to ecommerce and demand for contactless payments as a card issuer we compete with financial institutions that issue generalpurpose credit and debit cards we also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards operate mobile wallets or extend credit we face intense competition for cobrand relationships as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted key business partners with attractive value propositions our global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks including among others china unionpay visa mastercard jcb discover and diners club international which is owned by discover we are the fourth largest generalpurpose card network globally based on purchase volume behind china unionpay visa and mastercard in addition to such networks a range of companies globally including merchant acquirers processors and web and mobilebased payment platforms eg alipay paypal and venmo as well as regional payment networks such as the national payments corporation of india carry out some activities similar to those performed by our gmns business the principal competitive factors that affect the cardissuing merchant and network businesses include the features value and quality of the products and services including customer care rewards programs partnerships benefits and digital and mobile services and the costs associated with providing such features and services reputation and brand recognition the number spending characteristics and credit performance of customers the quantity diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used the attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers merchant acquirers cardholders corporate clients and merchants including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics the number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers the success of marketing and promotional campaigns the speed of innovation and investment in systems technologies and product and service offerings the nature and quality of expense management tools electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities particularly for business customers the security of cardholder merchant and network partner information another aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms systems and products which include payment aggregators digital payment and electronic wallet platforms pointofsale lenders realtime settlement and processing systems financial technology companies digital currencies developed by both governments and the private sector blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies prepaid systems and gift cards and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of closedloop loyalty and rewards functionalities such as ours in addition to the discussion in this section see our operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry in risk factors for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business and our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts including nondiscrimination and honorallcards provisions could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation andor arbitrations substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand in risk factors for a discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively due to government regulations or if ongoing legal proceedings limit our ability to prevent merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products supervision and regulation overview we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial the financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governmental authorities have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations and as a result we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures reviews to assess compliance with laws and regulations by governmental authorities as well as our own internal reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination we have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations in addition legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the offering of consumer financial products and the operation of payment networks resulting in changes to certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases the establishment of broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes see risk factorslegal regulatory and compliance risks for a discussion of the potential impact legislative and regulatory changes may have on our results of operations and financial condition banking regulation federal and state banking laws regulations and policies extensively regulate the company which for purposes of this section refers to american express company as a bank holding company trs and our us bank subsidiary american express national bank aenb both the company and trs are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision regulation and examination by the federal reserve and aenb is supervised regulated and examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ the company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the rulemaking enforcement and examination authority of the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb banking regulators have broad examination and enforcement power including the power to impose substantial fines limit dividends and other capital distributions restrict operations and acquisitions and require divestitures any of which could compromise our competitive position many aspects of our business also are subject to rigorous regulation by other us federal and state regulatory agencies and by nonus government agencies and regulatory bodies activities the bhc act generally limits bank holding companies to activities that are considered to be banking activities and certain closely related activities as noted above each of the company and trs is a bank holding company and each has elected to become a financial holding company which is authorized to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities in order to remain eligible for financial holding company status we must meet certain eligibility requirements those requirements include that each of the company and aenb must be well capitalized and well managed and aenb must have received at least a satisfactory rating on its most recent assessment under the community reinvestment act of the cra the company and trs engage in various activities permissible only for financial holding companies including in particular providing travel agency services acting as a finder and engaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency services if the company fails to meet eligibility requirements for financial holding company status it and its subsidiaries are likely to be barred from engaging in new types of financial activities or making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance on its status as a financial holding company and ultimately could be required to either discontinue the broader range of activities permitted to financial holding companies or divest aenb in addition the company and its subsidiaries are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that the relevant regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound which such authorities generally interpret broadly acquisitions and investments applicable federal and state laws place limitations on the ability of persons to invest in or acquire control of us without providing notice to or obtaining the approval of one or more of our regulators in addition we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit our investments and acquisitions and in some cases subject them to the prior review and approval of our regulators including the federal reserve and the occ federal banking regulators have broad discretion in evaluating proposed acquisitions and investments that are subject to their prior review or approval financial regulatory reform in october the us federal bank regulatory agencies finalized rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions the tailoring rules pursuant to the amendments to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of dodd frank introduced by the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the tailoring rules assign each us bank holding company with billion or more in total consolidated assets as well as its bank subsidiaries to one of four categories based on its status as a us global systemically important banking organization and five other riskbased indicators i size ii crossjurisdictional activity iii nonbank assets iv offbalance sheet exposure and v weighted shortterm wholesale funding under the tailoring rules the company and pursuant to the tailoring rules its depository institution subsidiary aenb is subject to category iv standards because a firms categorization under the tailoring rules is determined by and can change over time dependent upon how the firm measures against the riskbased indicator thresholds we are required to monitor and periodically report these riskbased indicators and there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be a category iv firm in the future capital and liquidity regulation capital rules the company and aenb are required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy rules established by federal banking regulators these rules are intended to ensure that bank holding companies and depository institutions collectively banking organizations have adequate capital given their level of assets and offbalance sheet obligations the federal banking regulators current capital rules the capital rules implement the basel committee on banking supervisions the basel committee framework for strengthening international capital regulation known as basel iii for additional information regarding our capital ratios see consolidated capital resources and liquidity under mda under the capital rules banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for common equity tier cet1 tier capital that is cet1 plus additional tier capital and total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets we report our capital adequacy ratios using riskweighted assets calculated under the standardized approach as a category iv firm we are not subject to the advanced approaches capital requirements in december the basel committee published standards that among other things revise the standardized approach for credit risk including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing additional capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card lines of credit and provide a new standardized calculation for operational risk capital requirements if adopted in the united states as issued by the basel committee and applicable to us the new standards could result in higher capital requirements for us in december federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an optional threeyear phasein period for the adverse regulatory capital effects of adopting the current expected credit loss cecl methodology pursuant to new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on certain financial instruments which became effective january in august federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an option to delay the estimated impact of the adoption of the cecl methodology on regulatory capital for up to two years followed by the threeyear phasein period we elected to adopt the twoyear delay followed by the threeyear phasein period therefore the company will begin phasing in the cumulative amount that is not recognized in regulatory capital at percent per year beginning january see critical accounting estimates under mda for additional information on cecl the company and aenb must each maintain cet1 tier capital and total capital ratios of at least percent percent and percent respectively on top of these minimum capital ratios the company is subject to a dynamic stress capital buffer scb composed entirely of cet1 with a floor of percent and aenb is subject to a static percent capital conservation buffer ccb the scb equals i the difference between a bank holding companys starting and minimum projected cet1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario under the federal reserves stress tests described below plus ii one year of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of riskweighted assets in august the scb requirement for the company was set at percent a bank holding companys scb requirement is generally effective on october of each year and will remain in effect through september of the following year unless it is reset in connection with resubmission of a capital plan as discussed below as a result the effective minimum ratios for the company taking into account the scb requirement and aenb taking into account the ccb requirement are percent percent and percent for the cet1 tier capital and total capital ratios respectively banking organizations whose ratios of cet1 tier capital or total capital to riskweighted assets are below these effective minimum ratios face constraints on discretionary distributions such as dividends repurchases and redemptions of capital securities and executive compensation the capital distribution restrictions for the first quarter of discussed under stress testing and capital planning below are in addition to the scb distribution constraints for bank holding companies at least through march the federal reserve is expected to announce by march any recalibration of the scb requirements announced in august we are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements the leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organizations tier capital to its average total consolidated assets as defined for regulatory purposes all banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least percent liquidity regulation the federal reserves enhanced prudential standards rule includes heightened liquidity and overall risk management requirements the rule requires the maintenance of a liquidity buffer consisting of highly liquid assets that is sufficient to meet projected net outflows for days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios and a minimum liquidity coverage ratio lcr that measures a firms highquality liquid assets to its projected net outflows under the tailoring rules category iv firms with less than billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding such as the company are not subject to any lcr requirement a second standard provided for in the basel iii liquidity framework referred to as the net stable funding ratio nsfr requires a minimum amount of longerterm funding based on the assets and activities of banking entities under the final nsfr rule published in october category iv firms with less than billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding such as the company are not subject to any nsfr requirement stress testing and capital planning under the federal reserves regulations the company is subject to supervisory stress testing requirements that are designed to evaluate whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to absorb losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions as a category iv firm the company was subject to the federal reserves supervisory stress tests in and will be required to participate in the supervisory stress tests every other year thereafter we are required to develop and submit to the federal reserve an annual capital plan in january the federal reserve finalized changes to the capital plan rule which will among other things provide firms subject to category iv standards additional flexibility to develop their capital plans in addition these changes provide that for category iv firms such as the company the portion of the scb based on the federal reserves supervisory stress tests will be calculated every other year during a year in which a category iv firm does not undergo a supervisory stress test the firm will receive an updated scb that reflects the firms updated planned common stock dividends a category iv firm will also be able to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test and consequently receive an updated scb the company must notify the federal reserve by april if it elects to participate in the supervisory stress test as part of the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar the federal reserve evaluates whether the company has sufficient capital to continue operations by assessing our proforma capital position and ratios under a scenario of economic and financial market stress and uses that information to determine the size of the scb for each ccar participating firm due to the continued economic uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic in june the federal reserve required all bank holding companies participating in ccar to resubmit their capital plans in november in addition the federal reserve prohibited share repurchases in the third and fourth quarters of for all bank holding companies participating in ccar and allowed them to pay common stock dividends provided a they did not increase the amount of the dividend and b the dividends did not exceed the average of a firms net income for the four preceding calendar quarters on december the federal reserve released the results of its second round of supervisory stress tests for all bank holding companies participating in ccar based on economic scenarios reflecting changes in financial markets and the macroeconomic outlook the federal reserve announced that it would allow bank holding companies participating in ccar to pay common stock dividends and repurchase common stock in the first quarter of provided a the dividends and repurchases in the aggregate do not exceed the average of a firms net income for the four preceding calendar quarters and b the firm does not increase the amount of its common stock dividends beyond the level paid in the second quarter of the federal reserve also announced that it would permit stock repurchases equal to the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation for additional information regarding our capital distributions see consolidated capital resources and liquidity under mda we may be required to revise and resubmit our capital plan following certain events or developments such as a significant acquisition or an event that could result in a material change in our risk profile or financial condition if we are required to resubmit our capital plan we must receive prior approval from the federal reserve for any capital distributions including common stock dividend payments and share repurchases other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument dividends and other capital distributions the company and trs as well as aenb and the companys insurance and other regulated subsidiaries are limited in their ability to pay dividends by statutes regulations and supervisory policy common stock dividend payments and share repurchases by the company are subject to the oversight of the federal reserve as described above the company will be subject to limitations and restrictions on capital distributions if among other things i the companys regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or ii the company is required to resubmit its capital plan in general federal laws and regulations prohibit without first obtaining the occs approval aenb from making dividend distributions to trs if such distributions are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause aenb to fail to meet capital adequacy standards in addition to specific limitations on the dividends aenb can pay to trs federal banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of a dividend if in the banking regulators opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the institution prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance act fdia requires among other things that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions insured by the fdic such as aenb that do not meet minimum capital requirements the fdia establishes five capital categories for fdicinsured banks well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized the fdia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified in order to be considered well capitalized aenb must maintain cet1 tier capital total capital and tier leverage ratios of percent percent percent and percent respectively under the fdia aenb could be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits ie deposits raised through thirdparty brokerage networks or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is well capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic a portion of our outstanding us retail deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes if a federal regulator determines that we are in an unsafe or unsound condition or that we are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices the regulator may reclassify our capital category or otherwise place restrictions on our ability to accept or solicit brokered deposits on december the fdic finalized a rule intended to update and modernize the fdics brokered deposit regulations the final rule among other things expands the definition of deposit broker and updates the interest rate restrictions for less than well capitalized banks the final rule is expected to become effective on april resolution planning pursuant to dodd frank certain bank holding companies are required to submit resolution plans to the federal reserve and fdic providing for the companys strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure however in connection with the release of the tailoring rules the federal reserve and fdic finalized rules in october which among other things adjust the review cycles and applicability of the agencies resolution planning requirements under these rules category iv firms such as the company are not required to submit a holding company resolution plan aenb continues to be required to prepare and provide a separate resolution plan to the fdic that would enable the fdic as receiver to effectively resolve aenb under the fdia in the event of failure the fdic issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on potential revisions to this separate resolution plan requirement for insured depository institutions in april and temporarily suspended resolution planning requirements for insured depository institutions in january the fdic lifted the moratorium on resolution plan submissions for insured depository institutions with billion or more in assets including aenb and will provide at least 12months advance notice to firms required to submit resolution plans orderly liquidation authority the company could become subject to the orderly liquidation authority ola a resolution regime under which the treasury secretary may appoint the fdic as receiver to liquidate a systemically important financial institution if the company is in danger of default and is determined to present a systemic risk to us financial stability as under the fdic resolution model under the ola the fdic has broad power as receiver substantial differences exist however between the ola and the fdic resolution model for depository institutions including the right of the fdic under the ola to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in limited circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditor claims as opposed to the judicial procedure used in bankruptcy proceedings and the right of the fdic to transfer claims to a bridge entity the fdic has developed a strategy under ola referred to as the single point of entry or spoe strategy under which the fdic would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets including shares of its operating subsidiaries and potentially very limited liabilities to a bridge holding company utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company under this strategy management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and its shareholders and creditors would bear the losses resulting from the failure fdic powers upon insolvency of aenb if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of aenb the fdic has the power to

contract or lease to which aenb is a party the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of aenb in addition the claims of holders of us deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic against aenb would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against aenb including claims of debt holders and depositors in nonus offices in the liquidation or other resolution of aenb as a result whether or not the fdic ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of aenb the debt holders and depositors in nonus offices would be treated differently from and could receive substantially less if anything than the depositors in the us offices of aenb other banking regulations source of strength the company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its us bank subsidiary aenb and may be required to

marketing sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the cfpb which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in addition a number of us states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than us federal laws us federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny on october the cfpb issued a final rule that sets forth additional requirements for thirdparty debt collection agencies which we use in the ordinary course of business see we are exposed to credit risk and trends that affect card member spending and the ability of customers and partners to pay us which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition under risk factors for potential impacts related to legal and regulatory changes on our ability to collect amounts owed to us we are also regulated in the united states under the money transmitter or sale of check laws in effect in most states in addition we are required by the laws of many states to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property laws under which we must pay to states the face amount of any travelers cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period of time depending on the type of product in countries outside the united states regulators continue to focus on a number of key areas impacting our cardissuing businesses particularly consumer protection such as in the european union eu the united kingdom and canada and responsible lending such as in australia mexico new zealand and singapore with increasing importance on and attention to customers and outcomes rather than just ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations regulators expectations of firms in relation to their compliance risk and control frameworks continue to increase and regulators are placing significant emphasis on a firms systems and controls relating to the identification and resolution of issues payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through enforcement actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the eu australia and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants and we have exited our network businesses in the eu and australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions for example in addition there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the eu payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the eu given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements we are subject to regulatory action penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the eu in various countries such as certain member states in the eu and australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging have been challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups and some such laws have been overturned surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage our card members or our business in addition other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could also have a material adverse effect on us if they become widespread see surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations under risk factors in some countries governments have established regulatory regimes that require international card networks to be locally licensed andor to localize aspects of their operations for example the reserve bank of india which has broad power under the payment and settlement systems act to regulate the membership and operations of card networks has issued a mandate requiring payment systems operators in india to store certain payments data locally governments in some countries also provide resources or protection to select domestic payment card networks the development and enforcement of these and other similar laws regulations and policies may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network privacy data protection data governance information and cyber security regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy data protection data governance and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide we have established and continue to maintain policies and a governance framework to comply with applicable privacy data protection data governance and information and cyber security laws and requirements meet evolving customer and industry expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth our regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that our privacy data protection data governance and information and cyber securityrelated policies and practices are adequate to inform customers of our data collection use sharing andor security practices to provide them with choices if required about how we use and share their information and to appropriately safeguard their personal information and account access regulators are also focused on data management data governance and our thirdparty risk management policies and practices in the united states certain of our businesses are subject to the privacy disclosure and safeguarding provisions of the grammleachbliley act glba and its implementing regulations and guidance among other things glba imposes certain limitations on our ability to share consumers nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties and requires us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the size and complexity of our business the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of customer information that we process we are required to offer expanded privacy rights to california residents who are not covered by glba pursuant to the california consumer privacy act various regulators us states and territories are considering similar requirements or have adopted laws rules and regulations pertaining to privacy andor information and cyber security that may be more stringent andor expansive than federal requirements we are also subject to certain privacy data protection data governance and information and cyber security laws in other countries in which we operate including countries in the eu australia canada china japan hong kong india mexico singapore and the united kingdom some of which are more stringent andor expansive than those in the united states some countries have also instituted laws requiring incountry data processing andor incountry storage of data compliance with such laws could result in higher technology administrative and other costs for us could limit our ability to optimize the use of our closedloop data and could require use of local technology services certain laws also require us to provide foreign governments and other third parties broader access to our data and intellectual property data breach and operational outage notification laws or regulatory activities to encourage such notifications are also becoming more prevalent in jurisdictions outside the united states in which we operate in europe the eu general data protection regulation gdpr imposes legal and compliance obligations on companies that process personal data of individuals in the eu irrespective of the geographical location of the company with significant fines for noncompliance up to percent of total annual worldwide revenue we continue to rely on our binding corporate rules as the primary method for lawfully transferring data from our european affiliates to our affiliates in the united states and elsewhere globally the gdpr includes among other things a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches in certain circumstances to affected individuals and supervisory authorities the gdpr was transposed into uk domestic law in january following the united kingdoms exit from the eu this is known as the uk gdpr and it supplements the united kingdoms data protection act of the uk gdpr mirrors the compliance requirements and fine structure of the gdpr in addition the european directive 200258ec the eprivacy directive will continue to set out requirements for the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector until the approval of the forthcoming eprivacy regulation the eprivacy directive places restrictions on among other things the sending of unsolicited marketing communications as well as on the collection and use of data about internet users the european central bank and the european banking authority have enacted or are considering secondary legislation focused on security breaches outsourcing resiliency strong customer authentication and information securityrelated policies likewise a network and information security directive has been implemented into national laws by member states in the eu the revised payment services directive psd2 also contains regulatory requirements on strong customer authentication open access to customer data and payment capabilities and measures

laundering american express is subject to a significant number of aml laws and regulations as a result of being a financial company headquartered in the united states as well as having a global

and is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize us aml laws many of the statutory provisions in the amla will require additional rulemakings reports and other measures the effects of which are not known at this time in europe aml requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 5th and 6th eu antimoney laundering directives and preceding eu antimoney laundering directives into local laws and regulations numerous other countries such as argentina australia canada india mexico new zealand and russia have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced aml legislation and regulations applicable to american express among other things these laws and regulations require us to establish aml programs that meet certain standards including in some instances expanded reporting particularly in the area of suspicious transactions and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements our aml programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny in some countries any errors failures or delays in complying with federal state or foreign aml and counterterrorist financing laws or perceived deficiencies in our aml programs could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits penalties and forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions office of foreign assets control regulation the united states has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others the united states prohibits us persons from engaging with individuals and entities identified as specially designated nationals such

the activities are sanctionable under us law in we became aware of credit card accounts opened with american express international inc hong kong branch by the acting consul general of the iranian consulate in hong kong and his predecessor the nowformer consul general we believe these cards were used only for personal expenses the acting consul general had two cards both of which were opened in and one of which was closed by client request on or about april and the other of which was cancelled by us on or about june the former consul generals card was issued in january and cancelled by us on or about march we had negligible gross revenues and net profits attributable to these accounts as all of the accounts were cancelled we do not intend to continue to engage in this activity

individual colleagues to investigation prosecution and potentially severe criminal and civil penalties compensation practices our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the federal reserve the federal banking regulators guidance on sound incentive compensation practices sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage imprudent risktaking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations the three principles provide that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors any deficiencies in our compensation practices that are identified by the federal reserve or other banking regulators in connection with their review of our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions enforcement actions may be taken against us if our incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes are determined to pose a risk to our safety and soundness and we have not taken prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies in may the federal banking regulators the securities and exchange commission sec the federal housing finance agency and the national credit union administration reproposed a rule originally proposed in on incentivebased compensation practices the reproposed rule would apply deferral downward adjustment and forfeiture and clawback requirements to incentivebased compensation arrangements granted to senior executive officers and significant risktakers of covered institutions with specific requirements varying based on the asset size of the covered institution and the category of employee if these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to what has been proposed they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our
