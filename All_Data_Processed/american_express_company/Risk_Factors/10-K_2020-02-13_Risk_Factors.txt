item risk factors this section highlights specific risks that could affect us and our businesses broadly categorized as strategic business and competitive risks legal regulatory and compliance risks and credit liquidity and market risks you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including the risk management section under mda which describes our approach to identifying monitoring and managing the risks we assume in conducting our businesses and provides certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks based on the information currently known to us we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the following risks develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks occur or continue to occur these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations these events or circumstances could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities strategic business and competitive risks difficult conditions in the business and economic environment as well as political conditions in the united states and elsewhere may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations our results of operations are materially affected by economic market political and social conditions in the united states and abroad we offer a broad array of products and services to consumers small businesses and commercial clients and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing products slow economic growth volatile or deteriorating economic conditions or shifts in broader consumer and business trends significantly impact customer behaviors including spending on our cards the ability and willingness of card members to borrow and pay amounts owed to us and demand for feebased products and services political conditions prolonged or recurring government shutdowns regional hostilities and the prospect or occurrence of more widespread conflicts social upheaval fiscal and monetary policies trade wars and tariffs could also negatively affect consumer and business spending including travel patterns and business investment and demand for credit factors such as consumer spending and confidence unemployment rates business investment geopolitical instability election results government spending trade relationships with other countries interest rates taxes energy costs the volatility and strength of the capital markets inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment and ultimately our profitability such factors may also cause our earnings billings loan balances credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business adversely affecting andor increasing the volatility of the trading price of our common shares travel and entertainment expenditures which comprised approximately percent of our us billed business during for example are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns likewise spending by small businesses and corporate clients which comprised approximately percent of our worldwide billed business during depends in part on the economic environment and a favorable climate for continued business investment and new business formation increases in delinquencies and writeoff rates as a result of increases in bankruptcies unemployment rates changes in customer behaviors or otherwise could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations the consequences of negative circumstances impacting us or the environment generally can be sudden and severe our business is subject to the effects of geopolitical events weather natural disasters and other conditions geopolitical events terrorist attacks natural disasters severe weather conditions floods health pandemics including the recent coronavirus outbreak information or cyber security incidents including intrusion into or degradation of systems or technology by cyberattackers and other catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our business because of our proximity to the world trade center our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of september recent hurricanes and other natural disasters have impacted spending and credit performance in the areas affected similar events or other disasters or catastrophic events in the future and events impacting other sectors of the economy including the telecommunications and energy sectors could have a negative effect on our businesses and infrastructure including our technology and systems climate change may exacerbate certain of these threats including the frequency and severity of weatherrelated events card members in california new york florida texas georgia and new jersey account for a significant portion of us consumer billed business and card members loans and our results of operations could be impacted by events or conditions that disproportionately or specifically affect one or more of those states because we derive a portion of our revenues from travelrelated spending our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism limitations on travel and mobility and healthrelated risks including travel restrictions and bans as a result of the recent coronavirus outbreak in addition disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel interruption insurance policies we offer and if such disruptions to travel are prolonged they can materially adversely affect overall travelrelated spending if the conditions described above or similar ones result in widespread or lengthy disruptions to travel they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations card member spending may also be negatively impacted in areas affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events the impact of such events on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations the exit of the united kingdom from the european union could materially adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition our business in the united kingdom and elsewhere may be negatively impacted by the exit of the united kingdom from the eu commonly referred to as brexit on january including from a deterioration of the economic environment in the united kingdom and other countries in which we operate that adversely affects spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of card members to pay amounts owed to us we may also experience increased volatility in the value of the pound sterling the euro and other european currencies which could further strengthen the us dollar adversely impacting the results of operations from our international activities in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the united kingdom and the eu and we may incur additional costs or need to make operational changes that reduce revenue as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business and financial results as of december the united kingdom constituted approximately percent of our worldwide billed business and the emea region as a whole constituted approximately percent we have made changes to the structure of our business operations in europe in anticipation of brexit although the financial trade and legal implications of brexit remain uncertain and may be more severe than expected given the lack of comparable precedent our operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry the payments industry is highly competitive and we compete with card networks issuers and acquirers paperbased transactions eg cash and checks bank transfer models eg wire transfers and ach as well as evolving and growing alternative nontraditional payment and financing providers if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors develop compelling value propositions for our customers andor effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and emerging technologies we may not be able to compete effectively we believe visa and mastercard are larger than we are in most countries as a result card issuers and acquirers on the visa and mastercard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position scale resources marketing and pricing of those networks our business may also be increasingly negatively affected if we are unable to increase or maintain merchant acceptance and our cards are not accepted at merchants that accept cards on the visa and mastercard networks some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or crossselling strategies to acquire and retain more customers capture a greater share of spending and borrowings establish and develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors expenses such as card member rewards and card member services expenses could continue to increase as we improve our value propositions for card members including in response to increased competition spending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of charge credit and debit cards issued on other networks as well as adoption of alternative payment systems the fragmentation of customer spending to take advantage of different merchant or card incentives or for convenience with technological solutions may continue to increase to the extent other payment mechanisms systems and products continue to successfully expand our discount revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our integrated payments platform could be negatively impacted for example companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices at the point of sale or through digital wallets commercerelated experiences mobile applications or other technologies could choose not to accept suppress use of or degrade the experience of using our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets experiences or applications impacting our profitability on transactions the competitive value of our closedloop data may also be diminished as traditional and nontraditional competitors use other new data sources and technologies to derive similar insights certain regulations such as psd2 in europe and open banking initiatives in various jurisdictions around the world could also diminish the value of our closedloop data or the demand for our products and services by disintermediating existing financial services providers to the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with relevant customers regulators and industry participants which could adversely affect our ability to compete laws and business practices that favor local competitors require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could limit our growth in international regions we may face additional compliance and regulatory risks to the extent that we expand into new business areas and we may need to dedicate more expense time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions many of our competitors are subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems more restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure we face intense competition for partner relationships which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations in the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries for example we have partnered with delta marriott british airways and hilton as well as many others globally to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses and through our membership rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries including delta and others in the airline industry to offer benefits to card member participants see business partners and relationships under business for additional information on our business partnerships including with delta competition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to highspending loyal customers all of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december card member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide card member loans as of december cobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period generally ranging from five to ten years and will terminate in accordance with their terms including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise we work with our cobrand partners on an ongoing basis to demonstrate the value we deliver and evolve our relationships for the benefit of both parties we face the risk that we could lose partner relationships even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships we may also choose to not renew certain cobrand relationships the volume of billed business could decline and card member attrition could increase in each case significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships in addition some of our cobrand arrangements provide that upon expiration or termination the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our card member loans outstanding we regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us as competition for such relationships continues to increase we make payments to our cobrand partners which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained the amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased particularly in the united states and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks see offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations under mda for additional information regarding commitments for payments to certain cobrand partners the loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners the loss of the partner relationship altogether whether by nonrenewal at the end of the contract period such as the end of our relationship with costco in the united states in or as the result of a merger legal or regulatory action or otherwise such as the withdrawal of american airlines in from our airport club access program for centurion and platinum card members or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations see our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the eu in addition any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation making it more difficult to attract and retain card members and merchants and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business we are exposed to risks associated with our business partners including reputational issues business slowdowns bankruptcies liquidations restructurings and consolidations and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners our success is in many ways dependent on the success of our business partners from customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating b2b supplier payments for our corporate clients we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business see business partners and relationships under business for additional information on our business partnerships to the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products experience a slowdown in their business operational disruptions reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders our business may be materially negatively impacted in addition we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels if we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations see contractual obligations under mda for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners similarly we are exposed to risk from bankruptcies liquidations insolvencies financial distress restructurings consolidations and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business which could negatively impact particular card products and services and billed business generally and our financial condition and results of operations we could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse card members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards for example we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect card members against nondelivery of goods and services such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a card member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or flown if we are unable to collect the amount from the airline we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the card member spending at airline merchants accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december for additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry see risk managementinstitutional credit riskexposure to the airline and travel industry under mda we face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards for payment for goods and services unlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on revolving credit balances to drive profits our business model is more focused on card member spending discount revenue which represents fees generally charged to merchants when card members use their cards to purchase goods and services on our network is primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source our average merchant discount rate has been impacted by regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries we also face pressure from competitors that have other sources of income or lower costs that can make their pricing more attractive to business partners and merchants merchants are also able to negotiate incentives and pricing concessions from us as a condition to accepting our cards or being cobrand partners as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives andor concessions we provide to such merchants which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives we have also experienced erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we increase merchant acceptance we may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants in addition the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from nontraditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate some merchants continue to invest in their own payment solutions such as proprietarybranded mobile wallets using both traditional and new technology platforms if merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and billed business volumes a continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants which if not successful could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results we may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in valueadded services for merchants and card members surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in certain countries such as australia and certain member states in the eu merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchases in jurisdictions allowing surcharging we have seen merchant surcharging on american express cards in certain merchant categories and in some cases either the surcharge is greater than that applied to visa and mastercard cards or visa and mastercard cards are not surcharged at all practices that are known as differential surcharging even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging have been overturned in litigation brought by merchant groups we also encounter merchants that accept our cards but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards our card members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to and we therefore take steps to meet our card members expectations and to protect the american express brand by prohibiting this form of discrimination subject to local legal requirements if surcharging steering or other forms of discrimination become widespread american express cards and credit and charge cards generally could become less desirable to consumers which could result in a decrease in cardsinforce and transaction volumes the impact could vary depending on such factors as the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied how card members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale the ease and speed of implementation for merchants including as a result of new or emerging technologies the size and recurrence of the underlying charges and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment including whether it varies depending on the type of card eg credit or debit product network acquirer or issuer discrimination against american express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations particularly to the extent it disproportionately impacts our card members or our business we may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion merchant acceptance and card member rewards and services or to effectively control the costs of such investments both of which may materially impact our profitability revenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue we have been investing in a number of growth initiatives including to attract new card members reduce card member attrition and capture a greater share of customers total spending and borrowings there can be no assurance that our investments to acquire card members provide differentiated features and services and increase usage of our cards will continue to be effective in addition if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for shortterm incentives rather than incentivize longterm loyalty card member attrition and costs could increase increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards if we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance or merchants decide to no longer accept american express cards our business could suffer further expanding our service offerings adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements and could adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand another way we invest in customer value is through our membership rewards program as well as other card member benefits any significant change in or failure by management to reasonably estimate actual redemptions of membership rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability we rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future which could diminish the value of the program for our card members our two largest redemption partners are amazon and delta in addition many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours our inability to continue to differentiate our products and services generally could materially adversely affect us we may not be able to costeffectively manage and expand card member benefits including containing the growth of marketing promotion rewards and card member services expenses in the future if such expenses increase beyond our expectations we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume increasing other areas of revenues such as feebased revenues or both we may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment our brand and reputation are key assets of our company and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace our brand and its attributes are key assets and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business card members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices data use and protection management workplace culture merchant acceptance financial condition our response to unexpected events and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correctcould erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential card members corporate clients merchants and partners which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances including card practices regulatory compliance the use and protection of customer information and conduct by our colleagues and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto discussion about such matters in social media channels can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brand our brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control for example any shortcoming of or controversy related to a thirdparty vendor business partner merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by card members and merchants to us thus damaging our reputation and brand value the lack of acceptance suppression of card usage or surcharging by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us furthermore as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the united states a negative perception of the united states arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes revenues and profitability a major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards we and third parties process transmit store and provide access to account information in connection with our charge and credit cards and other products and in the normal course of our business we collect analyze and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers and colleagues our networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our business operations and capture destroy manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets customer information including card member travel and loyalty program data colleague information and other sensitive business information including acquisition activity nonpublic financial results and intellectual property there are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors including criminal activities such as fraud identity theft and ransom corporate or nationstate espionage political agendas public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm intent to disrupt information technology systems and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites global financial institutions like us as well as our customers colleagues regulators vendors and other third parties have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks including computer viruses malicious or destructive code ransomware social engineering attacks including phishing impersonation and identity takeover attempts corporate espionage hacking website defacement denialofservice attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the misconfiguration or unauthorized use of or access to computer systems for example we and other us financial services providers have been the target of distributed denialofservice attacks from sophisticated third parties these threats can arise from external parties as well as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious cyber activities we develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incidents and fraudulent activity which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated despite our efforts the possibility of information and cyber security incidents malicious social engineering corporate espionage fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology is deployed including the increasing use of personal mobile and computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments risks associated with each of these include theft of funds and other monetary loss the disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse modification loss or destruction of confidential proprietary trade secret or other information including account data information the effects of which could be compounded if not detected quickly indeed an information or cyber security incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered information or cyber security incidents fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy andor security has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention such as mandatory card reissuance increased litigation including class action litigation remediation fines and response costs negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies reputational and financial damage to our brand and reduced usage of our products and services all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business the disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resources successful cyberattacks data breaches disruptions or other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy andor security at other large financial institutions large retailers travel and hospitality companies government agencies or other market participants whether or not we are impacted could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our products and services such events could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements although we maintain cyber insurance there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate the uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our information technology systems including our transaction authorization clearing and settlement systems and data centers may experience service disruptions or degradation because of technology malfunction sudden increases in customer transaction volume natural disasters accidents power outages internet outages telecommunications failures fraud denialofservice and other cyberattacks terrorism computer viruses vulnerabilities in hardware or software physical or electronic breakins or similar events service disruptions or degradations could prevent access to our online services and account information compromise or limit access to company or customer data impede transaction processing and financial reporting and lead to regulatory investigations and fines increased regulatory oversight and litigation any such service disruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our products and services and materially adversely affect our overall business reputation and results of operations we rely on thirdparty providers for acquiring and servicing customers technology platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses these third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business we rely on thirdparty service providers cobrand partners merchants customer acquisition channels processors aggregators network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business as outsourcing specialization of functions thirdparty digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase including with respect to mobile technologies tokenization big data artificial intelligence and cloud storage solutions more third parties are involved in processing card transactions and handling our data for example we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network card acquisition and provision of services to our customers if a service provider or other third party ceases to provide the data quality or communications capacity we expect or services upon which we rely as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions or errors terrorism information or cyber security incidents or any other reason the failure could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers or impact our ability to grow our business the confidentiality integrity privacy availability andor security of data communicated over thirdparty networks or platforms or held by or accessible to third parties including merchants that accept our cards payment processors payment intermediaries and our thirdparty vendors and business partners could become compromised which could lead to unauthorized use of our data or fraudulent transactions on our cards as well as costs associated with responding to such an incident including regulatory investigations and fines increased regulatory oversight and litigation for example in march we were alerted by expedia that certain customers who used expedias orbitz platform may have been victims of a cyberattack the attack involved an orbitz platform that served as the underlying booking engine for online travel websites including amextravelcom and travel booked through amex travel representatives we are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other event at a third party affecting one of our service providers or partners could impede their ability to provide to us services or data on which we rely to operate our business service providers or other third parties could also cease providing data to us or use our data in a way that diminishes the competitive value of our closed loop the management and oversight of multiple vendors increases our operational complexity and governance challenges and decreases our control a failure to exercise adequate oversight over service providers including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements could result in regulatory actions fines litigation sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us in addition we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors service providers we are also exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a common service provider to our vendors could impede their ability to provide services to us notwithstanding any attempts to diversify our reliance on third parties we may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors use of common service providers if we are not able to invest successfully in and compete at the leading edge of technological developments across all our businesses our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes in order to compete in our industry we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business including in transaction processing data management and analytics machine learning and artificial intelligence customer interactions and communications open banking and alternative payment mechanisms authentication technologies and digital identification tokenization realtime settlement and risk management and compliance systems incorporating new technologies into our products and services including developing the appropriate governance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful we expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies may be superior to or render obsolete our existing technology the process of developing new products and services enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours in addition we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new products and services before they generate significant revenues if at all our ability to develop acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties including competitors and potential competitors may assert in addition our ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industrywide standards a changing legislative and regulatory environment an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls a lack of internal product and engineering expertise resistance to change from card members or merchants or the complexity of our systems we may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and investment activity and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected we have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments and continue to evaluate potential transactions these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and secure future acquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us or successfully complete proposed acquisitions and investments which could impair our growth the process of integrating an acquired company business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures result in unanticipated liabilities including legal claims violations of laws commercial disputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches and harm our business generally it may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results including as a result of writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets we may also face risks with other types of strategic transactions such as the sale to incomm of the operations relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business the reloadable operations have experienced disruptions in the past impacting the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards if such operations are interrupted suspended or terminated in the future it could further negatively impact our customers experience result in additional costs litigation and regulatory action and harm our business and reputation joint ventures including our gbt jv and our new joint venture in china and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment in addition we may be dependent on joint venture partners controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours for example trade secrets and other proprietary information we may provide to a joint venture may become available to third parties beyond our control the ability to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner controlling shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand our success is dependent on maintaining a culture of integrity and respect as well as upon our executive officers and other key personnel and misconduct by or loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business we rely upon our key personnel not only for business success but also to lead with integrity and promote a culture of respect to the extent our leaders behave in a manner that does not comport with our companys values the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations the market for qualified individuals is highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel who voluntarily or involuntarily leave the company changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel or to employ such personnel in the locations of our choice as further described in supervision and regulationcompensation practices our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the federal reserve and the compensation practices of aenb is subject to review and oversight by the occ this regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business legal regulatory and compliance risks our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world which significantly affects our business and requires continual enhancement of our compliance efforts regulatory oversight and supervision of our businesses are generally designed to protect consumers and enhance financial stability and are not designed to protect our security holders supervision efforts and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations impact the scope and profitability of our existing business activities limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and adopt new technologies and affect our relationships with card members partners merchants vendors and other third parties new laws or regulations could similarly affect our business increase our costs of doing business and require us to change certain of our business practices and invest significant management attention and resources all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each others approaches to the regulation of the payments industry consequently a development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another to the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts if we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares or engage in certain business activities or acquisitions additionally our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital in recent years legislators and regulators have focused on the operation of card networks including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as visa and mastercard and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants including terms relating to nondiscrimination and honorallcards for example we have largely exited our network businesses in the eu and australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions in addition there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the eu payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the eu in a ruling issued on february the eu court of justice confirmed the validity of the application of the fee caps and other provisions in circumstances where threeparty networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent although the ruling provided only limited guidance as to when or how the provisions might apply in such circumstances and remains subject to differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements as a result there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the eu furthermore the european commission is in the process of conducting an impact assessment of the interchange fee caps which could potentially result in lower andor additional interchange fee caps and restrictions we are subject to certain provisions of the bank secrecy act as amended by the patriot act with regard to maintaining effective aml programs similar aml requirements apply under the laws of most jurisdictions where we operate increased regulatory focus in this area is likely to result in increased costs related to oversight supervision and fines and may result in changes to our business practices including restrictions with respect to the types of products and services we may offer to consumers the countries in which our cards may be used and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards emerging technologies such as digital currencies could limit our ability to track the movement of funds money laundering terrorist financing and other illicit activities involving our business could result in enforcement action and our reputation may suffer due to our customers association with certain countries persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions various regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft account management guidelines credit bureau reporting disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact us directly in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management standards these new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions which could adversely affect our revenue growth see supervision and regulation for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments andor requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses damage to our reputation andor a material adverse effect on our business businesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been subject to significant legal actions including class action lawsuits many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages while we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities risks and costs associated with class action cases the continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation matters we have been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be subject to such actions including governmental inquiries investigations and enforcement proceedings in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations for example we have been cooperating with certain governmental authorities that have requested information from or served subpoenas on us seeking information relating to a small specialized part of our business known as foreign exchange international payments fxip which offers crossborder payments services primarily to small and middle market business customers in five countries including the united states in particular we received investigative subpoenas from both the civil and criminal divisions of the us department of justice as well as inquiries from the federal reserve the occ the cfpb the fdic and others fxip accounts for less than one half of one percent of our total revenue net of interest expense and is unrelated to our card businesses relatedly our review of fxips pricing practices conducted with an outside law firm has concluded and as a result we voluntarily provided approximately million of remediation to certain customers covering a fiveyear period and took disciplinary action where appropriate we do not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on our operations or results we expect that regulators will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through nonpublic supervisory actions or findings which could involve restrictions on our activities among other limitations that could adversely affect our business in addition a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us further a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings regulatory action could subject us to significant fines penalties or other requirements resulting in card member reimbursements increased expenses limitations or conditions on our business activities and damage to our reputation and our brand which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation andor arbitrations substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand we are and have been in the past a defendant in a number of actions including legal proceedings and proposed class actions filed by merchants challenging certain provisions of our card acceptance agreements a description of the outstanding legal proceedings is contained in legal proceedings an adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the card member experience result in additional litigation andor arbitrations impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements changes in visas and mastercards policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and if we fail to meet these rules our business would be materially adversely affected failure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the federal reserve including limiting our ability to pay dividends repurchase our capital stock invest in our business expand our business or engage in acquisitions some elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial institutions for example the basel committee finalized revisions to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital requirements if these revisions are adopted in the united states we could be required to hold significantly more capital as a result the ultimate impact on our longterm capital and liquidity planning and our results of operations is not certain although an increase in our capital and liquid asset levels could lower our return on equity as part of our required stress testing we must continue to comply with applicable capital standards as calculated under the standardized approach in the severely adverse economic scenario published by the federal reserve to satisfy these requirements it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital in excess of that required by the capital rules compliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules requires a material investment of resources an inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of us and our us bank subsidiary by federal banking regulators for more information on capital adequacy requirements see stress testing and capital planning and capital leverage and liquidity regulation under supervision and regulation we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us which may adversely affect our liquidity we are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice for example we are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans that include among other things projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock to the federal reserve for review as part of the capital planning and stress testing process our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment if the federal reserve objects to our capital plan or if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted in addition the capital rules include buffers that can be satisfied only with cet1 capital if our riskbased capital ratios were to fall below the applicable buffer levels we would be subject to certain restrictions on dividends stock repurchases and other capital distributions as well as discretionary bonus payments to executive officers our ability to declare or pay dividends on or to purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock will be prohibited subject to certain exceptions in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our series b and series c preferred stock american express company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity and federal and state laws regulations and supervisory policy limit the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries may pay to the parent company for example our us bank subsidiary aenb is subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on its declaration and payment of dividends these limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations make dividend payments on outstanding american express company capital stock or otherwise achieve strategic objectives any reduction of or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of american express for more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions see dividends and other capital distributions under supervision and regulation as well as consolidated capital resources and liquidityshare repurchases and dividends under mda and note to our consolidated financial statements regulation in the areas of privacy data protection account access and information and cyber security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities and how we collect andor use personal information legislators and regulators in the united states and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy data protection and information and cyber security laws including data localization authentication and account access laws as such laws are interpreted and applied in some cases with significant differences or conflicting requirements across jurisdictions compliance and technology costs will continue to increase particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection data transfer and account access mechanisms are in place compliance with current or future privacy data protection account access and information and cyber security laws could significantly impact our collection use sharing retention and safeguarding of consumer andor colleague information and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closedloop capability or provide certain products and services which could materially and adversely affect our profitability our failure to comply with privacy data protection account access and information and cyber security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory andor governmental investigations andor actions litigation fines sanctions ongoing regulatory monitoring customer attrition decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand in recent years there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy data protection and information and cyber security in the united states the eu and various other countries in which we operate for more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area see privacy data protection information and cyber security under supervision and regulation we may not be able to effectively manage the operational conduct and compliance risks to which we are exposed we consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes or information systems poor data quality human error or the external environment eg natural disasters operational risk includes among others the risk that error or misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement a failure to monitor a third partys compliance with regulatory or legal requirements or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to or use of data in our systems we grant to thirdparties as processes or organizations are changed or new products and services are introduced we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes through human error fraud or malfeasance conduct risk can result in harm to customers broader markets and the company and its employees compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws rules regulations and internal policies and procedures operational conduct and compliance risks can expose us to reputational and legal risks as well as fines civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations if we are not able to protect our intellectual property or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to and distribution of our trade secrets and other proprietary information these measures may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage the ability to enforce intellectual property rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions in addition competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual propertyrelated litigation a future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues incur significant defense license royalty or technology development expenses andor pay significant monetary damages tax legislative initiatives or assessments by governmental authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions the laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations although management believes our positions are reasonable we are subject to audit by the internal revenue service in the united states and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations we are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of valueadded taxes vat to certain transactions while we believe we comply with all applicable vat and other tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities new tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities new guidance or modifications to the tax cuts and jobs act of the tax act could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition unilateral or multijurisdictional actions by various tax authorities including an increase in tax audit activity could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities credit liquidity and market risks our risk management policies and procedures may not be effective our risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return we have established policies and procedures intended to identify monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject including credit risk market risk asset liability risk liquidity risk operational risk compliance risk model risk strategic and business risk and reputational risk see risk management under mda for a discussion of the policies and procedures we use to identify monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future these policies and procedures as well as our risk management techniques such as our hedging strategies may not be fully effective there may also be risks that exist or develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated as regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes if our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical andor forecasting models although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation the modeling methodology or key assumptions could be erroneous or the models could be misused in addition issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs could result in ineffective or inaccurate model outputs and reports for example models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes and their ability to appropriately predict future outcomes may degrade over time upon the adoption of the new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on certain financial instruments effective january we began using a new credit reserve methodology which requires measurement of expected credit losses for the estimated life of the financial instrument not only based on historical experience and current conditions but also by including forecasts incorporating forwardlooking information if our business decisions or estimates for credit losses are based on incorrect or misused models and assumptions or we fail to manage data inputs effectively and to aggregate or analyze data in an accurate and timely manner our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected we may not be able to effectively manage individual or institutional credit risk or credit trends that can affect spending on card products and the ability of customers and partners to pay us which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we are exposed to both individual credit risk principally from consumer and small business card member loans and receivables and institutional credit risk principally from corporate card member loans and receivables merchants network partners loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons general economic factors such as the rate of inflation unemployment levels and interest rates may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses country regional and political risks can also contribute to credit risk a customers ability and willingness to repay us can be negatively impacted not only by economic market political and social conditions but by a customers other payment obligations and increasing leverage can result in a higher risk that customers will default or become delinquent in their obligations to us we rely principally on the customers creditworthiness for repayment of the loan or receivable and therefore have no other recourse for collection our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations further our pricing strategies may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future writeoffs and may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses higher writeoff rates and the resulting increase in our reserves for loan and receivable losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations and may increase our cost of funds although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables these estimates may not be accurate in addition the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete as noted above we began using a new credit reserve methodology effective january which differs significantly from our previous approach and alters the estimation process inputs and assumptions used in estimating expected credit losses for loans and receivables the new methodology may have a significant effect on our reported results and could cause fluctuations in our reported results even if there are no underlying changes in the economics of the business for more information on recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect such as fraud in addition our ability to manage credit risk may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as restrictions on collections or changes in bankruptcy laws minimum payment regulations and reage guidance increased credit risk whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables deteriorating economic conditions particularly in the united states where approximately percent of our revenues were generated in increases in the level of loan balances changes in our mix of business or otherwise could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition interest rate increases could materially adversely affect our earnings if the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans our net interest yield and consequently our net interest income could fall our interest expense was approximately billion for the year ended december a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to our annual net interest income of approximately million as of december we expect the rates we pay on our deposits will increase if benchmark interest rates increase in addition interest rate changes may affect customer behavior such as impacting the loan balances card members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements further impacting our results of operations for a further discussion of our interest rate risk see risk management market risk management process under mda uncertainty relating to libor and other reference rates and their potential discontinuance may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements due to uncertainty surrounding the suitability and sustainability of the london interbank offered rate libor central banks and global regulators have called for financial market participants to prepare for the discontinuance of libor by the end of and the establishment of alternative reference rates at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other reference rate the establishment of alternative reference rates or the impact of any such events on contractual mechanisms may have on the markets us or our financial instruments or commercial agreements that reference libor certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements contain provisions to replace libor as the benchmark following the occurrence of specified transition events such provisions may not be sufficient to trigger a change in the benchmark at all times when libor is no longer representative of market interest rates or that these events will align with similar events in the market generally or in other parts of the financial markets such as the derivatives market alternative reference rates are calculated using components different from those used in the calculation of libor and may fluctuate differently than and not be representative of libor in order to compensate for these differences certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements allow for a benchmark replacement adjustment however there is no assurance that any benchmark replacement adjustment will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of libor either at the benchmark replacement date or over the life of such instruments and agreements uncertainty as to the nature and timing of the potential discontinuance or modification of libor the replacement of libor with one or more alternative reference rates or other reforms may negatively impact market liquidity our access to funding required to operate our business and the trading market for our financial instruments furthermore the timing of implementation and use of alternative reference rates and corresponding adjustments or other reforms could be subject to disputes could cause the interest payable on our outstanding financial instruments and commercial agreements to be materially different than expected and may impact the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements for a further discussion on libor transition see risk management libor transition under mda adverse financial market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs access to capital and cost of capital we need liquidity to pay merchants operating and other expenses interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities the principal sources of our liquidity are payments from card members proceeds from the issuance of unsecured medium and longterm notes and asset securitizations and direct and thirdparty sourced deposits cash flows from our investment portfolio cash and cash equivalents securitized borrowings through our secured borrowing facilities a committed bank credit facility and the federal reserve discount window our ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on market conditions disruptions uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace in a timely manner maturing liabilities satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business in some circumstances we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility for a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs see consolidated capital resources and liquidity funding programs and activities under mda any reduction in our and our subsidiaries credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition rating agencies regularly evaluate us and our subsidiaries and their ratings of our and our subsidiaries longterm and shortterm debt and deposits are based on a number of factors including financial strength as well as factors not within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and the wider state of the economy our and our subsidiaries ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies which could among other things adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we and our subsidiaries are able to obtain funding adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital during approximately percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the united states we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar including as a result of brexit which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations foreign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into us dollars or our ability to transfer them political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local card issuer of obligations arising out of local card members spending outside such country and for the payment by card members who are billed in a currency other than their local currency substantial and sudden devaluation of local card members currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in connection with spending outside the local country the occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations an inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business our us bank subsidiary aenb accepts deposits directly from consumers through american express personal savings as well as from individuals through thirdparty brokerage networks and uses the proceeds as a source of funding as of december we had approximately billion in total us retail deposits of which a significant amount had been raised through thirdparty brokerage networks we face strong and increasing competition with regard to deposits and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain costeffective deposit balances if we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits our funding costs will be adversely impacted our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on aenbs capital levels the fdias brokered deposit provisions and related fdic rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid additionally our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses an inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our business the value of our investments may be adversely impacted by economic political or market conditions market risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables which could negatively impact our financial condition we held approximately billion of investment securities as of december in the event that actual default rates of these investment securities were to significantly change from historical patterns due to economic conditions or otherwise it could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio potentially resulting in impairment charges defaults or economic disruptions even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure conduct business or have operations could adversely affect us
