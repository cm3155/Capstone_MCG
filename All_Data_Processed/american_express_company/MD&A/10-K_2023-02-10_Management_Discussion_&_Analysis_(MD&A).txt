the year demonstrate that our growth strategy is working and our business is in an even stronger position today than before the pandemic spending on our network reached record levels and credit metrics remain below prepandemic levels our investments in product innovation technology people and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with millennial and gen z customers record new card acquisitions deeper relationships with customers and expanded merchant acceptance for we reported net income of billion or per share compared with net income of billion or per share a year ago the reduction in net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our amex ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable credit reserve releases and significant net gains in our amex ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year worldwide network volumes for the year increased percent compared to the prior year percent on an fxadjusted basis billed business which represented percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results increased percent yearoveryear percent on an fxadjusted basis demonstrating our continued ability to acquire engage and retain highspending premium card members us consumer billed business grew by percent yearoveryear reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium us consumer card members billed business in our commercial services segment grew by percent on a yearoveryear basis reflecting continued growth from us small and midsized enterprise customers as well as continued steady recovery in spending by our us large and global corporate clients international billed business grew by percent yearoveryear percent on an fxadjusted basis driven by a strong recovery in spend across both consumer and commercial customers te spending momentum remained strong throughout the year while yearoveryear goods services spending growth slowed towards the end of the year following the large pandemic recovery growth rates experienced earlier in the year inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth while the continuing strengthening of the us dollar relative to the prior year against most major currencies in which we operate had a negative impact on our international billings total revenues net of interest expense increased percent yearoveryear percent on an fxadjusted basis reflecting strong growth in all our revenue lines discount revenue our largest revenue line increased percent yearoveryear driven primarily by the momentum in our card member spending volumes throughout net card fees increased percent year overyear as new card acquisitions reached record levels in and card member retention remained high demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions service fees and other revenues increased percent yearoveryear driven in part by higher travelrelated revenues net interest income increased percent versus the prior year primarily driven by growth in card member loans while the rising interest rate environment had a fairly neutral impact on our results for the full year rising rates did have a modest negative impact on net interest income towards the end of the year card member loans increased percent yearoveryear with the majority of growth coming from existing card members and was driven by ongoing strong growth in billed business which began to moderate towards the end of the year as we lapped the steep phase of recovery provisions for credit losses increased versus the prior year reflecting a reserve build of million compared with a reserve release of billion in the prior year and are expected to increase in while delinquency and net writeoff rates continued to increase throughout the year these metrics remain strong supported by the premium nature of our customer base our risk management capabilities and risk actions we took throughout the year the foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into us dollars ie assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared fxadjusted revenues is a non gaap measure we believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates card member rewards card member services and business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage and increased yearover year due to network volume growth and higher usage of travelrelated benefits card member rewards expense growth was also driven by a larger proportion of billed business in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel during the year we continued to make significant investments in marketing to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions operating expenses increased percent yearoveryear primarily driven by net losses in the current year associated with our amex ventures equity investments as compared to net gains in the prior year as well as higher compensation costs due to an increase in our colleague base to support business growth and compensation decisions we made we remain focused on driving marketing and operating expense efficiencies while continuing to invest in our growth strategy during the year we returned billion of capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases and dividend payments while maintaining our common equity tier cet1 capital ratio within our target range of to percent we plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while

to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels at american express or our us bank subsidiary american express national bank aenb could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the

requirements specifically within a to percent target range for american express companys common equity tier cet1 riskbased capital ratio we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can affect the capital and liquidity positions at the american express parent company level or at our subsidiaries we report our capital ratios using the basel iii capital definitions

return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases the share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and generally more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans during the year ended december we returned billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of billion and share repurchases of billion we repurchased million common shares at an average price of in these dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately percent of total capital generated during the year we plan to increase the regular quarterly dividend on our common shares outstanding by approximately percent from  to  per share beginning with the first quarter dividend declaration in addition during the year ended december we paid million in dividends on noncumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our preferred shares our decisions on capital distributions depend on various factors including our capital levels and regulatory capital requirements regulatory guidance or restrictions actual and forecasted business results economic and market conditions revisions to or revocation of the federal reserves authorization of our capital plan and the supervisory stress test process we may conduct share repurchases through a variety of methods including open market purchases 10b51 plans privately negotiated transactions including employee benefit plans or other purchases including block trades accelerated share repurchase programs or any combination of such methods as market conditions warrant and at prices we deem appropriate funding strategy our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and welldiversified funding sources to allow us to finance our global businesses and to maintain a strong liquidity profile our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our assetliability management activities we have in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of our subsidiaries our global proprietary cardissuing businesses generate significant assets in both domestic and international card member lending and receivable activities our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary cardissuing businesses where we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by card members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period card member loans and receivables are outstanding in addition we maintain a liquidity position to meet regulatory requirements and support our business activities we aim to satisfy these financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources the diversity of funding sources by type of instrument by tenor and by investor base among other factors mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument tenor or investor we seek to achieve diversity and cost efficiency in our funding sources by maintaining scale and market relevance in deposits unsecured debt and asset securitizations and access to secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility we expect the balance of our direct deposits to continue to grow our funding plan is primarily driven by the size and mix of business asset growth our liquidity position and choice of funding sources as well as cash requirements generated by the redemptions of deposits by our customers the maturities of debt outstanding and related interest payments in executing our funding plan we aim to maintain a balanced debt maturity profile with an appropriate mix of shortterm and longterm refinancing requirements funding programs and activities we had the following customer deposits and consolidated debt outstanding as of december table summary of customer deposits and consolidated debt table start billions customer deposits shortterm borrowings longterm debt total customer deposits and debt table end we may redeem from time to time certain debt securities prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities our funding plan for the full year includes among other sources approximately billion to billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately billion to billion of secured term debt issuance actual funding activities can vary from our plans due to various factors such as future business growth the impact of global economic political and other events on market capacity and funding needs demand for securities offered by us regulatory changes ability to securitize and sell loans and receivables and the performance of loans and receivables previously sold in securitization transactions many of these factors are beyond our control our equity capital and funding strategies are designed among other things to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the

are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of our securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused credit facilities declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of us retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to total funding should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs deposit programs we offer deposits within our us bank subsidiary aenb these funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least per account holder through the fdic our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on among other factors the capital level of aenb direct retail deposits offered by aenb is our primary deposit product channel which makes fdicinsured highyield savings

liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and offbalance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios and establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet liquidity sources including cash and other liquid assets committed bank credit facilities and secured borrowing facilities through our us bank subsidiary aenb we also hold collateral eligible for use at the federal reserves discount window the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy these stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics varying by cash flow assumptions time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources among other factors scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include marketwide firmspecific and combined liquidity stresses we consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain such as economic and financial market conditions seasonality in business operations growth in our businesses potential acquisitions or dispositions the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements the investment income we receive on liquidity resources has historically been less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances the level of future net interest income or costs depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields securitized borrowing capacity as of december we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii the charge trust we also maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of september which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the american express credit account master trust the lending trust both facilities are used in the ordinary course of

be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve as of december we had approximately billion in us credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria committed bank credit facility in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above as of december we maintained a committed syndicated

restrictions in relation to either accessing the facility or distributing capital to common shareholders in the event our cet1 riskbased capital ratio falls between percent and percent it does not contain a material adverse change clause which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the facility nor is it dependent on our credit rating as of december we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit facility and no amounts were drawn on the facility we use this facility from time to time in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs any undrawn portion of this facility could serve as a backstop for the amount of commercial paper outstanding offbalance sheet arrangements we have certain offbalance sheet obligations that include guarantees

defines our risk appetite governance culture and capabilities the implementation and execution of the erm program is headed by our chief risk officer risk management is overseen by our board of directors through three board committees the risk committee the audit and compliance committee and the compensation and benefits committee each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the full board regarding matters reviewed at their committee the committees meet regularly in private sessions with our chief risk officer the chief compliance officer the

risk appetite it maintains the enterprisewide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it the ermc oversees implementation of risk policies companywide the ermc reviews key risk exposures trends and concentrations significant compliance matters and provides guidance on the steps to monitor control and report major risks in addition the asset liability committee chaired by our chief financial officer is responsible for managing our capital funding and liquidity investment market risk and assetliability activities in accordance with our policies and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements as defined in the erm policy we follow the three lines of defense approach to risk management the first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking the chief executive officer business unit presidents and the chief financial officer are part of the first line of defense the second line comprises independent functions overseeing risktaking activities of the first line the chief risk officer the chief compliance officer the chief operational risk officer and certain control groups both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities are part of the second line of defense the global risk oversight team oversees the policies strategies frameworks models processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks our internal audit group constitutes the third line of defense and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense credit risk management process we define credit risk as loss due to default or changes in the credit quality of a customer obligor or security our credit risks are divided into two broad categories individual and institutional each has distinct risk management capabilities strategies and tools business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams each led by a chief credit officer individual credit risk individual credit risk arises from consumer and small business charge cards credit cards and term loans these portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies industries and levels of net worth we benefit from the highquality profile of our customers which is driven by our brand premium customer servicing product features and risk management capabilities which span underwriting customer management and collections the risk in these portfolios is generally correlated to broad economic trends such as unemployment rates and gross domestic product gdp growth the business unit leaders and their chief credit officers take the lead in managing the credit risk process these chief credit officers are guided by the individual credit risk committee icrc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the individual credit risk management policy the icrc ensures compliance with ermc guidelines and procedures and escalates to the ermc as appropriate credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decisionmaking models that use uptodate information on prospects and customers such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus we have developed datadriven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers institutional credit risk institutional credit risk arises principally within our cs ics and gmns businesses as well as investment and liquidity management activities unlike individual credit risk institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity it is affected both by general economic conditions and by clientspecific events the absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios similar to individual credit risk business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by chief credit officers these officers are guided by the institutional risk management committee irmc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the institutional credit risk management policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures the committee along with the business unit chief credit officers makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights for risk mitigation monitors risk exposures and determines risk mitigation actions the irmc formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ermc guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ermc as appropriate at the same time the irmc provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize riskadjusted returns on capital a centralized risk rating unit provides risk assessment of our institutional obligors exposure to the airline and travel industry we have multiple important cobrand rewards merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines the erm program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines and the travel industry more broadly including cruise lines travel agencies and tour operators our largest airline partner is delta and this relationship includes an exclusive cobrand credit card partnership and other arrangements including membership rewards redemption merchant acceptance travel and corporate payments see we face intense competition for partner relationships which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business we are exposed to risks associated with our business partners including reputational issues business slowdowns bankruptcies liquidations restructurings and consolidations and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners under risk factors for additional information debt exposure as part of our ongoing risk management process we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign customers and counterparties and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions as well as by economic sectors and industries a primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles we evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk as of december we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material operational risk management process we consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to among other things inadequate or failed processes people or information systems or impacts from the external environment including failures to comply with laws and regulations as well as impacts from relationships with third parties operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss brand damage customer dissatisfaction or legal and regulatory penalties to appropriately measure and manage operational risk we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the operational risk management policy approved by the ermc the operational risk management committee ormc chaired by the chief operational risk officer coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls it also oversees the preventive responsive and mitigation efforts by operational excellence teams in the business units and staff groups we use the operational risk framework to identify measure monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks this framework supervised by the ormc consists of a operational risk event capture b a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements c key risk indicators and d process and entitylevel risk assessments the framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes impact to customers andor us and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect remediate customers and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues the impact is assessed from an operational financial brand regulatory compliance and legal perspective information and cyber security we define information and cyber security risk as the risk that a security incident could impact the confidentiality integrity or availability of american express customer colleague or proprietary information our information and cyber security program is designed to protect information systems from unauthorized access use disclosure disruption modification or destruction the program is built upon a foundation of advanced security technology a wellstaffed and highly trained team of experts and operations based on the national institute of standards and technology cybersecurity framework this consists of controls designed to identify protect detect respond and recover from information and cyber security incidents we continue to invest in enhancements to cyber security capabilities and engage in industry and government forums to promote advancements to the broader financial services cyber security ecosystem see a major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services under risk factors for additional information information technology we define information technology risk as the risk that events or circumstances could compromise the processing stability capacity performance or resilience of information technology and cause financial reputational andor regulatory impacts we manage information technology risk through our policies procedures governance structure and control framework to preserve the confidentiality integrity and availability of systems and processes

governance andor data management practices adversely impacting the accuracy completeness timeliness comprehensiveness or usability of data throughout its lifecycle our enterprise data governance policy establishes the framework for defining inscope critical data and the requirements for managing such data effectively throughout its lifecycle as a critical corporate asset this policy is approved by the ermc chaired by the chief data officer our enterprise data committee a subcommittee of the ermc provides governance and oversight for our enterprisewide data governance and management activities third party risk we define third party risk as the risk that relationships with third parties including their significant subcontractors create unexpected outcomes and deviations from expectations or stated obligations the third party management policy is approved by the risk committee of our board and the ermc it sets forth the procurement risk management and contracting framework for managing thirdparty relationships commensurate with their risk and complexity our third party lifecycle management program sets guidelines for identifying measuring monitoring and reporting the risk associated with third parties through the life cycle of the relationships which includes planning due diligence and thirdparty selection contracting ongoing monitoring and termination conduct risk we define conduct risk as the risk that colleagues intentionally or unintentionally fail to fulfill their responsibilities to american express our customers colleagues or stakeholders in a manner consistent with our code of conduct policies and values as well as applicable laws and regulations conduct issues also have the potential to increase several other risk types including reputational risk which may undermine the integrity and trust upon which our brand is built the conduct risk management policy is approved by the ermc it establishes the governance framework for conduct risk across the company the policy requires annual risk assessments implementation of detective and preventive controls colleague training and timely escalations of conduct issues it also provides guidance on consequence management for any substantiated cases of misconduct the conduct risk committee oversees conduct risk related topics and escalates such matters to the ermc as appropriate compliance risk management process we define compliance risk as the risk of legal or reputational harm fines monetary penalties and payment of damages or other forms of sanction as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws andor regulations internal policies and procedures and related practices or ethical standards we view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk as an important aspect of our business model our global compliance and ethics organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporatewide compliance risk management program pursuant to this program we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing controlling monitoring measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risks to which we are exposed the compliance risk management committee crmc chaired by the chief compliance officer is responsible for identifying evaluating managing and escalating compliance risks the crmc has a dual reporting relationship directly to both the ermc and the audit and compliance committee we have a comprehensive antimoney laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities the program includes an independent risk assessment of the rules used by the antimoney laundering team in addition the internal audit group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance reputational risk management process we define reputational risk as the risk that negative stakeholder reaction to our products services client and partner relationships business activities and policies management and workplace culture or our response to unexpected events could cause sustained critical media coverage a decline in revenue or investment talent attrition litigation or government or regulatory scrutiny we view protecting our reputation for excellent customer service trust security and high integrity as core to our vision of providing the worlds best customer experience and fundamental to our longterm success our business leaders are responsible for considering the reputational risk implications of business activities and strategies and ensuring the relevant subject matter experts are engaged as needed the ermc is responsible for ensuring reputational risk considerations are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policies and committees and properly reflected in all decisions escalated to the ermc market risk management process we define market risk as the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices our market risk exposures include i interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between the interest rates on our assets such as loans receivables and investment securities and the interest rates on our liabilities such as debt and deposits and ii foreign exchange risk related to transactions funding investments and earnings in currencies other than the us dollar our risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management including quantitative limits and escalation triggers these policies are approved by the ermc asset liability committee or market risk management committee market risk is managed by the market risk management committee the market risk oversight officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and asset liability management activities as well as overseeing compliance with associated regulatory requirements market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments funding liquidity and investments interest rate risk we analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets liabilities and the economic value of equity our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of among other things the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixedrate debt and deposits compared to our card member loans and receivables interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to variablerate from fixedrate or vice versa refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments as of december a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact of approximately million on our annual net interest income this measure first projects net interest income over the following twelvemonth time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates the detrimental impact from rate changes is then measured by instantaneously increasing or decreasing the anticipated future interest rates by basis points our estimated repricing risk assumes that our interestrate sensitive assets and liabilities that reprice within the twelvemonth horizon generally reprice by the same magnitude subject to applicable interest rate caps or floors as benchmark rates change it is further assumed that within our interestrate sensitive liabilities certain deposits reprice at lower magnitudes than benchmark rate movements and the magnitude of this repricing in turn depends on among other factors the direction of rate movements these assumptions are consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates foreign exchange risk foreign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways card member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency crosscurrency transactions and balances from our funding activities crosscurrency investing activities such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries and revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies which impact earnings these foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur as of december foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately billion were outstanding with respect to card member spending and crosscurrency transactions including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding the impact of a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar would have been immaterial to projected earnings as of december with respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of december with respect to anticipated earnings denominated in foreign currencies for the next twelve months the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar would be approximately million as of december to a much lesser extent we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our foreign exchange international payments business we aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging where appropriate and the establishment of limits the actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on among other factors the timing of rate changes the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree changes in the cost volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses funding liquidity risk management process we define funding and liquidity risk as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations at a reasonable cost as they become due our boardapproved liquidity risk policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management funding and liquidity risk is managed by the funding and liquidity committee to manage this risk we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of cash readilymarketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelvemonth period in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions we consider the tradeoffs between maintaining too much liquidity which can be costly and limit financial flexibility and having inadequate liquidity which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event funding and liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained the funding and liquidity committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken model risk management process we define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences such as financial loss poor business and strategic decision making damage to our reputation or customer harm from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and outcomes the enterprisewide model risk policy establishes the comprehensive framework for governing model risk this policy is approved by the ermc the comprehensive risk management and governance framework includes procedures for model development independent model validation model risk reporting and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology outputs and misuse we also assess model performance and model related issues on an ongoing basis and seek to address deficiencies in a timely manner in addition we utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning aiml models for a variety of business use cases we perform extensive reviews and testing to reduce the risk that these aiml techniques result in adverse consequences strategic and business risk management process we define strategic and business risk as the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions including decisions related to mergers acquisitions and divestitures poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies we seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders mergers acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following executive committee due diligence a comprehensive risk assessment by operational market credit and oversight leaders provided to the chief risk officer and approval by either the chief risk officer or appropriate risk committees all new and material changes to products and services are reviewed and approved by the new products committee and appropriate credit or risk committees country risk management process we define country risk as the risk that economic social andor political conditions and events in a country present they might adversely impact us primarily as a result of greater credit losses increased operational or market risk or the inability to repatriate capital we manage country risk as part of the normal course of business policies and procedures establish country risk escalation thresholds to control and limit exposure driven by processes that enable the monitoring of conditions in countries where we have exposure environmental social and governance esg and climaterelated risk we define climaterelated risk as risks related to the transition to a lowcarbon economy which may include extensive changes pertaining to policy legal technology market and reputational risks and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change typically driven by acute physical risk such as increased severity of extreme weather events eg cyclones hurricanes floods and chronic physical risk which are longerterm shifts in climate patterns eg sea level rise chronic heat waves such transition and physical risk events driven by climate change can have broad impact on our customers operations suppliers and business climaterelated risk is interconnected and overarching across all risk types as it may manifest as credit risk operational risk market risk liquidity risk or other risk types we continue to enhance our focus on climaterelated risk within our risk governance framework we are currently performing a risk identification process for climaterelated risk to determine the meaningfulness and measurability of the risk furthermore esg risks with an emphasis on climaterelated risk are currently identified as an emerging risk within our risk governance framework critical accounting estimates refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows reserves for card member credit losses reserves for card member credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date the cecl methodology which became effective january requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period rs period beyond the balance sheet date in estimating expected credit losses we use a combination of statistically based models and analysis of the results produced by these models to determine the quantitative and qualitative components of our total balance sheet reserves for credit losses these quantitative and qualitative components entail a significant amount of judgment the primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate rs period the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions we use these models and assumptions combined with historical loss experience to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balances to produce our reserves for expected credit losses for the rs period the qualitative component is intended to capture expected losses that may not have been fully captured in the quantitative component through an established governance structure we consider certain external and internal factors including emerging portfolio characteristics and trends which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserves for card member credit losses the rs period which is approximately three years represents the maximum timeperiod beyond the balance sheet date over which we can reasonably estimate expected credit losses using all available portfolio information current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions card member loan products do not have a contractual term and balances can revolve if minimum required payments are made causing some balances to remain outstanding beyond the rs period to determine expected credit losses beyond the rs period we immediately revert to longterm average loss rates card member receivable products are contractually required to be paid in full therefore we have assumed the balances will be either paid or writtenoff no later than days past due within the rs period our models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default a significant area of judgment relates to how we apply future card member payments to the reporting period balances when determining the exposure at default the nature of revolving loan products inherently includes a relationship between future payments and spend behavior which creates complexity in the application of how future payments are either partially or entirely attributable to the existing balance at the end of the reporting period using historical customer behavior and other factors we have assumed that future payments are first allocated to interest and fees associated with the reporting period balance and future spend we then allocate a portion of the payment to the estimated higher minimum payment amount due because of any future spend any remaining portion of the future payment is then allocated to the remaining reporting period balance cecl requires that the rs period include an assumption about current and future economic conditions we incorporate multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party the estimated credit losses calculated from each macroeconomic scenario are reviewed each period and weighted to reflect managements judgment about uncertainty surrounding these scenarios these macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables including unemployment rates and real gdp that are significant to our models macroeconomic sensitivity to demonstrate the sensitivity of estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios we compared our modeled estimates under a baseline scenario to that under a pessimistic downside scenario as of december for every percentage points change in weighting from the baseline scenario to the pessimistic downside scenario the estimated credit losses increased by approximately million the modeled estimates under these scenarios were influenced by the duration severity and timing of changes in economic variables within each scenario and these macroeconomic scenarios under different conditions or using different assumptions could result in significantly different estimated credit losses it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the estimated credit losses and current results may not be indicative of the potential future impact of macroeconomic forecast changes in addition this sensitivity analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates under two scenarios without considering managements judgment on the relative weighting for those and other scenarios including the weight that has been placed on the downside scenario at the balance sheet date or any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative reserve component or the impact of management judgment for the qualitative reserve component which may have a positive or negative effect on the results thus the results of this sensitivity analysis are hypothetical and are not intended to estimate or reflect our expectations of any changes in the overall reserves for credit losses due to changes in the macroeconomic environment refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the range of macroeconomic scenario key variables used in conjunction with other inputs described above to calculate reserves for card member credit losses the process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment to the extent our expected credit loss models are not indicative of future performance actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for credit losses in any period liability for membership rewards the membership rewards program is our largest cardbased rewards program card members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products a significant portion of our cards by their terms allow card members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories membership rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards including but not limited to travel shopping gift cards and covering eligible charges points typically do not expire and there is no limit on the number of points a card member may earn membership rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners we record a membership rewards liability that represents our best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by card members in the future the membership rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels attrition the volume of points earned and redeemed and the associated redemption costs we estimate the membership rewards liability by determining the urr and the weighted average cost wac per point which are applied to the points of current enrollees refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the urr assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods we use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the urr of points earned to date by current card members based on redemption trends card product type enrollment tenure card spend levels and credit attributes the wac per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by card members reward offerings by partners and membership rewards program changes the wac per point assumption is derived from months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns we periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns cost per point redeemed partner contract changes and other factors the process of estimating the membership rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates resulting in either higher or lower membership rewards expense changes in the membership rewards urr and wac per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period membership rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period as of december an increase in the estimated urr of current enrollees of basis points would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately million similarly an increase in the wac per point of basis point would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately million goodwill recoverability goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise such as adverse changes in the business climate that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment we have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the qualitative factors may include but are not limited to economic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unitspecific events if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment we could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit bypassing the qualitative assessment our methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units which inherently entails the use of significant management judgment for valuation we use a combination of the income approach discounted cash flows and market approach market multiples in estimating the fair value of our reporting units when preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach we estimate future cash flows using the reporting units internal multiyear forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions to discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity determined using a capital asset pricing model when using the market method under the market approach we apply comparable publicly traded companies multiples eg earnings revenues to our reporting units operating results the judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows discount rates and market comparables is significant and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units we could be exposed to an increased risk of goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from managements current assumptions income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayers facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing a provision for income tax expense we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws unrecognized tax benefits we establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements in establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit assumptions may be made in determining whether and the extent to which a tax position should be sustained a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on its technical merits the amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement as new information becomes available we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits as appropriate tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax deferred tax asset realization deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the consolidated financial statements certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies these assessments are performed quarterly taking into account any new information changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties other matters as previously disclosed we identified during an internal review that over time certain current and former us card members with multiple cards were not credited certain membership rewards points that they had earned we completed our review of this matter in
