capital markets due to a variety of factors and manage our balance sheet to reflect evolving circumstances capital we believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on riskadjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income and other sources such as the issuance of subordinated debt and preferred shares as well as the exercise of stock options by colleagues to maintain a strong balance sheet provide flexibility to support future business growth and distribute

capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of us direct deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to total funding should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs on august the us federal bank regulatory agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that if adopted as proposed would require covered bank holding companies such as american express company to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible external longterm debt and

of june and december we had billion and billion in cash and cash equivalents respectively refer to the cash flows section below for a discussion of the major drivers impacting cash flows for the six months ended june the investment income we receive on liquidity resources has historically been less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances from time to time including in this quarter interest income may exceed the interest expense associated with the liquidity portfolio depending on the interest rate environment our funding composition and the amount of liquidity resources we maintain the level of future net interest income or expense associated with our liquidity resources will vary securitized borrowing capacity as of june we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii the

stockbased compensation deferred taxes and other noncash items and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments in the net cash provided by operating activities was driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating liabilities primarily driven by higher book overdrafts due to timing differences arising in the ordinary course of business in the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for

partially offset by share repurchases and dividend payments other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments supervision regulation we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial the financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governments and regulators are increasingly requiring financial services firms and payment systems to be locally licensed andor to localize aspects of their operations compliance programs and governance frameworks the development and enforcement of these and other similar laws regulations and policies may increase our operational complexity and compliance costs result in enforcement actions and penalties and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network governmental authorities have also focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms and payment systems with laws and regulations and as a result we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures reviews by us and governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies including errors or misconduct by colleagues or third parties or control failures have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination we have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations for example as previously disclosed we are cooperating with governmental investigation s related to our historical sales practices which are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in addition various bank regulators have announced they are reviewing credit card rewards programs for compliance with certain consumer protection laws and regulations as previously disclosed we identified during an internal review that certain us card members were not credited certain membership rewards points they had earned and we have taken actions to remediate it and enhance our related procedures we are cooperating with regulators in their ongoing regulatory examination of rewards and benefits programs external publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further regulatory in quiries please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the form 10k for further information enhanced prudential standards we are subject to the us federal bank regulatory agencies rules that tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions with billion or more in total consolidated assets under these rules american express company and its depository

institution becoming a category iii firm please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the form 10k for further information resolution planning on june the fdic issued a final rule amending its resolution plan requirements for insured depository institutions the final rule requires insured depository institutions with billion or more in assets that are not affiliated with us global systematically important banking organizations including aenb to submit full resolution plans every three years with interim supplements in nonsubmission years under the final rule resolution plans are subject to more stringent standards with respect to their assumptions and content as well as enhanced credibility standards for the fdics evaluation of resolution plans and expanded expectations regarding engagement and capabilities testing the final rule is effective on october and provides that the due date for the first resolution plan or interim supplement for insured depository institutions such as aenb will be no earlier than june consumer financial products regulation our consumeroriented activities are subject to regulation and supervision in the united states and internationally in the united states our marketing sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in addition a number of us states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than us federal laws us federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny on march the cfpb issued a final rule that lowers the safe harbor amount for credit card late fees that would be considered to be reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by credit card issuers for late payments to eliminates a higher late fee safe harbor amount for subsequent late payments and eliminates the annual inflation adjustment for the safe harbor amou nt on may a preliminary injunction was granted staying the effectiveness of the final rule however whether the final rule will ultimately be implemented will depend on the outcome of the ongoing litigation if the rule were to go into effect in the absence of providing a cost justification to support a late fee higher than the safe harbor amount which would be permissible under the final rule we would be required to reduce our late fees resulting in a decrease to our delinquency fee revenue in addition a reduction in the late fee amount could alter card member behavior and impact repayment rates for

legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad regulatory regimes for payment systems

impact various aspects of network operations or contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance regulation and other governmental actions relating to operations pricing or practices could affect all networks andor acquirers directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants for example we exited our network business in the eu and australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions in addition there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the eu

provisions in circumstances where threeparty networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent although the ruling provided only limited guidance as to when or how the provisions might apply in such circumstances and remains subject to differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements on august the dutch trade and industry appeals tribunal referred
