year as you know the fed interest rate cuts in are a headwind and yesterday the fed said that interest rates remain unchanged as january comes to a close equity markets remain strong but with a pickup in volatility we cannot predict the year or market cycles but with deep client relationships good cash flows and a strong balance sheet ameriprise is built to manage these cycles and emerge stronger now lets discuss the quarter on a consolidated level fourth quarter results were quite good compared to a year ago on an adjusted operating basis we delivered revenue growth of excluding auto home revenue in the yearago period solid eps growth up even after absorbing some additional expenses in corporate a return on equity of ex aoci and unlocking which remains well above many peers and with the sale of the auto home business we generated million in net benefit on a full year gaap pretax basis our assets under management and administration reached a new high up to billion we also achieved new records in wealth management for retail client assets and advisor productivity that ill discuss further with that lets now turn to our growth engine advice wealth management we delivered solid

advice wealth management including some nice fourth quarter highlights client assets were up our feebased advisory business continues to stand out with more than billion of inflows into advisory in the quarter this brings total wrap assets to billion a increase importantly we had strong client acquisition results in the quarter particularly in our affluent target market and we saw good pickup in transactional activity as more clients engaged with us in financial planning relationships and in the quarter advisor productivity increased as advisors leverage the extensive support we offer to help them grow in recruiting we had another good year we continue to attract experienced advisors from across the industry in addition another advisors joined us and its one of the best quarters for recruiting large production practices whats behind our continued success the deep longlasting relationships we work diligently indiscernible with clients and were using a goalbased advice expertise and our enhanced client experience to deepen these relationships even further were also leveraging our recent investments to drive future growth here are some updates we continue to increase uptake of our digitallyenabled advice experience to even more clients we completed the rollout of our custom advisory relationship program we finished the conversion of our new customer relationship management

will continue to bring sweep deposits on the balance sheet this year we will be adding additional capabilities including a mortgage program pledge loans and a savings deposit product i also like to point out that outside of the bank ameriprise wealth management expenses will come back to more normalized levels in we also continue to receive important recognition in the industry ameriprise was recently certified by jd power for providing an outstanding customer service experience our teams work hard to deliver industryleading service so this means a lot ill leave you with this takeaway with our advice value proposition and the investments weve made we have a great opportunity to continue to grow in the wealth management business im energized by the opportunity we have in front of us now i will turn to our ia businesses these are strong books that provide earnings diversification and stability were focused on delivering insurance and annuity solutions that satisfy client needs while continuing to evolve our solution mix in the quarter we generated million in adjusted operating earnings for the protection and annuity businesses in line with our expectations and we continue to generate strong free cash flow in terms of annuity sales total variable annuity cash sales were up when compared to a slower quarter last year and for the year sales were in our typical range of about billion this month we launched our structured solutions annuity product designed exclusively to meet the needs of ameriprise clients we expect this will help shift even more of our books away from products with guarantees fixed annuity sales were down yearoveryear in line with our plan in protection we focused on continuing to shift from iul to vul where we had a very strong growth in vul sales compared to last year overall life ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 insurance in force remained stable at billion as always were focused on managing risks appropriately and ensuring we have the right product designs for our clients and the environment we will also continue to evaluate further action regarding reinsuring the remaining fixed annuity block this year moving to asset management earnings were strong and flows continued to improve we remain focused on serving client needs and pursuing longterm growth opportunities in key areas columbia threadneedle ended the quarter with billion in assets under management up on improving flows and positive markets and the earnings contribution to ameriprise remained good were making good progress executing on our strategy and you can see that in our flow picture we generated billion in net inflows in the quarter which was up billion from last year this is our third consecutive quarter of improved flows investment performance was excellent in across equities fixed income and asset allocation portfolios on an assetweighted basis for our columbia funds over are above median for one three and fiveyear time frames for threadneedle funds over are beating their benchmarks for those same time periods and were seeing improved results across strategies and regions with global retail leading the way in us retail we have been increasing our market share at six of our top eight brokerdealer partner firms and gross sales in our key strategies are good our equity flow rate in the quarter was strong in fact of the active firms we benchmarked we were in the top five and one of the few that were net positive for the quarter and in fixed income we continue to garner good flows and we feel that we can improve even further were seeing a particular strength in our income franchise for example our dividend income strategic income and mortgage opportunity funds generated more than billion in combined net inflows in the quarter in emea retail with brexit now moving forward and reduced uncertainty in the uk sentiment in europe has improved net flows improved by more than billion from last year were making good progress in fact we were net inflows in nearly all of our key markets in europe now that we have built out our ccap product range and in global institutional net inflows improved by more than billion ex parent to a net outflow of billion were gaining traction in a number of areas that we talked to you about in november it was another good quarter in asset management we have a strong product lineup excellent performance and global reach and were focused on executing well to maintain our momentum now let me turn to our final key area of focus our capital strength which is outstanding last quarter i highlighted our strong excess capital position and the benefits of the successful sale of the auto home business in terms of freeing up capital and focusing our efforts on our core businesses ultimately we ended the year at billion of excess capital in the fourth quarter as a continuation of our strong return of capital we returned of operating earnings through the pickup in the pace of our buyback and for the year we reduced our overall share count by to summarize it was an excellent quarter and year for ameriprise were in a strong position later this year will mark our 15th anniversary as an independent publiclytraded company were incredibly proud of what weve accomplished importantly were proud of how were recognized for our client service our records of outperformance and how we consistently deliver for shareholders were poised and energized to build on our record of performance and growth now walter will discuss the financials in detail and then well take your questions walter ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 walter stanley berman chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc thank you jim ameriprise delivered another strong quarter of financial results and business metrics with adjusted operating eps up to this was supported by strong revenue growth excluding the auto home business that we sold in the quarter the quality of earnings across our businesses was quite strong however within the corporate segment there were a few timingrelated expense items that id like to explain first we incurred higher than normal impairments in our low income housing portfolio totaling million the portfolio continues to perform well and we do not anticipate any impact to our going forward expected tax benefits second as part of our reengineering process and evaluation of our overall expense base going into we took an elevated level of severance charges in the quarter of million this action positions us well moving into finally we had significant share price appreciation in the quarter which required us to marktomarket some of the previously issued sharebased compensation awards this was a million absolute impact in the quarter but an million variance yearoveryear going forward we expect our corporate segment losses to return to the million range on october we closed the sale of auto home to american family the transaction generated a net benefit of million over the course of the year but is not recognized within our operating results we returned of earnings to shareholders in the quarter and for the year based upon the sale of auto home and the changes in our risk profile we entered with strong balance sheet fundamentals with billion in excess capital and a lower risk profile with long term care continuing to perform well which you can see in the appendix in we will evaluate reducing leverage while remaining committed to return capital at a pace of plus lets turn to page as i mentioned adjusted operating net revenue was up to billion after excluding auto home from the prioryear period revenue growth was driven by advice wealth management and asset management in advice wealth management we had a substantial increase in wrap assets and improved transactional activity driving an increase in revenue in asset management revenues grew including strong performance fees annuities and protection revenue was essentially flat in summary we delivered strong eps growth of and a return on equity of nearly turning to slide you can see that our business mix continues to evolve with advice wealth management generating over half of the companys earnings up from five years ago this profitability improvement has been driven by fundamental organic growth and well managed expenses while still investing for future growth weve seen a consistent shift in our business mix over the past few years and expect this to continue as we focus substantial investments in areas of opportunity within wealth management business advice wealth management continues to perform well across leading and lagging indicators as you can see on slide advice wealth management adjusted operating net revenues grew wrap assets were up to billion with net inflows of billion in the quarter transactional activity also increased yearoveryear we had a good quarter for experienced advisor recruiting with advisors joining us from other firms in the quarter with much higher trailing 12month productivity and marketlevels improved nicely pretax adjusted operating earnings were up or million in the face of a million headwind related to recent fed rate cuts a strong increase in revenue allowed us to continue to drive profitable growth despite short ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 term interest rates ga increased excluding the bank consistent with expectations we are continuing to make substantial investments for growth and seeing elevated volumerelated expenses given strong activity levels our expectation is that ga growth excluding the bank will be in the range of to finally our margin was solid at and we expect we can maintain it in this range lets turn to asset management on page in the quarter we saw a substantial billion improvement with net inflows of billion excluding former parentrelated flows net inflows were billion benefiting from continued improvement in retail in north america and europe as well as from reinvested dividends from a financial perspective the business is demonstrating an improved trajectory asset management continues to generate substantial revenue and pretax adjusted operating earnings for ameriprise pretax adjusted operating revenue was up to million driven by strong performance fees and market appreciation with lower pressure from the cumulative impact of flows underlying expenses remain well managed within the quarter expenses were impacted by elevated performance fee and yearend timingrelated compensation adjustments as well as a higher distribution expense associated with revenue growth margins in the quarter were remaining in our target range of to turning to page results in annuities and protection are solid annuities continued to perform in line with expectations with very consistent profitability we saw good improvement in variable annuity sales up in the quarter though still down for the full year we have launched a new structured variable annuity product in the first quarter that will further diversify our offering away from living benefit features and our variable annuity net amount of risk still remains one of the lowest in the industry protection earnings were down slightly to million claims remained in line with expectations now lets move to balance sheet on slide we accelerated the pace of capital return to shareholders in with billion returned via buybacks and dividends this is a continuation of our longstanding track record of capital return in fact over the past years we have returned over billion to shareholders and reduced our diluted share count by approximately we continued to generate substantial free cash flow which along with excellent balance sheet fundamentals will support continued capital return we entered from a position of strength with billion of excess capital we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders assessing potential changes to our capital structure to best support our current business mix and evaluating additional reinsurance opportunities with that we will take your questions ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from andrew kligerman from credit suisse andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc hey good morning so im looking at the advisor count and youre at its roughly flattish with the last years number could you talk a little bit about your ability to grow that count going into and the productivity of those advisors i know revenue per advisor was up yearoveryear a lot of moving parts there so how do you see that evolving in as well james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so we think that the advisor count would probably pick up a bit as we go forward we actually netted out a number of advisors in the ipi area and others as we reformed them restructured that channel as well as in some of the central sites as we shifted things around but we actually feel good about the recruitment were actually focused a bit more on higher productivity and so the average productivity of the people who are leaving us are still much lower so we focus mainly on the growth of that productivity and the type of people were bringing in but i think the advisor count should probably pick up a bit more like we were doing more at the beginning part of the year and i feel good about the type of productivity were bringing in and the recruitment end and the ramping up of the people who are here andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it and staying on advice wealth fee rates they were around basis points by our calculation in the quarter and thats kind of versus the recent to 111basispoint range over the last two years or so and so i dont know is that a function of moving up market and why is that and where do you see the fees kind of shaking out in and james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so i think its part of the idea of us continuing now to bring in more clients at a little higher levels where then the rates get a bit lower as the asset levels managing are a bit higher and so thats actually its a good positive thing for us i mean our net inflow of client activity is pretty strong continues to be good and consistent and we are bringing in more clients and the more affluent and were probably going to embark on something this year to even focus a bit more even on the higher net worth channels so i think thats favorable for us andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it and one last quick one payout ratio in billion of excess capital could you get that ratio even higher in ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc we could but the answer is i think as jim said at the investor day were targeting at this stage plus but we are certainly monitoring that and evaluating it andrew as we do but certainly we have the generation capacity and well be evaluating that as we move forward andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks a lot operator our next question comes from humphrey lee with dowling partners humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc good morning and thank you for taking my questions a question related to the ga expenses i think in jim and walters prepared remarks you talked about expenses should normalize in and i think specifically in awm the ga expenses excluding the bank would be kind of to growth but i guess when we look at the overall enterprise how should we think about the expenses in general and then also how much of a bankingrelated expense do you anticipate for awm walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc okay so i think as we indicated yes i think what you said for awm the expense range after normalizing for the bank it would be in the to range as it relates to amp it is lower than that and it normally would be in the range of in that range so we anticipate that will continue as we look as we evaluate it but that is what is a reasonably good expectation humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc okay so including the bank or amp overall amp ga expenses would be in the range is that what youre suggesting walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc the bank will be above that because we normalize for it at the awm level its about basis points if you add for the bank so indiscernible itll be a little less for amp because of the amp size the expense base will be neutralized and indiscernible gives a little less impact but humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc okay walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc that is basically from that standpoint a normalized number ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc okay got it and then again in your prepared remarks you talked about the fixed annuity block it doesnt look like that the lower interest rate right now affects how you think about the block in terms of potential transactions is that a fair statement and then also can you remind us how much statutory capital that you have right now backing that business walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah so listen the interest rates do affect it but we do believe there is a were evaluating that there is potential viability and certainly pursuing fixed annuity reinsurance and were in discussions and we evaluate that just as a general range its probably around in the area of million to million that we can free up humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc okay great thank you operator our following question comes from kenneth lee from rbc capital markets kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi thanks for taking my question just one within the asset management business a followup on the prepared remarks you touched upon seeing improving investor sentiment within the uk emea region due to brexit clarity wondering whether you would expect to see further improvement in net fund flows this year due to the increase in clarity and perhaps you could just tell us which products investment products youre potentially gaining from this improving sentiment thanks james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc okay so i think youre more explicitly asking about uk and europe our emea business yes we saw a nice improvement bounceback occurring in the fourth quarter moving from some negative in the first month of the quarter to actually inflows in the second and third month of the quarter and we see that continuing europe was actually positive for us good the uk was still coming back but was still a bit weaker but we feel like that will start to change and ph remedying now that theyve gone through the elections at the end of the year so were reasonably optimistic that there ph would be with a little less uncertainty i mean theres still uncertainty to the extent of what is the trade agreement and things at the end of the year but the people in london are feeling better and feel like the business can come back there and the appetite would increase and we have a good lineup i mean we have excellent performance in our funds uk equitytype products are really good weve gained even in a negative year flows there and we now have a fuller line of products in the ccap range in europe and that bodes well for us as theres a pickup and were seeing that pick up in things like european equities and various things like that so were positive on that to be an improvement this year ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and just one followup if i may looking at the former parent companyrelated outflows looking back over the past year or so net outflows related to that have been declining just wondering whether we would expect a similar kind of trajectory going forward or just wanted to get your thoughts there thanks james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so i think weve seen some improvement in the domestic part of that and the outflow from our relationship here the zurich activity has been pretty consistent once in a while theyll have a pension that closes and theres some lumpiness but its pretty much been running like what weve seen from quartertoquarter just based on the drawdown of these closed books and assets but as i said the assets that remain there through a combination of appreciation and even some difference in some of the products that we replaced that have a bit higher fee the revenue gets offset even though the flow negatives in that book is there so but i would probably say its been running that way consistently for a while so i dont see much change there from a flow but the revenue has been pretty stable kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc very helpful thank you very much operator our following question comes from john barnidge from piper sandler john bakewell barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thanks deposit volume in for vas was the highest since thought it was somewhat surprising given the decline in rates during the year and associated repricing activity can you talk about your positioning in the distribution environment there thank you james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah we did see a bit more of a pickup i mean a year ago this quarter it was a slower period for us but we saw a bit more activity towards the end of the year we actually just in the end of this month we just launched our structured annuity product and we actually think that would pick up some traction as well in the current year and shift some of the business from the guarantee product i mean we still sell a reasonable portion of annuities without living benefits as well which is good so were not looking for substantial growth but were looking for probably a bit more growth but also a shift to now some of the structured product as well which is good for us so we want to keep that book growing or stable with slight growth which is good and the mix improving so thats what were probably seeing right now john bakewell barnidge q analyst piper sandler co oh great and my followup does brexit clarity change your view around ma for asset management as i believe the fee rate for retail is a bit higher in emea than in the us ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well we want to continue to grow in emea and europe to the point you referenced based on fee rates and the use of active as well so we keep our eye out for opportunities but we actually feel like some of the investments were making and the expansion of resources that were putting on the continent gives us some opportunity for further growth there as well john bakewell barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thanks for the answer operator our following question comes from tom gallagher from evercore thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi good morning just a question on the awm growth just looking at page of the supplement it looks like total client aum versus the wrap accounts is growing a bit slower just curious are you seeing outflows in the non wrap business and overall how is that impacting your growth in that business and just overall economics james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well looking at the client flows theyre still pretty very good so they are in excess of the billion i dont know exactly what the ins and outs theres some ins and outs but a shift between the nonwrap to wrap has slowed a lot i mean its sort of leveled out i cant tell you like from period to period it might be slight but the net of the effect of what those flows are are gross client net client inflows in total so its within that realm i would probably say with the fourth quarter with just the markets being where they were i probably think activity would slow it a little more for investment purposes just because people were waiting for the next shoe to drop but i think its been pretty stable thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi so jim just following up on that would you say overall flows into the complex from a total client assets would be close to the billion mark james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc its north of billion but in that range in the fourth quarter thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thats helpful and then how should we think about total capital return i mean i know youve returned more than the certainly last year youre sitting on substantial excess as we stand today how are you thinking about utilization of the excess are you thinking more strategic ma or are there opportunities out there and then maybe doing more buybacks if nothing if you dont find anything like where are you leaning now more toward with deployment of that excess particularly after the pnc capital freed a significant amount up ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so as you saw we did pick up the buyback as we said walter just mentioned that were probably looking to continue usually saying to were saying probably plus at this point in time not knowing the world and et cetera but if things present good opportunities for additional we do that but we constantly monitor the cash flow continues to be quite good and strong as walter also said were probably looking to reinsure some more as we go through the year so i think buyback still would be probably the main return mechanism we will look presenting to the board about a dividend increase again this year consistent with all the years that weve done that and we always look at some ma strategically to fit in but that depends on opportunities that may come along or not but we have enough capital flexibility that that should not affect our buyback trajectory thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thanks operator our following question comes from suneet kamath with citi suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks good morning just wanted to start with the awm margin so if the fed is on hold now is the impact of what they did last year in terms of rate cuts sort of fully baked into the margin walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yes basically it is small deviation but basically it is suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc and then at investor day i mean i dont want to nitpick here but you talked about a plus margin in awm on this call youre saying you could maintain at is there sort of a change in how youre thinking about that margin relative to what you told us at investor day walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc no not at all suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay and then the last one i had is on the bank i think we have a good sense of what the expenses are but can you give us a sense of what the bank revenues are and how you expect that to progress as we move through ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah so as we indicated we had a small profit in and we do expect with the launches of different products and adding more transfer of sweep money over the revenues will grow obviously this is a challenging market for investments but on that base we do see the revenues growing and us increasing our profitability in suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc do you have a sense of the revenue base though right now from the bank walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc let me i dont want to guess at it so let us get back to you and ill get it to you suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc all right thanks walter operator our following question comes from erik bass from autonomous research erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp hi thank you a couple of followups on advice wealth sort of along the same line as suneets questions i guess first would you expect cash yields to be pretty stable going forward if the fed remains on hold or are there any competitive dynamics that could create some noise there walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc no i dont believe that we see any obviously were constantly monitoring and measuring but no we dont see any at this time erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp got it and then morgan stanley recently provided a target of getting its wealth management business margins to the to range over the next two years and i realize there are differences between its business and yours but do you see getting to kind of a mid20 margin as something that may be achievable over the intermediate term as the bank reaches scale and if you continue to improve advisor productivity levels james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i would say this i mean one of the things very clearly is you have sort of compressed rates out there with what the fed recently did versus some of the banks that might have been started previously where based on their investments and other things like the wirehouses with their banking entities and the use of that but i would actually say if you get a bit better in some of the yield curve or some pickup a little better on some of the longer rates not substantially i think you can see with what were shifting into the bank with the development going ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 through the bank but that could be adding to margins even if the fed maintained rates right now so to speak depending on what happens in the larger climate but were ramping up the bank in a period when those things are pretty compressed erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp got it james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc but we do feel good about it because it gives us the opportunity if things normalize a little better again erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp got it thank you and is there a correlation between productivity and margin or does productivity just help drive revenues but kind of your payouts stay the same and its sort of marginneutral james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well the productivity over the years have definitely i mean you can see our margins have gone up pretty tremendously we do still have sort of an independent and an employee base the employee margins have increased nicely our independents are quite good and so we have added to margin based upon the productivity increase and the business growth and i dont see that changing substantially i think what were just managing is you had spurts in markets and other things so were just averaging that out right now but as walter said our expense growth should come down a bit outside of the bank back to more normalized levels so we feel good about maintaining and improving that margin over time but again things are with the environment you cant always predict that and what the impact may be in the short term erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp certainly thank you for the comments operator and the last question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey guys thanks for taking a couple of questions here i have a few on awm mostly so i guess first walter is it possible for you to give us a sense how much in net interest income you expect to generate at the bank in and sort of what that contemplates in other words are there more deposits youre going to move from sweep or whatever you move thats enough to kind of just put them into loans or other things you guys are doing at the bank its my first question walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 i guess let me first since we started the bank midyear obviously well get the calendarization effects so that indiscernible increase on that basis we will be increasing certainly as i indicated the sweep flows into the bank so that will but again as jim was saying in this market the rates are fairly constricted and we are certainly looking at launching and having more emphasis on our privileged loan program and certainly getting into a deposit program alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay but no rough sense of in terms of the revenue dollars you expect to get out of the bank this year walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc no not exactly again indiscernible were not forecasting but certainly there will be an increase and again were assuming an increase in profitability but i dont have the exact correlation i mean alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and alex were forming as weve started to ramp up the bank the shift in the sweep looking at the current environment and regarding both our lending and our investment strategy the rollout of some of the products this year we will be forming that and as that gets more informed we will be chatting with you and informing you as well so were just at the early stages of that but all the groundwork all the foundational elements even the initial shift in the launch of the credit card the initial sweeps et cetera have taken place so were right on track to our plans but the second level of that will be forming as we go in through this year alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks and then in terms of the asset growth so at a high level everything you guys are talking about sounds great in terms of recruiting higher productivity et cetera when we look at the wrap flows this year theyve decelerated versus last year despite the fact that what feels like has been a very robust environment for the industry as well as some of your peers so whats been driving the decline in wrap accounts this year what do you think is a reasonable either dollar amount or organic growth you expect to get out of that over the next kind of to months and then when you look i guess at the fee rate on wrap accounts thats also been coming down for the last couple of years so kind of help us reconcile all those three maybe thanks james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah we dont really see that what youre saying per se i know the wrap account in the previous year or two were a bit higher but remember that was part of an industry shift we were part of that moving with the dol and activities and accelerating some of that transfer but from an organic level as ive said billion is still pretty nicely organically growth and we see that continuing ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 we feel like our fee rates are pretty good as youve said as we continue to move up markets some of the fees will be lower naturally based upon pricing but no i dont see it could move slightly from what weve said but i dont see a slowdown per se our client activity is good but we do a lot more business than wrap and so importantly its not just a wrap business per se we try to do more comprehensive business but i feel that thats not necessarily i see a slowing i see things go period to period but i think over the longer term we feel pretty good about it and we think that that will continue and our wrap balances are up yearoveryear so im not sure were out of line in anything in the industry there may be some further shift for some people where they were behind on it and accelerating it but weve always had a good strong wrap business alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it great thanks very much operator we have no
