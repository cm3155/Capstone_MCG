an evolving market assets under management grew nicely in the fourth quarter up to billion driven by market appreciation and positive foreign exchange in terms of some color on flows our us retail mutual fund outflows were in line with the industry though they remained pressured we had a bit of a pickup in gross sales and redemptions have slowed from a year ago uk retail remained soft and were seeing some improvements in europe for global institutional our outflows were elevated as we expected due to the actions we set to realign resources including portfolio management changes our product capabilities are extensive and the team is concentrating on regaining sales momentum performance is critical to that and were delivering consistent competitive investment performance that reflects our research expertise our and year numbers are very strong and we saw a nice pickup in the one year fixed income numbers and i highlight that we continue to have and 5star morningstar rated funds in our

record of strong financial performance including generating one of the best roes in the industry and with that we consistently demonstrate our ability to return to shareholders in the fourth quarter ameriprise returned another million and for the full year we returned billion to shareholders over the last five years we returned a substantial amount to shareholders that resulted in a share count reduction of as i look at ameriprise we continue to be well positioned the strong performance we achieved is underscored by the industry accolades ameriprise consistently earns over the course of the year this is the type of recognition we received out of stars in client satisfaction from our clients our employee and advisor engagement ranks among the best across all industries we have one of the highest customer trust scores in financial services jd power has awarded us for outstanding customer service experience for our advisor phone support five years in a row ameriprise is the winner in the wealth management category from kiplingers in addition weve been recognized as a militaryfriendly employer nine years in a row and as a best place to work for disability inclusion finally ameriprise is among the best managed companies of on the wall street journal management top list for the firm overall as we enter a year in the business our foundation and business are strong im immensely proud of our people and we have a great opportunity to continue our success together in now ill turn things over to walter and then well take your questions walter s berman executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc thank you jim as jim said strong results this quarter continued to demonstrate the leverage of our diversified business model across market cycles underlying eps grew to after adjusting for items in the quarter that we called out in the release these included of expense related to a regulatory accrual from severance expense and elevated markto market impacts on sharebased compensation expense of resulting from ameriprises substantial share price appreciation you would not have been aware of these items and their associated magnitude assets under management and administration ended the quarter at trillion up benefiting from billion of client flows in and market appreciation across the firm we continued to manage expenses tightly relative to the revenue opportunity within each segment ga increased only normalized to the items i noted we continued to take a disciplined approach on discretionary expenses across the firm to manage margins given the uncertainty in the macro environment as evidenced by the million of severance recognized in the third and fourth quarters at the same time we continued to make investments to drive business growth particularly in wealth management as we move into we will continue the same discipline and well maintain a flat expense base for the year at a minimum ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 our consolidated margin was excluding the items i noted and we have a bestinclass return on equity of the balance sheet fundamentals remain strong our excess capital and liquidity positions remain strong and weve seen a significant billion reduction in the net unrealized loss position to only billion our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable free cash flow contributions across all business segments this allowed us to return billion of capital to shareholders in the year a continuation of our differentiated track record lastly i mentioned that ameriprise successfully expanded its presence in the financial institutions channel the closing on our partnership with comerica bank in november that added an initial billion of client flows given the timing of the conversion there was limited financial benefit in the quarter on slide youll see our strong results in were driven by business momentum across key measures assets grew with revenues up pretax adjusted operating earnings grew and the pretax adjusted operating margin was the diversified nature of our businesses strengthens our model and drives our consistent performance it is this balance that enables ameriprise to consistently drive shareholder value across market cycles the key growth driver of ameriprise is the wealth management business as you can see on slide wealth management client assets increased yearoveryear to billion driven by strong organic growth and client flows along with higher equity markets we had billion of net inflows over the past year with billion coming in the quarter from new clients joining the firm the deepening of existing relationships and adding experienced advisors revenue per advisor reached in the quarter up from the prior year from higher spread revenue enhanced productivity and business growth on slide you can see how the business performance drove strong financial results for wealth management in the quarter adjusted operating net revenues increased to billion from growth in client assets in both wrap and brokerage accounts and improved transactional activity this included about billion of initial flows related to comerica partnership in addition to the billion of underlying client flows while markets were favorable in the quarter we did not realize the full benefit of the market appreciation in the quarter given our beginningofmonth billing practice we are starting the year with the wind at our backs with the significant market appreciation to end the year total cash balance including thirdparty money market funds and brokered cds reached a new high this quarter at billion we are seeing stability in our underlying client cash positions with sweep cash up sequentially this stabilization has continued into january additionally we continue to see new money flowing into money market funds and brokered cds as well as into our certificates this creates significant redeployment opportunities as markets normalize for clients to put money back to work in wrap and other products on our platform over time the financial benefits from cash remain significant and will be a sustainable source of earnings going forward adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased with distribution expense up reflecting higher asset balances excluding the regulatory accrual ga declined in the quarter and was up only for the full year we will continue to invest in this growing business while maintaining this expense discipline in ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 in total the underlying margin expanded basis points to reflecting our revenue growth combined with expense discipline this level is consistent with our margin for the full year turning to asset management on slide financial results were very strong in the quarter and we are managing the business well through a challenging environment for active asset managers total aum increased to billion primarily from higher equity markets and foreign exchange translation partially offset by net outflows like other active managers we experienced pressure on retail flows from global market volatility and a riskoff investor sentiment in addition we had billion of institutional outflows that included billion of expected breakage from portfolio management changes made as part of our reengineering initiatives investment performance is another critical area of focus and longterm and 10year investment performance remains strong we also had notable improvements in oneyear fixed income performance in the quarter from strength in mortgage opportunities tax exempts and strategic municipal income strategies in the quarter operating earnings increased million as a result of equity market appreciation disciplined expense management and higher performance fees which more than offset the cumulative impact of net outflows performance fees are an important part of our business and reflect excellent performance in our hedge fund and other institutional accounts but the recognition of performance fees is uneven throughout the year while we had million in performance fees in both and the fourth quarter this year included million in performance fees and the fourth quarter of only included million we are finalizing the integration of bmo and are looking globally at areas where we can to enhance operational efficiency and manage expenses so we are wellpositioned going forward ga was down excluding the impact from foreign exchange translation and performance fee compensation and the margin was in our target range of in the quarter looking ahead as jim said we will continue to take further expense action in given the environment to preserve margin in our target range lets turn to slide retirement protection solutions continued to deliver good earnings and free cash flow generation reflecting the high quality of the business that has been built over a long period of time pretax adjusted operating earnings in the quarter increased to million reflecting higher investment yields overall retirement protection solutions sales improved in the quarter with protection sales up to million primarily in highermargin vul products variable annuity sales grew to billion with the majority of sales in structured variable annuities turning to slide ameriprise delivered excellent growth in and has done the same over the longer term and through changing market cycles reflecting our focus on profitable growth in revenues grew from higher interest earnings higher equity markets and solid client net inflows earnings per share increased from last year from revenue trends wellmanaged expenses and differentiated capital return and roe increased basis points to nearly ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 over the past five years we have generated revenue and eps compounded annual growth and basis points of improvement in roe this is differentiated performance across multiple cycles compared to our peers and speaks to the complementary nature of our business mix and the growth of our wealth management business turning to slide you can see wealth management was a significant contributor to ameriprises successful performance driving twothirds of the companys operating earnings our advisors are becoming more productive with the support of our advice model with revenue per advisor of in the year up on an annualized basis from and we are growing profitably with growth in pretax earnings since and over that timeframe our wealth management margin has expanded basis points to nearly putting it at industry leading levels now lets finish with the balance sheet on slide our solid balance sheet fundamentals and free cash flow generations have supported our ability to execute a consistent capital return strategy while continuing to invest for growth in we returned billion to shareholders with million in the fourth quarter but over the past five years we returned billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase this included the repurchase of million shares at an average price of resulting in a net reduction in our share count of looking ahead capital management will continue to be a point of differentiation for ameriprise with that we will take your questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions your first question comes from the line of brennan hawken from ubs please go ahead with your question brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions id like to start with the bank so weve got billion i believe youve indicated that theres expectation for billion of maturities expected in can you give a sense given where rates are in the market today what kind of yield pickup youre likely to see on those balances and whether or not you have visibility into what those maturities might be in walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc sure in we anticipate it will still be billion again these are payoffs and from that standpoint and when we look at it let me answer the question this way from a net interest income standpoint when we evaluate looking at various scenarios and using the forward curves the generation in and will be higher than that in because again the rates we have been adding at are very at rates close to and that runoff will be basically coming through and our reinvestments the differentials will still allow us to have a higher net interest income in and but its billion in both years ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc billion okay thank you very much and then one sort of mechanical question so quarteroverquarter off balance sheet brokerdealer yield compressed pretty substantially but its my understanding that thats tied to the billion of cash sweep tied to comerica so is that right and was that due to like some kind of promotional or temporary crediting rate and when is that expected to roll off and normalize walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so if were talking about now the off balance sheet rate on a sequential basis is that what youre referring to brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yes exactly thank you walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so that yes we did take on a billion down for comerica and that will transition through over the next six months and certainly that will work towards the rate increasing but our base rate has basically stayed the same excomerica theres been no change brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ryan krueger from kbw please go ahead with your question ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning first i just wanted to followup on the comment on net interest income in terms of and expecting to be higher than what did you can you give us any sense of what you assumed in terms of the forward rates when you made that comment was that using the forward curve or any more color there walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc we are using the forward curve in that and we run sensitivity but what my statement was referring to was the forward curve as the latest forward curve ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then just in terms of the size of the bank can you give any color on kind of expectations for potentially moving some of the cash sweep balance into the bank and how what you think the bank asset size could grow to over the course of ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc sure so right now we are seeing stability and really little growth in our sweep accounts so we feel very comfortable about it and we still have buffer there so we are evaluating that but well be more measured as we go forward because weve certainly placed and shifted a lot of substantial amount but you would see that it will be increasing but at a slower pace as we evaluate these sweep balances that support that so i would say that it will be increasing but at a slower pace ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of alex blostein from goldman sachs please go ahead with your question alex please go ahead with your question alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi good morning can you guys hear me james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi how are you thanks so i wanted to ask you guys a question around a substantial amount of cash that you guys have on the sidelines i think it was north of billion and i know you sort of talked about some of that coming into some of the investment products but as you sort of think about what are the likely areas where this capital could go into with respect to wrap accounts or something else how would you frame that and maybe talk through some of the revenue lift that you could get from that walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc are you talking about where our cash sits today on alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc so not stuff thats in the sweep right but theres been other capital that i think essentially earning you guys not a whole lot whether its the cds or money market funds kind of where those balances are and where that could shift james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so those balances are in money markets and brokerage cds shortterm that will roll off and so as they do i think advisors will evaluate whether they put that back into the market and if they did i would probably say a ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 portion of that would go back a reasonable portion will go back most likely into wrap type programs in balanced type portfolios which would include both equities and fixed income et cetera alternatives on the other side of it there weve seen a bit of a pickup in some transactional activity as well in the fourth quarter so some of that will go back into transactional type activities as they look at longer duration type products as well so again thats really as advisors look at the market and they put money to work over time for their clients alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i got you thanks and then my second question was just around operating leverage for the firm and obviously encouraging to hear your comments around ga outlook if you roll that through it seems like the margin in the asset management business could be materially higher than sort of your longerterm ranges obviously not a terrible thing but as you sort of think about those historical targets are they still something you try to manage the business to or its really just kind of more of the output because the fees are obviously off to a very good start in and expenses are going to be very tightly managed walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes so obviously weve been very proactive in managing the controllable aspect of that on the expenses not just in awm even in am but across the board so yes obviously it will be dependent on several factors as it relates to markets or other things as it relates to margin but with right im not going to forecast exactly where it goes but i think we feel comfortable that we have put in place our control of ga at asset management and that we have the capability with the right set of conditions sets going on with markets and certainly if we as we get make progress on our flows that is certainly can increase but right now were comfortable with the current levels that we have but we have the potential alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay great thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak from wolfe research please go ahead with your question steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning so wanted to start off with just a question on the awm margin just given some of your larger wirehouse peers have guided to lower wealth margins for the next few quarters given the absence of nii tailwinds incremental investments to sustain organic growth you noted walter that your spread revenues will be more resilient in but do you believe you can sustain that north of pretax margin in awm even in the face of rate cuts in line with the forward curve walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 yes i think that we have reasonable confidence that we will be able to sustain but obviously there are variables that go into that but as i indicated our net interest income was will certainly be higher than so yes i think we have a reasonable level of confidence in that steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great and just for my followup on capital return the payout came in below the target apologies if i missed this but just wanted to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about the payout trajectory over the next few quarters especially in light of the robust excess capital generation that weve been seeing walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so yes we came in at i would agree with you for the year and right now we our capacity and capability certainly remains very strong as you can see from the balance sheet elements and certainly our generation so i would think that a continuation of that strategy is probably a reasonable expectation steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great thanks so much for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of suneet kamath from jefferies please go ahead with your question suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc great thanks just wanted to start with the asset management business and the expense reductions that youre doing there clearly youre trying to defend your margin which i understand but it feels like were starting to see potentially some commercial impacts there i think you alluded to some outflows related to head count reduction so i guess my question is how are you thinking about sort of trying to balance that right where youre cutting expenses but at the same time potentially seeing some negative commercial impacts walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well from that what you saw from basically the breakage that we took it wasnt basically a proactive evaluation of the payback that we were getting so that was a conscious decision on our part our expense plan has been basically evaluated on the basis of looking at march but looking at process and how we can improve efficiency so we feel very good about there is some basically spillover effects as you get to managing that ultimate return and some we will get breakage we believe the breakage certainly what we saw this year therell be some but manageable taking place in but manageable but again its a conscious decision on our part and we feel we give them opportunities to certainly redeploy the money in other products that we have so its again its we are controlling what we can and we which is on the ga expense and its through a conscious review of expense management ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then just to level set on that billion cash number that you talked about i mean if i think about that relative to total client assets it seems like its upwards around which is almost i think what you guys normally would expect is that the right way to think about it and then over time as rates kind of normalize that kind of to cash balance would probably trickle back down to somewhere in that to range and thats really the opportunity set thats in front of you in that business james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah suneet so it is sort of like double the amount that clients are holding usually compared to where they used to be and again advisors look at it with their clients and theyre getting a 5plus yield on it just to sit tight with unclear about the market moves et cetera so i do believe that over time that money will be redeployed but holding at higher rates right now its not an uncomfortable thing for clients and our advisors to keep extra cash there suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc and is there any reason why that money wouldnt come to ameriprise i mean it sounds like its in products outside of your firm but obviously your advisors do holistic financial planning so is there any reason why either from a diversification perspective or anything why that money might want to stay outside of ameriprise james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc no in fact the money is at ameriprise the advisors have just put it into whether money market or brokered cds where there was a bigger lineup of brokered cds before we had our bank and cds that well be launching so i think its a very but they just as they did that they put it into our own certificate program as well and that grew nicely its up to billion in total so i think it was just the outlets for where to park the cash i think as we put more bank products in as we develop the bank some of that will go into our bank products we think also theres an opportunity for us to capture more cash from our clients holding it at their banking institutions so but the money thats currently that billion is at ameriprise and as that rolls over or opportunity the advisors see to rebalance accounts theyll put that money to work suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thanks jim operator your next question comes from the line of tom gallagher from evercore isi please go ahead with your question thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 good morning first question just on the layoffs in asset management i think it was pms can you comment on the size of the aum that they were managing and what exactly happened there did you merge or close any funds did you replace them just a little more color there thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well with the breakage it was basically on that one we closed upon and obviously weve looked for alternatives and was institutional and then the other funds we feel there are opportunities where we can basically merge them into other products that we have and to get the efficiencies and effect on that so its it was a capital review of it and we just felt based on payback it would make sense to do that thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi and walter the total aum related to the layoffs are you able to provide that walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc right now where we the of the billion was basically the that was the amount in that fund pretty much thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi right but of the i think it was pms that were let go are you able to size that in the entirety walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i would have to get back to you exactly on the but i think the majority of it is still related back to the breakage that we see we saw but let me get back to you on that thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay all right thanks the redeployment out of corporate into the segments i think its around million can you explain what happened there and was it all nii or what happened on that reallocation of the segments walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so what we have obviously are intercompany cash transferring that goes between the segments and we evaluated awm that the crediting rate that we were giving that was not really i would say indiscernible and marketdriven and so we adjusted it based upon the condition sets that we saw today and that will be something that will remain in awms profitability going forward based as long as the levels stay where they are the second one was really an element of relating to we looked at our models as it relates to rps and it was candidly it was not the right rate we were just not crediting them with the right amount as simple as that and yes its in all net interest income and it has no effect on the company that shifts the money ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi right just a reallocation among segments that makes sense walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc thats right thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi and then just final followup this sustainable free cash flow conversion you returned in do you plan on stepping that back up to in or should we expect it to remain closer to do you have an idea of where you would expect walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so as we said business opportunistic we have the capacity we certainly as you see we generate a lot of free cash flow and we evaluate that as looking at the opportunities we are continuing to invest in our business so thats not a constraining factor so i would say right now its a reasonable estimate to just assume the level that we just had and then we will adjust to be opportunistic about it thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of kenneth lee from rbc capital markets please go ahead with your question kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning thanks for taking the question just one on the expense management initiatives are there wonder if you could just further flesh it out looking for any other areas outside of asset management and perhaps wondering if you could just give a little bit in terms of timeframes are these actions all to be completed within this year thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes so what you saw with the million severance and certainly our plans that these are all actionable and certainly from our standpoint have already been put into play and so we are you should see the benefit of that materializing as we relayed were basically looking at our expenses for will be flat at a minimum and obviously we continue to make substantial investments in the various businesses especially in awm so its we have pretty high confidence on this kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 got you very helpful and then just one followup any updated thinking in terms of potential reinsurance transaction on the rps side just especially given recent industry developments and the rate environment thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes listen we have certainly observed the recent transactions and we feel that it creates an opportunity and from that standpoint as we always said were always looking for the bid ask and i think those bid asks are certainly coming in alignment and provides an opportunity kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc got you very helpful thanks again operator your next question comes from the line of mark mclaughlin from bank of america please go ahead with your question mark mclaughlin q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning thanks for taking my question i believe in your opening remarks you had mentioned you were seeing a stabilization of cash levels through january i was just curious if you had any more color yeartodate on that i would have expected more redeployments just from seasonality rebalancing and distributions and the like walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc in the sweep accounts and this is as of two days ago we have seen a complete stabilization from that standpoint a little increase so were obviously observing we understand the seasonality of it but certainly its what i indicated and thats through two days ago mark mclaughlin q analyst bofa securities inc awesome and then my other question had to do with retirement and protection you guys had a pretty sizable pickup in the yield for your net investment income i was curious if you could give us an update on any color on the investment profile of that book just trying to get a better idea of sensitivity to rates there walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc no thats invested out now we took advantage of the rate situation as we saw so that is pretty much completed at this view and also as i indicated it will get to pick up going forward of certainly the intercompany cash mark mclaughlin q analyst bofa securities inc awesome thank you so much ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 operator your next question comes from the line of john barnidge from piper sandler please go ahead with your question john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co good morning thank you for the opportunity in this pm reduction in asset management it clearly followed a thorough review in that review were there areas of growth identified are you looking to get larger in any specific products that maybe have come to surface out of that pm review james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes so what we did is we had some teams that we felt theyre managing small levels of assets and it wasnt economical for us in those areas but we have good teams that could have assumed those assets and had good performance so we made adjustments there but in so doing yes we have reviewed our overall front office and all of the products and the portfolios and the capabilities that we have on the investment side we feel theres a good opportunity we always have that in the equity part of the arena but we feel really that we do have a good fixed income and credit shop and that we think theres opportunity for us to actually get a greater fair share there as we continue to look at what the environment is and so but weve evaluated that both domestically and internationally and were picking our pockets of where we really want to double down john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you for that and then my followup question is around the risk transfers and the comment about the bid and ask youve seen the market change a little bit to include thirdparty sidecars would that be an area of interest walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well weve looked at it and candidly for us probably not because of the most people enter into that for growth purposes and we have a fairly large share so probably not its not but we continue to look john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you operator your next question comes from the line of michael cyprys from morgan stanley please go ahead with your question q hey good morning thanks for taking the question this is indiscernible stepping in for mike cyprys of morgan stanley just wanted to ask a bigger picture question about the opportunity set for broadening out to affiliation options weve clearly seen a lot of growth coming through the ria channel in particular im just curious how you guys are thinking about the opportunity to capture some of that growth ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah the team is focused on the ria channel as well in developing our distribution platform capabilities there

about what tech initiatives you have in place at the moment for advisors in terms of what youre doing to help the ameriprise platform stand out and differentiate itself in the marketplace and particularly what you have coming over the next say to months in terms of the tech pipeline james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah we feel unbelievably good about our total platform for the advisors from our combination of crm platform which is the latest and the greatest of all the capabilities with all the integrated technology and data that they can use on their client portfolios and engagement to our emeeting capabilities that actually help them actually put together their actual proposals for clients and the engagement of meeting with them regarding their needs two even our ai capabilities helping them identify opportunities in their book so we feel really good about the suite of capabilities that we have but those capabilities are all integrated which makes the advisor much easier with their dashboards to engage their clients to manage their books and to have that deeper engagement with them through the advice planning models so we feel really good and were continuing to invest heavily and thats complemented by all the mobile and the web capabilities that we have for them to do business so we feel that we have a stateoftheart
