ability to create a sustainable and attractive revenue stream in this interest rate environment in our asset management business we continue to experience headwinds in this environment and remain focused on adjusting appropriately in terms of the market environment the sp and international equity markets have rallied more recently through the end of july however they were only up yearoveryear on average for the quarter fixed income markets remain unfavorable particularly in europe while inflation has come down its still above the feds targeted rate as we saw yesterday the fed increased basis points and said it will continue to assess additional information in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return to a inflation rate with that as a backdrop ameriprise continues to benefit from our diversified business mix as well as higher interest rates in our bank and certificate companies assets under management and administration increased nicely up to trillion reflecting our organic growth and positive markets total adjusted operating net revenue was up to billion the combination of strong revenue growth particularly from our spread business as well as wellmanaged expenses drove earnings to million up with eps up to and our return on equity was outstanding and reached a new record of a level that few financial firms have achieved now lets turn to business highlights in wealth management we delivered another excellent quarter as we serve clients well with goalbased advice and deliver a highly satisfying experience we continue to drive very good asset growth with total client assets up to billion and total client flows of billion up yearoveryear our client acquisition growth was also strong especially in the to million client range this is an area where we consistently had good momentum and its a key growth opportunity for us were leveraging our ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 strategic investments to help advisers engage clients and prospects provide a great client experience and run highly successful and efficient practices our fully integrated technology suite streamlines many of our advisers administrative tasks and frees up their time to go deeper with clients and to navigate the complexities within their financial situations for example we introduced an important capability that enables advisers to generate highly personalized presentations centered on client goal achievement since the launch it has helped to build on our already strong client satisfaction net flows and practice growth for our advisers who are incorporating it into their practices and its reduced meeting prep time as much as and allows more time for client acquisition were also beginning to use ai and analytics to further enhance how we engage and work with clients with ai we can serve up realtime information to help advisers identify a possible next best opportunity for clients based on their needs backed by our exceptional support adviser satisfaction retention and growth are all excellent ameriprise advisers consistently have some of the highest productivity growth in the business in the second quarter it increased nicely again up to per adviser were also incorporating the use of data and analytics in how we identify productive advisers who are a good fit to recruit to the firm and more likely to make the switch it was another strong quarter for recruitment with the addition of experienced advisers were consistently bringing in large highly productive adviser practices from across the industry in the spring i spent time with our top of advisers both tenured at ameriprise and more recently experienced advisers who have joined us they repeatedly shared that our advanced capabilities and technology combined with our excellent leadership coaching and marketing support gives them a tremendous advantage in how they serve clients and run successful practices they are very proud to affiliate with ameriprise and energized about the direction of the company and the opportunities in front of us during the quarter clients remained cautious seeking yield as they continue to maintain higher balances in cash oriented products cash continued to increase as clients continue to hold cash and we ended the quarter with about billion in cash and cash equivalents wrap assets under management increased to over billion reflecting positive flows and market appreciation that occurred at the end of the quarter the more recent increase in markets will be a benefit as we go through the quarter for the first time since the beginning of the year we saw signs in june that clients are starting to move some funds back into the market which brings me to the bank ameriprise bank continues to perform well with assets growing to nearly billion its a strong complement to our business and an attractive way to gain spread revenue in this rate environment bank and certificate balances grew ph to billion the cash balances in these accounts are very rational today and we feel comfortable with our position we will continue to build out our banking capabilities and are in the process of introducing other savings products later this year this will help advisers further deepen client relationships and bring in more assets from other banking institutions ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 with our latest research in addition to our core client segments we found that the ameriprise value proposition and brand are very appealing to high net worth investors as well as millennials who are hungry for advice and seeking guidance from advisers who truly understand them and their priorities these are market segments were looking to serve more in the future and this was also reinforced by the complement of external accolades and recognition we continue to earn the way we work with clients defines ameriprise and i believe our reputation is a competitive advantage during the quarter ameriprise was named by kiplingers readers sic kiplinger readers as the overall winner in the wealth management category we earned the highest ratings for each of the four criteria the trustworthiness of our advisers the quality of financial advice provided the likeliness to recommend the firm to others and we earned the highest rating in overall satisfaction ameriprise also ranked on newsweeks magazine most trustworthy companies in america list for the second consecutive year and we earned top performer recognition in understands me and shares my values from hearts wallets and speaking of values ameriprise culture is another very important positive advisers who have joined us with decades in the business tell us that our company is unique and not like any other theyve been part of theyre impressed by things like our supportive growth culture and their accessibility to senior leadership finally in terms of profitability for wealth management it was another strong quarter across the board and that includes margin which reached a new record of moving to retirement protection we have highquality well risk managed books and were generating strong consistent earnings of driven by the repositioning of our investment portfolio last year given the rate climate our free cash flow and return on capital remain excellent the team is concentrated on accumulation products that align with our clients needs and the business in our life business were focused on our variable universal life and disability products that are appropriate for this environment protection sales were up nicely increasing with the majority of sales in highermargin accumulation vul products and in variable annuities our structured product continues to attract strong interest combining with our variable annuities without living benefits sales are down from a year ago in part due to the decision to exit guarantees here again were using intelligent document processing and robotics to make processes more efficient things like automating our processes and underwriting decisions were seeing the benefit and the pickup in sales as we discussed we feel good about our product portfolio both for clients and the business which consistently delivers good returns moving to asset management as you know we manage the business prudently like other active managers were facing reduced flows in this environment the business continues to operate well and generates good fees and were adjusting for headwinds accordingly ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 in terms of investment performance we continue to have excellent longerterm performance in equities fixed income and asset allocation strategies with over of our funds above the median for the fiveyear and over for the 10year period our oneyear performance has improved across the board this includes some of our larger franchises including in uk equities where were benefiting from our quality positioning and in fixed income given our strength in credit in terms of flows ill start with global retail where we continue to experience a level of outflows in north america we remain in net outflows but we had nice improvement in fixed income in fact we are better than the industry in taxable bond meanwhile we continue to see outflow pressures in equities largely from lower gross sales as redemptions have improved we continue to focus our adviser segmentation strategy to drive good engagement in north america in emea retail flows in both the uk and continental europe remain under pressure however in institutional we were in net inflows excluding legacy insurance partner flows as we garnered nice wins in highyield and investment grade credit that more than offset large redemptions in ldi strategies given the market dislocation now id like to give you a brief update on our emea acquisition and executing the integration in europe i wanted you to know that it does take time due to the complexity of the legal entity structures as well as regulatory and employment considerations we made it through a number of important steps and we have now moved to the next level of consolidation including the colocation of our teams through our existing real estate and the near completion of some of the major technology migration work given the environment were taking a very focused look across the business globally to further reduce expenses this includes identifying and stopping less growthdriven activities and also redeploying resources where we see opportunities to support our margin in summary were controlling what we can control and making the necessary changes to adjust in this environment reflecting on the firm overall ameriprise delivered a strong first half of the year and were well positioned to continue to navigate and grow our complement of businesses provides nice contributions and synergies we consistently generate good appropriate earnings in total and good cash flow to invest and return to shareholders at attractive levels we returned million of earnings to shareholders in the quarter which represented nearly of our earnings in addition as you saw our board approved a new billion share repurchase authorization that reflects the strength of the business across the firm we continue to make good investments in our businesses and as always we are sharply focused on execution and while we manage expenses very well we will be looking for additional expense opportunities as we move into to adjust to the environment from a people perspective our team is highly engaged in fact in the quarter forbes magazine named ameriprise one of americas best large employers the list ranks the us companies most highly recommended as a top place to work with that ill turn things over to walter to provide his perspective in more detail on the quarter and then well take your questions ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 walter s berman executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc thank you as jim said results this quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of the ameriprise value proposition as adjusted eps increased to results reflect wealth management core and cash business momentum as well as continued expense discipline in total our wealth management business grew to of the companys earnings up from a year ago as a result of a growth in wealth management earnings asset management faced headwinds similar to the industry in terms of flows and fixed income market declines and retirement protection solutions delivered good earnings growth primarily from our decision to reposition the investment portfolio late last year across the firm we continue to manage our expenses tightly relative to the revenue opportunity within each segment while we continue to make investments in the bank and other growth initiatives particularly in wealth management we are taking a disciplined approach on discretionary expenses across our businesses excluding marktomarket impacts on sharebased compensation expense ga was up only however ga in the first half of was unusually low as a result of the pandemic our ga expenses remain on track with our expectations balance sheet fundamentals remain strong our portfolio is well positioned our hedging remains highly effective and we have strong capital and liquidity positions this allowed us to return million of capital to shareholders as a strong return of of our operating earnings lets turn to slide assets under management and administration ended the quarter at trillion up auma benefited from strong client flows and equity market appreciation partially offset by lower fixed income markets revenue growth was strong at from higher interest earnings and cumulative benefit of client net inflows with average equity markets up only the impact of equity market appreciation in june will be reflected in our third quarter awm results given the billing of our wrap business is based on beginning of the month balances pretax earnings increased from last year with meaningful benefits from strong client flows higher interest rates and wellmanaged expenses lets turn to individual segment performance beginning with wealth management on slide the wealth management client assets increased to billion driven by strong organic growth and client flows along with higher equity markets as you are aware there has been significant volatility since  of which we have navigated well our client and wrap assets have remained consistent with our industry peers over this period our client flows continue to be strong at billion up from last year client money has gone into a combination of wrap and nonadvisory accounts as clients continue to be in a defensive posture our flexible model and broad offerings allow advisers and clients to pivot as market and client preferences shift while the money stays within the system gives us potential upside going forward revenue per adviser reached in the quarter up from the prior year from higher spread revenue enhanced productivity and business growth ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 turning to slide id like to provide an update on client cash levels our client cash balances comprised of cash sweep and certificates have returned to more historic levels at billion which translate to about of total client assets the financial benefit from cash remains unchanged despite a lower volume of cash as we have seen a significant lift in the interest rate earned at the bank and certificate business our fee yields have increased nearly basis points from a year ago and picked up basis points sequentially resulting in very strong interest earnings growth i would like to note that we continue to see new money flows into money markets and brokered cds albeit at a lower level in june which brought our total cash level to billion this creates a significant redeployment opportunity as markets normalize for clients to put money back to work in wrap and other products on our platform while there is some seasonality with cash levels particularly with tax payments in march and april cash remains an important component of the clients asset allocation like others in the industry balances are stabilizing our sweep cash has an average size of per account and of the aggregate cash is now in accounts under and we have seen a very limited movement out of these accounts in the quarter we moved approximately billion from off balance sheet cash on to the banks balance sheet we continue to evaluate the opportunity to bring additional balances onto the bank balance sheet as we move forward lastly we continue to manage our investment portfolios prudently our bank portfolio is aaa rated with the year duration the overall yield on the portfolio is and rising with the new money yield on investments in the second quarter of our certificate company portfolio is highly liquid with over half of the portfolio in cash governments and agencies it is aa rated on average with a oneyear duration as i noted last quarter the portfolio yield lag declined crediting rates as new money moved into this business this quarter the portfolio yield increased basis points in total the certificate company portfolio is now yielding with new purchases in the quarter at that level as well on slide we delivered extremely strong results in wealth management on all fronts profitability increased in the quarter with strong organic growth and the benefit of the higher interest rates pretax operating margin reached a new high of up basis points yearoveryear and up basis points sequentially as i mentioned before the benefit from the june market appreciation of over will be a tailwind for quarter three results given we bill our wrap business based on the beginning of the month balances adjusted operating expenses increased with distribution expenses up reflecting higher asset balances consistent with our expectations ga is up in the quarter this is off of a very low base last year given the impact of the pandemic and we continue to make investments for growth we expect awm full year ga growth to be in the midsingle digits lets turn to asset management on slide we are managing the business well through a challenging environment that is impacting the industry total aum increased to billion primarily from higher equity markets partially offset by lower fixed income markets asset management like other active managers was in outflows in the quarter ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 reinvested dividends were billion lower in the current quarter however underlying net new sales were fairly consistent to last year like others we experienced pressure from global market volatility and a riskoff investor sentiment investment performance has been another critical area of focus and we are seeing improvement including in fixed income strategies overall and 10year performance remains very strong and as jim said we had improvement in the oneyear numbers on slide you can see asset management financial results reflecting the market environment as anticipated earnings declined to million as a result of deleveraging net outflows and lower performance fees in the quarter the margin was down sequentially to importantly we continue to manage the areas we can control expenses remain well managed total expenses declined with ga up only as jim said given the environment we are taking a very focused look across the business globally to further reduce expenses this includes identifying and stopping less growthfocused activities and redeploying resources where we can see an opportunity to support our margin lets turn to slide retirement protection solutions continued to deliver good earnings and free cash flow generation reflecting the high quality of the business in the quarter pretax adjusted operating earnings was million up from the prior year primarily as a result of higher investment yields from the portfolio repositioning we executed last year however earnings in the current year were unfavorably impacted by million from a model update resulting from a system conversion and timing of earnings recognition for payout annuities which is expected to normalize we continue to view normalized annual earnings of million as a reasonable expectation for this business overall sales declined related to our decision to discontinue sales of variable annuities with living benefit riders a year ago however protection sales improved and remain concentrated in highmargin asset accumulation vul which now represents over onethird of the total insurance in force now lets move to the balance sheet on slide our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong and our diversified highquality investment portfolio remains well positioned in total the average credit rating of the portfolio is aa with only of the portfolio in below investmentgrade securities va hedge effectiveness remain very strong at our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable free cash flow contributions from all of the business segments this supports the consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders during the quarter we returned million to shareholders and still ended the quarter with billion of excess capital and billion of holding company available liquidity we remain committed to continuing to return capital to shareholders and announced a new billion share repurchase authorization through september with that well take your questions ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionanswer session operator instructions the first question is from alex blostein with goldman sachs your line is open alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everybody thanks for the question maybe we could start with a question on awm i want to zone in on kind of the interplay between net new asset growth jim that you talked about in cash so to your point lots of capital obviously sitting in the sidelines and money market fund treasuries and as fed funds peaks its likely that some of that cash is going to make its way into investment products so what are your expectations for awm net new asset growth into the second half particularly within advisory and then at the same time do you think any of that reallocation of cash could put incremental pressure on the billion of brokerage sweep balances which i think were down about sequentially or are they pretty kind of troughy sort of at operational levels at this point so as part of that maybe just an update on kind of where that billion sits in july as well james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc okay so alex i think weve continued to have very good client flows quartertoquarter this quarter they were up from last year but remember in the second quarter you always have some adjustment because of tax payments so if you look at even where we had some of the cash sorting in the second quarter a significant amount was due to those tax payments coming out in april and that also then hits your client net flows on a consistent basis like the cash having said that i would say we continue to see that client flow activity being good our client engagement is good but to the point you just referenced that we mentioned consistent level has gone more into cash as a holding because of the current yield right now this market has maintained itself a bit better than people expected i think there was a surprise now how the market has climbed so much now its starting to broaden a bit rather than just based on a few stocks and so if that does continue and theres a settlement in a sense of even fixed income yields feeling like theyre not going to continue to rise at this point there might be a shift back as was beginning to see into fixed income products other than cash for a longer duration as well as in equities and so now where does that money come from our belief is that weve never held this amount of cash balances before right and so billion is up to like of our total assets here and some of that will come back from those positional cash areas regarding the sweep per se we all hold a certain level of cash in those accounts because of usage just like a checking account and certain things like that so were not thinking that a large amount or the significant amount will come back in fact wed see the cash sorting slowing as we go into the down through the beginning of the third quarter here and so my belief is that itll come more from positional cash and because of the size of the balances were maintaining now i cant i dont have a perfect crystal ball but when money comes back in then more is actually held in a sweep for transactional activity that occurs so thats really how were thinking ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i got you thats helpful any update on where that billion is in july just tactically walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well in july yes we saw it has slowed the way we anticipated and were just observing now but we feel comfortable with the slowing that were seeing alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay great and then my second question just around the asset management dynamics that you described obviously it sounds like youre adjusting the expense base to the sort of headwinds were seeing across the industry i mean maybe put a little more granularity about kind of what that means what are your expectations for ga growth within the asset management business for the second half and it sounds like thatll continue into and i guess bigger picture flows a challenge thats been the story for some time but the markets to your point earlier ph are up right so the revenue base could actually grow despite the flow challenges how does that inform this quarter kind of ga reallocation dynamics could ga be sort of flat to down even in that scenario or the upward market will just naturally put some pressure on the cost base james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so what were really focused on is and i think if you looked at the second quarter ga was actually down but because of the share price appreciation and the plans et cetera it ended up up but the underlying was actually down and we expect that to continue and were taking a much more concerted effort now that weve gone through some of the major integration activities that we had to do in europe even though thats not complete now we can take a more holistic view of our global expense base which we are across all areas and we think there is some good opportunity for us to really target for a reduction in expenses as we move forward and through and thats really our focus alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great super helpful thanks guys operator the next question is from brennan hawken with ubs your line is open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions id like to start on the pending comerica deal so could we get an update there are the assets still around billion or has that changed due to market tailwinds or otherwise and is this base of assets similar to other bank deals that weve seen where theres more of a bias to brokerage than advisory and or cash allocations kind of similar to what you have in awm ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so its walter as it relates to comerica its still on track and the activity levels and certainly the assets that we announced at the when we made consummate the arrangement is on track also and its characterization yes cash is a component but it is within the ranges of the transaction so we feel very comfortable with it and were targeting for the fourth quarter brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay so hasnt really changed from indiscernible got it perfect okay thank you and then have you as we start to see the sort of fluid environment and the forward look for rates and with a potential for lower rates as we move into maybe i was hoping for an update on the maturity profile of the cds within the certificate company and how are you thinking about managing those balances and maybe either pulling back on rate or leaning in depending on the outlook and the idea that some of those rates and that funding would be locked in a potentially declining rate environment walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so you mentioned the certificate i would probably focus more on the bank because the bank is really where we have now the advantage of investing and having duration as youve seen our yield right now is we certainly see that increasing as we have maturities and other things so we feel quite comfortable that as the environment i dont know its going to go up dont know its going to go down or stay the same but we are well positioned to have that stability of earnings there and that the yield that we see at the bank which is the majority of where weve gone out for investing will prevail as we look over the near term so were in a very good position from that standpoint brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah no i totally appreciate that and i hear you i was more thinking about managing on the cost side of it james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc on certificate side as we would say we sort of match us sort of like based on the yield we provide for those things so we sort of look to sort of keep a certain spread on that based on when the money coming in or where we look at it when its matured walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah and the spread as i indicated increased because obviously well our investments are catching up with the rate and its short duration its oneyear so from that standpoint we will adjust it both from the rate crediting rate and certainly our investments but we feel very comfortable with the spreads there as its incorporated brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 right and the spread is durable in both declining environments as well as rising environment walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well adjust but yes well maintain a certain degree of spread but obviously adjust as rates go up and down right brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc right thank you for taking my questions operator the next question is from erik bass with autonomous research your line is open erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp hi thank you for asset management do you still think that to margin is the right target to think about nearterm and given the expense actions youve talked about as well as the benefit from rising markets do you think you could get back to that level in the second half of this year james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i cant listen i cant predict the third quarter per se but were not changing that targeted rate and we definitely believe that we can be within that targeted rate i cant tell you about a quarter but i would probably say yeah we feel comfortable with that as we go to the second half but into erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp perfect and then can you update us on the plans to launch a brokered cd product and any other bank products for the second half of the year and what your expectations are for the type of assets that those could attract james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes so we did soft launch a brokered cd in the second quarter and thats starting to take hold here we also put out a base savings product again thats beginning to take hold and we have plans for the third the end of the third quarter to actually put some incentives type activity there to bring in new cash from outside the firm and also a preferred type of savings product in the fourth quarter so were sort of getting how they are positioned on the platform and then how we sort of roll that out from soft launches et cetera but yes we will have a set of those type of savings products as we go through the rest of the year into next year we will then target to bring in more cash externally erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp thank you and how would you sort of tier the margin expectation on that relative to the other cash products or certificates ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so what i would say first of all you got to separate the sweep which is a different animal from various savings products but ill let walter answer that walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah the margin as we have certainly a reserve count at certs and the margin in the bank is similar its a little harder but the margin is good and then were competitive on each one of the products as we look at the cd and obviously the rates there are certainly being driven by regional banks and others but we will remain competitive but the margins there are lower as you would expect erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp got it thank walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc indiscernible erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp yeah thank you operator the next question is from suneet kamath with jefferies your line is open suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning just going back to the bank for a second so our understanding is that youll have i think billion of assets sort of maturing and rolling into new assets in the second half and then a similar amount in the first half of next year so would it be possible to get sort of the current yields on those assets just so we can kind of think through when that reinvestment occurs how much upside you guys would have walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so i would say youre right it will probably ph you saw where it is today in range with that were getting in the ranges high low and so that should go up i cant tell you where rates are going to be but if rates stay where they are actually move around basis points basis points by the end of the year suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc so youre saying an incremental to basis points ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah itll get to around yeah suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc got it okay and then i guess walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc and again i just want to clarify thats if rates stay the way they are today okay and spread suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc yeah got it okay and then i guess youre talking about this now billion cash number and i think last quarter that was maybe billion obviously theres a portion of that that you guys have kind of in that billion range so as we think about that incremental billion i know some of thats in other companies products but whats a reasonable expectation in terms of how much of those assets you guys think you could ultimately have in your own products james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so i think what i would say is i think a good amount could come back but not just into our own savings type products but more importantly into the wrap type of business again if you recollect before the sort of period where people got a little more concerned we had roughly a majority of our client flows going into wrap and so i believe right now we are at sort of a low point of the amount of cash being deployed into wrap and i do believe part of that went to positional cash and that positional cash will start to come in and remember i think the investments in fixed income is much lower than its been in a long time because of the yields going up on duration and people not wanting to get whipsawed and so that money will come back in and that does go into wrap accounts as well because its more of a balanced portfolio that they utilize suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc got it and then if i could just sneak one more in jim i thought your comment about high net worth and millennial opportunities sounded like it was new is that an opportunity something that you can attack sort of organically or are there capabilities that youd need to acquire in order to capitalize on that growth opportunity thanks james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc no suneet were already for instance were already bringing in high net worth clients nicely but we have not made that a more concerted effort in the franchise yet but now we are putting more deploying around that and we do have most of the capabilities if not all of them i mean theres always some bells and whistles we add but we have added to our product platform our alternative platform et cetera ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 we have now and the advice part of what we have actually worked very well for high net worth clients and what we found is when we did our research that we are considered up there for high net worth clients or prospects similar to any of the private houses out there that cater to them or the major wire houses that cater to them so we dont have a disadvantage there and its one that were building out the focus of our advisers to really understand and see that so that they can target it more and then on the millennial side weve made a lot of investments in our digital capabilities and the engagement way of doing that we will also be really starting to focus more on for bringing in younger clients either through some of the younger advisers we bring but more even direct in some of our things because we have remote channel set up to work with clients that way and so i feel very good about those opportunities giving us further expansion efforts suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thank you operator the next question is from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is open michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning its michael anagnostakis on for steven i just wanted to circle back to the rate sensitivity picture here i guess given the shape of the curve maybe you could provide some updated color on your rate sensitivity can you help us size the impact to your earnings from rate cuts on the static balance sheet and how do you expect your deposit betas to differ on the way down versus the way up given your certificate percentage and lowcost sweep deposits funding the bank thank you walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so again from the standpoint on rate going down we do have since we are now having some substantial amounts in the bank that would give us insulation from that standpoint for the portions that would be subject to shortterm of fed fund reductions on that basis you can imagine its a straight calculation for every percentage going down so its factored into our analysis and weve seen the cycle going up and going down but the mathematics are on that basis we have billion billion sitting in on off balance sheet you can do the calculation on a change as it relates to the certs the certs really do adjust its a matter like on the way up we lose them until it catches up and the way down well gain because well have the investments there and we certainly have the liquidity to cover it so therefore its a positive to us on the certs side when its going down because of the investments and just like weve had the catch up situation now when its been going up michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc got it and then i just want to flip on to expenses here i guess how should we be thinking about longterm ga growth for the firm given some of the reduction efforts youre undertaking a more fully funded bank and a progress on bmo if you could help us think about the growth between the wealth segment and the firm as a whole that would be great thank you ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc let me start and walter can complement so overall for the firm when we talk about ga per se i would say its going to be relatively flat and remember you got indiscernible are part of that but itll be relatively flat overall based on what were looking to do if you think about where there may be a little more versus a little less sort of maybe a little more in the awm because of the growth of that business and maybe and a bit less on the asset management side meaning that therell be expense reductions but overall if i look at that across the firm including all the various groups it will be relatively flat absorbing the inflationary expenses that occur while we continue to make good investments in the business operator the next question is from tom gallagher with evercore isi your line is open thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi good morning first question is why did ameriprise withdraw its application early this month to convert to a state chartered industrial bank and a national trust bank have there been any changes in regulation or rules related to your current structure or any can you give some perspective on that walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i think its a matter of certainly the situation as you look at the indiscernible and what they felt about with the regional bank situation would they really want to now expand into a state and we just felt the probability was not there and were quite comfortable with the ph fsb at this stage and we withdrew it rather and it was just again they were working on decisioning it and we just felt that we would withdraw based on the financial circumstances you know what we still have again the capability so it doesnt really affect us but thats the story with the regional bank and the other situations the environment just we felt was not there thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi and walter do you expect there to be any changes on capital where you might have to hold more or is that less certain just any perspective on that walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so from our standpoint as part of our steady state planning certainly the differential if anything you probably would have a tick up on a state situation and we certainly understood that but no the short answer to the question is no we do not because of this situation with the state or with the ph fsb we do not anticipate other than what the fed is evaluating right based on the situations that theyve seen and we would be just like anybody else whats the size of our balance sheet impacted for that level thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 got you next question just can you comment on any updates on risk transfer on the rps side is that still it sounded like you went through a more thorough process you emerged from it saying you didnt like the pricing yet youre seeing a lot of competitors in the life insurance space do further risk transfer deals so that trend continues and its pretty good pricing actually on some of the recent deals so curious if thats changed at all your perspective whether the competitor pricing or where do you stand on overall risk transfer thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i think more importantly where we stand with holdings certainly we feel very comfortable with what we have as we look at it and then yes certainly evaluated situations as weve always said weve looked at it many of the stuff in the past has been distressed yes weve seen some changes there and certainly we are not going outbound ph and if certainly inbounds come in we evaluate them so but we are very comfortable where we are right now thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi but would you say nothings really changed on your view that theres still too wide of a bidask spread relative to what you think the value of your book is versus the type of pricing thats out there walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc certainly weve seen changes shifting with the books that are going but again we dont do a detailed analysis and we actually evaluate facts and circumstance as it relates to us james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i mean we havent gone through an indepth of whats recently occurred and what may happen in the market i think from our perspective right now we have a very solid business there we have a very low risk profile for that business as walter said its going to continue to generate roughly million of pti a quarter million for a year most of that is free cash flow for us so thats how we think about it but if there are opportunities that arise well always have to entertain them thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thanks operator the next question is from craig siegenthaler with bank of america your line is open craig siegenthaler q analyst bofa securities inc thanks good morning everyone so next quarter youre going to have your annual insurance liability unlocking exercise and last year resulted in a large negative adjustment with the bear market effect or on the variable annuity book this year markets are up a lot interest rates are up a lot so my question is should we get a reversal on the unlocking last year just given the bull market that were in and also could there be a release in the longterm care block just given that interest rates are a lot higher ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes the interest rates will ph cap but listen there is a balance between the equity markets and the interest markets so from that standpoint looking at our available ph cap thats why we came out of a ratio looking at it because youre looking at it from an ldti standpoint and from our standpoint thats why weve determined it is not the driver of it so the element is statutory from that standpoint so we feel comfortable that the market is there the interest rates certainly we youve seen our position and our excess capital has not changed sequentially so right now its we are navigating the situation and we feel very comfortable with it so as rate as environments change we have the ability to certainly absorb and adjust for it and yes if we get benefits we will evaluate certainly our positioning craig siegenthaler q analyst bofa securities inc thanks walter my followup and i think i know your answer here but i just kind of want to hear it anyway you stopped some fixed annuities you insured your book to kkrs global atlantic but weve watched the all to acquire these books pretty aggressively and now interest rates are back to healthy levels roes on these portfolios are higher and the product isnt that complicated its really just credit quality indiscernible so dont you have a competitive advantage with your large distribution channel in wealth and you seem pretty happy with your decision but dont higher interest rates versus the last 15plus years changed the calculus on the fixed annuity business too walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well yes listen fixed annuities has certainly gotten back in favor from that standpoint and we will evaluate it but it also has implications from a balance sheet standpoint in surrender out of surrender and certainly portfolio we feel very comfortable with like you said with the reinsurance situation and there but we are constantly evaluating well go back into manufacturing or not and right now i think were comfortable with where we are but certainly yes there are advantages to it and it ebbs and flows we do know that right as rates go up and down you have implications from a liquidity and other standpoint with that portfolio thats why we basically felt very comfortable reinsuring it craig siegenthaler q analyst bofa securities inc thank you walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc but certainly we continue rps group continues to evaluate and make a recommendation on it as we look at it but we are i can say right now were good craig siegenthaler q analyst bofa securities inc thanks ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 operator and the next question is from ryan krueger with kbw your line is open ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi thanks good morning you mentioned the the to basis points of yield uplift within the bank would you expect much if any higher deposit costs or interest costs along with that or should that predominantly drop to the bottom line walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc that factored in i was giving you actually the asset earning rate on that going and that was the question that was what i was referring to or as that we would just add to cost of funds for the bank as we look at the situation where it sources which is primarily coming out of the sweep accounts ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then youve seen the certificate balance increase this year i think youre rolling out more products within the bank at some point should we expect some of the certificate balances to roll off the group into the bank and if so is there much of a margin difference between the two walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah if you look at it from that standpoint the indiscernible on certificates in the bank should be comparable and yes we have built up and we just as jim indicated we launched our bank certificate product so we will certainly have that offering to people but right now were not anticipating big shifts coming in but were certainly giving them the capability within a short product ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you operator the next question is from jeff schmitt with william blair your line is open jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc hi thanks i have another question on brokerage sweep rates they appear to be pretty flat from last quarter and the deposit beta seems to have slowed for the industry and just wondering if theres potential for you to increase your sweep rate if the fed sort of keeps raising interest rates or are competitive levels such that you may not need to raise it much anymore walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc listen we have a very robust valuation system that goes on to ensure we offer competitive rates in that and we are now evaluating the team is now evaluating yes so you will see as we look at the competitive environment ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 and landscape that we will evaluate then our deposit beta and increase rates accordingly to ensure that we offer our clients competitive rates thats a very focused program we have jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc yeah okay and then just on capital return i think its running at of operating earnings in the first half i know in the past youve sort of targeted or at least for the full year i mean should we expect it to move up to that or is there any reason its sort of running below that longterm target walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well right now we established this year we said our target for this year is going to be obviously it can go up and down a quarter from that standpoint and were still comfortable with that right now staying with that guidance jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc okay thank you operator we have no further questions at this time and this concludes todays conference thank you for
