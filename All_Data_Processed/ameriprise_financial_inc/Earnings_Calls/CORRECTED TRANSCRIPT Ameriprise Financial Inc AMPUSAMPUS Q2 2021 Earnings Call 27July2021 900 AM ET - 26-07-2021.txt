expansion since the fed cut short term rates a year ago moving to retirement protection solutions results were good and we continue to advance our strategic initiatives with regard to annuities we had strong variable annuity sales with total sales up from a year ago this was driven by increased demand for both our structured variable annuity product and our rava product without living benefits together this represented over twothirds of sales in the quarter a continuation of the shift that were driving on the insurance side life and health insurance sales approximately doubled driven by our vul product which is appropriate product for this rate environment now lets discuss asset management where we continue to grow the business consistent with our clients assets under management rose to

remain excellent sales and flows traction is broadbased with of our investment capabilities generating over million of net inflows in the quarter and in emea retail sales have been weaker given the

balance sheet our capital management is excellent the business continues to generate substantial free cash flow and were freeing up additional capital in fact the approximately million of our reinsurance deal largely pays for the bmo acquisition giving us additional flexibility to return capital to shareholders at an attractive rate in summary ameriprise is in a terrific position were performing well and generating strong results our team is serving more clients and deepening relationships were delivering excellent organic growth in both wealth and asset management and the bmo transaction will add an additional growth opportunity and were accelerating our business mix shift with the reinsurance of the fixed annuity block id like to close by talking about our team our people

are safe to do so while maintaining a level of flexibility now ill turn it over to walter and then take your questions walter stanley berman chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc thank you jim ameriprise delivered very strong financial results across the firm with adjusted operating eps up to we continue to demonstrate excellent metrics earnings growth and margin expansion in our core growth businesses of advice wealth management and asset management sales of our retirement protection products were up significantly from last year and were focused in low risk and highermargin offerings were already seeing a shift in our inforce block and expect this to continue going forward as jim mentioned in the quarter we continue to advance our strategic priorities to expand our growth businesses and reduce our risk profile we remain on track to close the acquisition of bmos emea asset management business in the fourth quarter which will expand our core geographic and product capabilities in attractive and growing market segments additionally we entered into an agreement to reinsure approximately billion of fixed annuities and closed on the riversource life transaction in early july as noted we will free up approximately million of capital and will have a marginal projected impact on fixed annuity profitability in addition to the reinsurance transaction we continue to effectively manage our risk profile through product mix shift to lower risk and highermargin retirement protection solutions offerings our diversified model generates robust free cash flow and strong balance sheet fundamentals we returned of adjusted op earnings to shareholders in the quarter aligning us to our projected target for the full year lets turn to slide in the quarter ameriprise adjusted operating net revenues grew and ph pti increased reflecting continued excellent business performance revenue and earnings in our capitallight businesses of awm and asset management drove nearly of the total excluding corporate and other a significant shift from a year ago even normalizing for the unusually high earnings in rps last year we remain disciplined on expenses ga expenses were well managed up given the strong business growth in the ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2021 quarter overall we delivered another excellent quarter that underscores the strength of the business model that continues to yield robust profitable growth turning to slide advice wealth management delivered another quarter of excellent organic growth with total client assets up to billion total client flows were billion the third consecutive quarter of total client flows at or above billion demonstrating the sustainability of our organic growth our focus is not only on growth but profitable growth in the quarter our pretax adjusted operating margin was an increase of basis points from the prior year and an increase of basis points sequentially despite continued low interest rates on page financial results in advice wealth management were very strong with pretax adjusted operating earnings of million up adjusted operating net revenues grew to billion fueled by robust client flows and a increase in transactional activity in addition to strong market appreciation on a sequential basis revenue increased nicely to ameriprise bank continues to grow at a solid pace reaching nearly billion in the quarter after adding million of sweep cash to the balance sheet expenses remain well managed and we continue to exhibit strong expense discipline ga expense increased reflecting increased activity and the timing of performancebased compensation expense going forward we remain committed to managing expense and margin in a disciplined manner turning to page asset management delivered another strong quarter driven by excellent investment performance and sustained inflows resulting in outstanding financial results net inflows were billion excluding legacy insurance partners which is a continuation of an improved solid flow trend adjusted operating revenues increased to million a result of the cumulative benefit of net inflows and market appreciation on a sequential basis revenues were up our fee rate remains strong at basis points reflecting the strong momentum we are seeing across the board with strength in both equity and fixed income strategies expenses remain well managed and in line with expectation given the revenue environment ga expenses grew primarily from the timing of compensation expense related to strong business performance as well as foreign exchange translation and higher volumerelated expenses as with awm going forward we will manage the expense tightly pretax adjusted operating earnings grew and we delivered a margin moving forward we expect strong financial performance to continue and anticipate that margins will remain in the mid range over the near term driven by current robust equity markets lets turn to page retirement protection solutions continue to perform in line with expectations in this environment pretax adjusted operating earnings were million sales in the quarter were up significantly off a low base in the prior year driven by the pandemic sales were above precovid levels resulting in an increase in distribution expense in the quarter additionally earnings in the prior year were positively impacted by the lower surrenders and withdrawals relating to the pandemic environment importantly we continue to reduce our risk profile by growing sales of retirement products without living benefits retirement sales increased during the quarter with twothirds of the sales and products without living benefits this is shifting the overall book and now only of the r block has living benefit riders down over basis points from a year ago in protection sales nearly doubled as we continue to see a meaningful increase in highermargin vul and a significant decline in iul this mix shift in both retirement protection products are expected to continue going forward ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2021 now lets move to the balance sheet on the last slide our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong including our liquidity position of billion at the parent company and substantial excess capital of billion which does not include the capital release from the recently announced fixed annuity transaction adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at we returned million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback and we are on track with our commitment to return of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders for the year with that well take your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from brennan hawken from ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions so just a quick one on insurance here now that youve got the fixed annuity sale announced what are your plans for the rest of the insurance business it seems as though theres a decent amount of demand particularly from certain alternative asset managers to run the insurance business how should we think about the potential for you to capitalize on that demand and offer up further opportunity to monetize some of these insurance assets james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so this is jim as we said our first focus was really to execute the remaining part of our fixed annuity book which we think we were successful in doing that that was just completed in july the beginning of july and so we are continuing to look at other opportunities that may make sense for us both strategically as well as tactically for certain parts of our business and were doing that more holistically to evaluate what that does from a client perspective what it does from a companywide perspective regarding our capital situation our risk profile and also what the appetite is in the marketplace so to your point were constantly looking at that as we now completed the fixed annuity transaction and well see what opportunities may arise in the future brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that and then shifting gears another strong quarter in awm the organic growth there really quite good building on success in so to me this really underscores that ameriprise really is a wealth management firm at its core have you considered adjusting some of the awm reporting or maybe providing some enhanced reporting that would be a little bit more in line with the wealth management competitors in the marketplace and allow for a little bit more clean comparison on some of these metrics distribution revenue including some components that are yieldoriented compensation being part of distribution expense just some of these metrics that are probably really more tied to the insurance legacy of the firm dont make for the easiest comparisons to the wealth management firms and so just curious whether or not thats something youve looked at or is something youd consider ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2021 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so i think to the first comment that you made of our total business right now is really in the assetlight asset management wealth management segments with the wealth management really even driving the components of whatever is remaining in our retirement business which is actually a highreturning subset of the company but if you take that to your point we have been moving more in that direction of disclosing more of that type of segmented results for our wealth and asset management i know alicia and team working with our finance people are looking at all those things and just like we introduced some of those additional metrics as you would imagine we have to go back and make sure that all the data and everything is consistent quartertoquarter how we look at it to track it et cetera so were doing that now and well come out with some other things as we move forward but we want to make sure that were just doing that in a way that is consistent with both the industry but also that were able to report it appropriately brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that color operator our next question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great good morning guys thanks for taking the question so first wanted to start with maybe a little bit of a deeper update on bmo emea asset management acquisition so jim heard you guys saying that the flow is still positive which is great and the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter but now that youve had maybe a little bit more time kind of working through the transaction maybe an update on sort of run rate revenues and pretax margins in that business and how you think these margins eventually are going to look like once youre fully integrated with columbia threadneedle james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so alex as you would imagine a little different than a us acquisition being in the international marketplace in europe we do not have as much access to underlying information as you would have normally thought in sort of where youre already in a deal in contract because of privacy and all the limitations there so it sort of gives us a little bit of a delay in what were able to really look at in a much more detailed equation to look at the expenses the details of that the various aspects underlying the absolutes to really then come up with what we would consider combination of run rates and synergies and other things so were just going to have to wait a bit and its not all usual but its one that were we know that thats what is required at this point in time so we will definitely provide that to you as we continue to gain information for that so were not holding it its just more that we dont really have it at the level that we would feel comfortable disclosing something that could change ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2021 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you all right well stay tuned for that james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc its not that we dont feel good about it its just more that its not something that we can be accurately reporting on alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i got you i hear you second question walter maybe just your view on ga outlook at a firmwide level i know there are moving pieces between awm and asset management but as you think about ga holistically for ameriprise off of kind of 820ish million run rate in the second quarter how should we think of that for the rest of the year and maybe even into given theres some evidence of inflationary pressures building in asset management compensation and things like that walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc okay alex first let me start off i think as we look at the results for the second quarter were managing expenses in a pretty disciplined way and certainly correlated to our revenue growth we do expect going forward that we are going to continue to have good strong revenue growth so therefore the expenses will correlate to that but we will manage in a disciplined way the thing that i would say at this stage alex is that we are seeing we are going to start spending in development and other things but its going to be measured and certainly indiscernible we do not see inflationary pressures yet certainly our compensation is up as we talked about because of the performance characteristics this year versus last year but from our standpoint the underlying expenses are being well managed and we will continue to spend money as its prudent but you could expect that therere going to be disciplined approach to it but we dont see the inflation right now just the normal increase that you will see with top performance that were having alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks if i could just sneak one more in and a little bit in the weeds but i was curious about the point jim you made around pledge loans in the bank can you guys give us a balance of those loans in the second quarter versus what it was in the first quarter sort of the yield that you guys are earning there and the outlook for future growth definitely seems like one of the ways to grow the banks nii in a bit of a unique way james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc i dont have that in front of me walter walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2021 no i dont have the it is growing and right now the way we operate with our thirdparty partner is we basically do the share in the underwriting and pay a certain expense so the growth potential there is very good i just dont have the number at hand at this stage james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and alex since we just more fully launched this across the system in the fourth quarter of last year we rolled it out its starting to really percolate so what i would probably say is that were in very early innings but i think based on the appetite as well as where that fits in i think it will be a nice growth area for us but i would probably say its still in the early stages but one thats growing nicely and hopefully will lead to some larger balances over time alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it okay thanks guys operator our next question comes from erik bass from autonomous research erik bass q analyst autonomous research hi thank you starting with awm can you talk a bit more about the client trends and the outlook for transactional activity and where are you seeing most of the wrap flows coming from james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so i think what we saw is a consistent pickup after last years sort of low period particularly on longerterm contracts so as you saw i mean our sales of retirement protection solutions activity really picked up strongly whether its maybe our vul product or its our structured or even our rava product which has no living benefits and so i think now as you look at the market environment and you look at the ability for our advisors to feel more comfortable actually executing those type of transactions in the environment and with the clients even combination of remote and inperson that has picked up nicely now for other transaction activity we see good activity there as well and we had a pickup generally both in there and wrap all through these periods so the wrap business is really coming from both new client inflows as well as new clients that were adding and we had good client acquisition also during the period and the flows also were strong so i think its a combination of those factors i dont think theres one in particular i think the environment particularly with low interest rates now that people are looking for how do they get out a more return more holistically in our wrap program we do do balance portfolios and diversify it pretty well so that theres a level of what we would call not just overreliance on the equity markets but not and the same time just looking for yield from fixed income and so i think its a combination of those factors i dont know if that answers your question but as you saw it continued from the latter part of last year all through the first half of this year erik bass q analyst autonomous research ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2021 got it yeah i guess i was thinking about just the sustainability of the organic growth rate so do you think theres still some dry powder from existing clients to drive flows into wrap or is it transitioning more where you james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc no i think erik bass q analyst autonomous research need new assets coming into the platform james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i would say its not just the transition i mean as we said if you look at even though we have strong sales of our annuities its still down a few hundred million in net flows because were not really putting out there the ph variable with the guarantees et cetera but we had a nice pickup on those that didnt have it but having said that i feel there is a continuation in the wrap and that continuation will come not just from a mix shift per se i dont think thats where the large part is were maintaining very large cash balances still and our flows in are also very good erik bass q analyst autonomous research okay thank you and you mentioned the impact of low interest rates just a quick one there what are you doing i guess to mitigate the impact of low rates on the bank and certificate products and then on the other hand if we do start to see higher interest rates has anything changed versus the last tightening cycle in terms of your sensitivity to upside james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc no in fact i think we sort of hit we feel like we hit a low point i mean if youre looking at what is discussed of whether inflations there or not there what the fed may do or not do it looks like theres more of the potential for it to go back with rates going up ill let walter speak to a little bit of the actual rates or what were doing with the bank to complement that walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc well obviously the bank is very opportunistic now because obviously if you look at our sweep account rates theyre basis points and where now new money is being placed at ph basis points were putting an emphasis on more duration than credit so were seizing upon the opportunity to be prudent about it not to extend you on credit but certainly investing out and picking up that spread and you should anticipate there will be more sweep money to play on balance sheet erik bass q analyst autonomous research got it thank you ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2021 operator our next question comes from john barnidge from piper sandler john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you very much with longterm care experience in the second quarter would you say thats back to completely normalized levels or do you think it comes down more i know in march it was about million in earnings on the call walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah its walter so listen one month two months dont make a trend but yes the numbers that were seeing are certainly returning to the precovid situation yes john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then my followup how should we be thinking about timing and efforts to reduce any stranded costs left with the fixed annuity transaction walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc well okay as part of our program we are certainly always evaluate and reengineer and the stranded cost again is manageable from the fixed annuities based upon the expense base it had in the allocation elements that we feel comfortable that well be able to neutralize that as we do our reengineering and evaluate within the rps product and also across the firm so we will be able to neutralize a majority of it john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc youre welcome operator our next question comes from humphrey lee from dowling partners humphrey lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc good morning and thank you for taking my questions just to follow up on awm activities given the strong ph wrap flows and transactional activities but as you think about it how much of that would you attribute that to pentup demand since last year versus the productivity gains from the actions youve taken and how do you think about that going forward james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2021 yes so i think a combination so again we know the market conditions are favorable we know the equity markets are strong and that always lends itself to a consumer appetite to some speak about being comfortable investing i think part of it is not just the market but sort of the economy reopening and the feeling that theres not going to be a big shoe to drop so to speak in the near term i would also say that part of it is definitely the capabilities we put in place and the engagement we have with our advisors weve done a lot over the last few years just the idea is like were one of the few firms that were able to like fully operate virtually with all of our capabilities with not losing a beat with our advisors or engagement with the clients our digital activities with the clients and the advisors is very strong we keep on adding capabilities there we are integrating everything in an ecosystem that works together not just putting tools on a platform and saying hey we got this service and look how great it is and usually when we talk to you about it its not something like we just like thought of or just introduced or just added its something that we really have tested out weve proven weve actually rolled it out and it really works well and so i would just say that has aided a lot to our advisors having this type of engagement with their clients and also with the way theyre able to transact with the firm and the information that were providing so i think its a combination of all of that i mean i cant sit here and tell you how much we got from each what i could tell you is the feedback from our advisors are very positive about what we have enabled for them and how thats operating as theyre working through things including some of the capabilities weve added on the whole advice modules and what that does in client flows so thats why we feel good about our system and we feel like when we do discuss these things with you its not vaporware its not something that we just like introduced and were making a big marketing play on it its something that we feel really comfortable that has been executed humphrey lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc so it sounds like if market conditions continue to be favorable or at least stable at least for the nearterm that the current kind of activities level should be at least sustainable in the nearterm is that the right way to think about it james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes i cant sit here and tell you theres anything that we see has changed there from what were seeing i mean as i mentioned to you at yearend and in the first quarter i mean i dont have a perfect crystal ball and if the market fell out or the economic situation changed or covid jumped back up in some fashion that closed parts of the economy we may see some effect but i think as were just chugging along right now we dont see anything materially changing that outlook and so again as i said in the first quarter no crystal ball but we feel good about the continuation of what we have humphrey lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc got it my second question is related to asset management the margin clearly was very favorable this quarter but at the same time adding the bmo block will likely lower your overall margin for the segment given the ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2021 business mix but if the market conditions remain stable any reason why the margin at columbia threadneedle would not remain in that low to mid percent range kind of going forward james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc no i would say this we actually feel like if europe improves a bit and our flows turn around there margins will be a bit higher i mean outside of foreign exchange et cetera we think that would be a possibility even if you saw even where theres a level of margin compression or institutional flows or a little low fee base weve been able to maintain a basis points over the course of the year that spread because we are winning some mandates and getting good flows in certain of our products that have the fees i think europe uk would actually be favorable if that started to turn around to add to that bmo is not a negative at all i mean thats what youre doing is youre weighing in like 100andsomething billion of assets that have an institutional base mainly and with that they have a lower fee but we think the revenue contribution will be positive in the float situation we can make positive as well and so really thats all youre doing is youre doing the math but if you said youre at the now and that will stay and then you just add the institutional adding that component it will come to whatever the number comes to and well provide that to you as soon as we get a more finetuned breakout of it but i would say theres nothing that i would sit here to tell you would change in that regard at this point humphrey lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc okay so but it sounds like for columbia threadneedle theres still more kind of operating leverage that you can get as james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah humphrey lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc if europe turn around okay got it thanks operator our next question comes from andrew kligerman from credit suisse andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc hey good morning maybe just to quickly follow up on humphreys last question about advice wealth so billion plus in wrap flows for three quarters in a row youre sitting at billion in cash or north of that actually these are more than double or around double the numbers we would have seen two years ago before the pandemic so i just want to make sure this is the new normal then james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2021 well i think andrew its an excellent question and i think youre right i mean were sitting here sometimes and we compare it to a little of the level of activity that we saw just prior quarters or year i think if you do go back to our level of activity or productivity our margins on that productivity and the amount of flow activity has definitely increased we do feel were more productive we do feel that were starting to hit on sort of the right channels for that growth but i mean if i can define the billion or billion is there something from some pentup yeah there is something probably in there but to your point our cash balances are up as well so its not as though we lowered the amount thats sitting in cash and just moved it into wrap so i think youre right in what youre concluding i was just trying to sort of talk about it more from a yearoveryear basis andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc okay and maybe just following a little bit up on brennans question these ma blocks are pretty active out there maybe you could i could take it from a different angle is are you getting a lot of incoming calls and with those calls maybe even a consideration that going forward you would manufacture and ultimately reinsure the product as you move forward on new business walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc andrew its walter as jim indicated certainly we are getting inbounds were evaluating both from a tactical and strategic standpoint and i would say there is clearly interest and certainly were looking at the best shareholder implications to it taking into consideration all aspects including pe multiple and certainly recognizing the quality of the book but we are certainly getting inbounds andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc awesome maybe just lastly so the round trip of excess capital will be around billion after bmo and the fixed annuity block gets completed and youre doing a great payout ratio of about any sense of the possibility that you might ramp that up a bit in the back half of the year and next year james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc i think andrew at this point we want to execute the bmo transaction we just completed the fixed annuity as we said to you even before we did those things we would target a nice return which were doing and were consistent with that so you can keep that as sort of our base right now but i think it will depend on market conditions in a sense of what opportunity arises in that regard and it gives us also flexibility so i dont want to commit to anything at this point we want to complete the bmo transaction as we go through and see how the environment is but i would just say its a real positive to have the hand andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc okay thank you operator our next question comes from tom gallagher from evercore thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2021 good morning first question just on walter how we should think about corporate following the closing of the fa deal are we going to see an amortization of the negative ph seed flowing through corporate and can you give some indication for what the earnings impacts going to be going forward walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc so yes again we havent finalized exactly but its a reasonable positioning to put it in corporate and yes there will be amortization of the negative ph seed but let me put this in context as we evaluated certainly the fa book and its ph projectory going forward it was this transaction ph was going to be a positive from a pl standpoint certainly you would see as you project it will be higher than what youre seeing right now but all the projections are it will be certainly pl positive to us as we go forward and that does not even take into consideration the use of proceeds as it relates to the freed up capital so its risk and pl wise as you look over the term of this and certainly the freed up capital aspects of it theyre certainly very positive james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so tom it would be positive to what we would be experience if we maintain the fixed annuity book and the losses from that on a relative i mean on an absolute sense it will still be some negative in each quarter but walter the size of the negative per quarter walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc youre going to see okay right now you saw in this quarter we had million loss so as you look out to it in its going to get pretty close to when the amortization and the other aspects of it will equal pretty much probably million a quarter something in that range james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc okay andrew tom does that make sense to you thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc that does yeah and thats and walter thats i presume thats noncash walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah thats exactly right because indiscernible thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc okay walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2021 is the amortization right james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc right and thats not the and that does not include like the use of capital if we were to use it for buyback or other things so to offset that but what i would say is if we held it you would have had higher numbers but this was a very reasonable and appropriate way and it also freed up that amount of capital upfront rather than just over time thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc that makes sense and just to come back to the question of potential risk transfer so the fixed annuity deals done i heard everything you guys have said about that youre getting inbound calls and youre evaluating things if we think about well call it the most likely path of outcomes here would it be something similar to fa where you might do a slice of your remaining risk whether thats life insurance variable annuities even longterm care or would you be open to doing something far more strategic like a full divestiture of riversource life and i dont know how closely youve really looked at it yet but when you think about the drag on your valuation and your multiple today from those businesses compared to bidask spreads in the market do you have any sort of sense for whether you think it could be a meaningful positive and something bigger would make sense or do you think its more going to be more bitesized transactions james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so tom its an excellent question and what i would say is were evaluating a lot of different aspects so as an example if something optimizes us for slices we will look at that as something strategic that merely makes sense from what were doing for our system or a client et cetera it makes sense well evaluate it so its not as though were just being myopic at this point were looking at it more holistic we will look at what that generates for shareholders as well as what it is from a client value proposition but when i say that i look at it so just think about it for that thats remaining again outside of the ltc which we manage and its not going to be an earnings for us the rest of the business that we have right now generates a very good return now there are subsets like low interest rates or like the iul book is not as lucrative as the vul and other things like that but even our annuity book has very good return its well risked even the guarantee portion and well managed and so if there are ph aspects that are favorable for us to evaluate something different then we also take into account the pe well evaluate if there are subsets that like we did with the fixed annuity that sort of optimizes the book right now as other things unfold well look at that as well so i cant sit here and give you a perfect again view of the crystal ball but were open and thinking about what makes sense but we look at all aspects of that not just the financial aspect in the short term thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc thats good color appreciate it jim james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2021 thank you operator our next question comes from suneet kamath from citi suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks good morning i wanted to go back to awm for a second jim you had mentioned that you had brought in i think experienced advisors which is about half of what you guys would normally do i know you said theres some focus on reopening et cetera but can you talk about the competitive environment for advisors and do you think you could get back to that kind of 80ish plus advisor recruiting per quarter kind of in the near term james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes suneet so i think listen as we went through the quarter we didnt expect it to slow down as much but for a combination again we cant put a fine point on it but in speaking to our people et cetera it wasnt that there wasnt strong interest and that were having good conversations but its sort of where like some people who were there wanted to delay it some people didnt want to sort of like well the reopening and what im looking at of the markets or ph what they are et cetera so right now our pipeline looks really good and we feel like well get back to those numbers and thats really and maybe even a little more favorable but i would probably say it was just the way it came now is there a competitive market absolutely theres a competitive market and were being disciplined as well because we dont want to just if its not right for us we dont jump at it just like we want it right for the advisor were recruiting in that we can help them be successful but i would probably say the second quarter i wouldnt attribute it to competitive frame i could contribute it to a confluence of factors and thats really what im getting from my people so as i said im not coming up with that myself its really what i got as feedback as i went through the system suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay that makes sense and then just a few quick production questions first in asset management on the north american retail business can you give a sense of where the growth is coming from in terms of channels how much of it is awm versus the thirdparty intermediaries and then ill have a followup for awm james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so we have strong flows across our system in the us in retail as well as we had some nice flows in institutional in the retail its actually across the combination of those channels weve actually picked up share in most of the intermediary in awm its just theyre getting their similar share just that our growth is strong and so theyre getting a piece of that action so theyre no different than the third parties as far as what were seeing in the pickup but its across and also i think we did mention that its not in just one or two disciplines we have a range of products that are actually getting and i think if you looked at the industry outside of passive there was a bit more of a slowdown like in the equity sales in the active our equity has held up pretty well so even though there was a little bit of a slowing in certain aspects it was still quite good so we feel good about the retail and the consistency of it and the variety of products that were putting in the market i think where we had a little more softness was really in europe we had ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2021 positives in europe uk was weaker previously and now europe slowed down a little just because of what happened in the environment but were hoping that will bounce back suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay that makes sense and then the last one i had on production i think this might have been asked before and i didnt hear the answer but i apologize if you said it and i missed it but in terms of the wrap flows can you give us a sense of how much of that is coming from sort of the newer advisors maybe that you added over the past couple of years versus the sort of what i would call installed base folks that have been around for a while james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc were seeing so on the new advisors we can see the consistency of the rampup our rampup has actually improved a bit and were actually on a relative basis for the industry quite good were at the higher end of that but i would probably see the flows are really coming from the combination of factors but the legacy advisors are really generating good flows organic flows suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay great thanks so much operator we have no further questions at this time thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference thank you for participating you may now disconnect
