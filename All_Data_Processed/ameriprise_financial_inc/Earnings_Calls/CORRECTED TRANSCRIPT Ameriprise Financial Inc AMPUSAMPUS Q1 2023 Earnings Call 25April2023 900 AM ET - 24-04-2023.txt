continues to be among the best across financial services our assets under management and administration ended the quarter at trillion its down from a year ago due to lower markets and a negative impact from foreign exchange translation which was partially offset by our strong client flows lets turn to business highlights in advice wealth management we delivered another excellent quarter were bringing in strong flows as we focus on providing more advice to more clients and deepening our relationships client inflows continue to be robust more than billion in the quarter up and very close to an alltime high and this builds on our record year in both wrap flows and transactional activities were impacted due to ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023

structured annuity product is our ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 best seller combined with our rava annuities without living benefits and in our life

even with slower sales we continue to generate good earnings up from a year ago in fact last year our life company was ranked as the second highest returning company in the industry now lets turn to our asset management business weve been impacted by market volatility and industrywide sales pressure however the business continues to perform well and generated good returns and margin assets under management was billion at the end of the first quarter down from a year ago largely driven by lower markets and the impact of negative foreign exchange translation regarding flows total outflows were billion excluding legacy insurance partner flows in us retail like others in active management we remain in net outflows as gross sales were pressured from market volatility that said redemptions are better sequentially in emea our flows improved a bit from a year ago in institutional we had another good quarter we had inflows of billion excluding legacy insurance partner flows driven by wins in fixed income real estate and ldi expanding our alternatives capability is a longterm priority including global real estate where we are building out the business and earned a large mandate in the quarter with regard to investment performance we continue to have stronger longterm performance across equities fixed income and asset allocation strategies while our oneyear numbers were impacted by market volatility primarily in certain fixed income strategies were starting to see those numbers come back this year as interest rates stabilize and given our strength in credit and we maintain and morningstar rated funds globally across regions were earning important recognition including recent lipper awards and other accolades in addition to focusing on investment performance we continue to work through our emea integration we plan to complete much of it by the latter part of the year and look forward to deriving additional synergies in asset management we also continue to manage ga

financial officer ameriprise financial inc thank you as jim said results this quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of the ameriprise value proposition as adjusted eps increased to wealth management business momentum higher interest rates and expense discipline more than offset the equity and fixed income market dislocation over the past year this reinforced the value of our diversified business model wealth management earnings grew and represented of the firms adjusted operating earnings a new record this is up from a year ago ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 asset management was challenged with industry flow pressures as well as substantial market impacts to aum and retirement protection solutions delivered a good growth primarily from opportunistically repositioning the investment portfolio as well as from the lower sales levels given the environment across the firm we continue to manage expenses tightly relative to the revenue opportunity within each segment as a result we continue to make investments in the bank and other growth initiatives particularly in wealth management by prudently managing overall firmwide expenses in the quarter ga was down our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong and we saw limited impacts from the significant market disruption in the quarter our portfolio is positioned well and no assets are accounted for as held to maturity we have strong capital and liquidity positions as well as effective hedging this allowed us to return million of capital to shareholders a strong return at of our operating earnings lets turn to slide assets under managementadministration ended the quarter at trillion down while auma benefited from strong client flows we experienced significant market impacts equity and fixed markets were down and respectively yearoveryear in addition asset management aum levels were substantially impacted by weakening of the pound and euro resulting in nonus aum down to approximately of the total the portfolio effect of our business mix garnered robust earnings growth with pretax earnings up from last year with meaningful benefits from strong client flows and interest rates more than offsetting significant negative equity and fixed income markets and foreign exchange impacts free cash flow generation remains strong lets turn to individual segment performance beginning with our strongest growth business wealth management on slide wealth management client assets declined to billion strong organic growth in client flows was more than offset by significant market depreciation over the past year total client net flows remained strong at billion up from last year evenly split between wrap accounts and nonadvisory accounts our flexible model and broad offering allow advisors and clients to pivot as markets and client preferences shift while keeping money within the system revenue per advisor reached in the quarter up from the prior year from higher spread revenue enhanced productivity and business growth turning to slide id like to provide some additional insights into the sustainability of our client cash the safety of these deposits and our investment approach in managing cash that is at our bank and certificate companies our cash balances are relatively stable in total at billion in the quarter and about of total client assets while there is some seasonality with cash levels particularly with tax payments in march and april cash has always been a component within the client asset allocation and generally remains above of client assets sweep cash specifically has an average size of per account and over of the cash is in accounts with less than as i mentioned we have a broad set of product offerings to meet our client needs across environments from a cash perspective we have our sweep cash and certificate offerings with many options for clients seeking yield and looking to ladder their liquidity in the quarter we launched a new savings account option within the bank and well be adding a preferred savings account and broker cd later this year lastly we have no assets that are accounted for as held to maturity and our portfolios are constructed under the rigor of our asset liability modeling approach our bank portfolio is aaa rated with a 31year duration the overall ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 yield on the portfolio is and the yield on investments made in the first quarter was over our certificate company portfolio is highly liquid with over of the portfolio in cash governments and agencies it is aa rated and on average with a 08year duration the yield on this portfolio was and purchases in the quarter were at a yield of on slide we delivered extremely strong results in the wealth management on all fronts profitability increased in the quarter with strong organic growth and the benefit of higher interest rates offsetting the impacts from market depreciation pretax operating margin reached nearly up over basis points yearoveryear and up basis points sequentially adjusted operating expenses declined with distribution expenses down reflecting lower transactional activity and asset balances ga is up in the quarter as we continue to invest for growth including the bank lets turn to asset management on slide we are managing the business well through a challenging market total assets under management declined to billion primarily from equity and fixed income market depreciation and negative foreign exchange impact asset management like the industry was in outflows in the quarter continued strength in our global institutional business offset a meaningful portion of retail outflows like others we experienced pressure from global market volatility a riskoff investor sentiment and continued geopolitical strain in emea as a reminder flows in the prior year included billion related to the us asset transfer associated with the bmo acquisition on slide you can see asset management financial results reflected the market environment as anticipated earnings declined to million reflecting market depreciation foreign currency weakening and outflows as well as lower performance fees than a year ago importantly we continue to manage the areas we can control expenses remain well managed total expenses were down aided by a decline in ga which benefited from lower performance fee compensation we continue to make marketdriven tradeoffs and discretionary spending and remain committed to managing expenses very tightly in the current revenue environment margins in the quarter improved sequentially to returning to our targeted range of to lets turn to slide retirement protection solutions continued to deliver good earnings and free cash flow generation reflecting the high quality of the business as you are aware the longduration target improvements accounting change went into effect in the first quarter our current period and historic results are now being reported under this framework while this accounting change impacts gaap equity and earnings it does not impact our dividend capacity excess capital or cash flow generation which are based upon statutory accounting framework in the quarter pretax adjusted operating earnings was million up from the prior year primarily as a result of higher investment yields from the portfolio repositioning we executed over the past six months we estimate that ldti will reduce rps earnings by approximately million for full year versus the million impact in as it relates to the year we remain comfortable with the million run rate taking into consideration the impact of ldti and the benefit from portfolio repositioning and higher rates sales in the quarter similar to the industry declined as a result of the volatile market environment as well as management action to discontinue sales of variable annuities with living benefits to further reduce the risk profile of the business protection sales remain concentrated in highermargin asset accumulation vul which now represents over onethird of the total insurance in force annuity sales in the quarter were in lowerrisk products without guarantees and structured variable annuities these products represent over of our total va account value ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 now lets move to the balance sheet on slide our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong and our diversified highquality investment portfolio remains well positioned in total the average credit rating of the portfolio is aa with only of the portfolio in below investmentgrade securities despite significant market dislocation in the quarter va hedging effect in this remains very strong at our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable free cash flow contribution from all business segments this supports the consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders even during periods of market depreciation in light of the ldti accounting change we incorporated a new nongaap disclosure in our earnings release of available capital for capital adequacy this represents how we manage capital and is unchanged as a result of ldti during the quarter we returned million to shareholders and still ended the quarter with billion of excess capital and billion of holding company liquidity with that well take your questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions well take our first question this morning from brennan hawken of ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions id love to start on cash and the outlook for rate earnings in awm so youve seen growth in certificates you mentioned a highyield offering in the bank that you just launched and then further brokered cds and certainly this will satisfy demand for yield that we see for cash equivalents but do you think that the current level of nii can be maintained going forward is the increasing deposit costs enough to offset the shift to the bank or are you able is the shift to the bank able to keep things steady here at the current levels thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc okay so yes the answer is yes what we are seeing in that certainly we looking at the way the sweep accounts have performed that we have the opportunity to shift more into the bank and well be evaluating that because of basically the way that its performed right now and that will give us additional yield as it relates to that and also we also see on the search that we will based on timing we will also see that the spread will increase in that so we guess the answer is absolutely yes both from shifting additional funds into the bank which has a higher profitability and also the certs as we look at the spread increasing from a timing standpoint as we adjust so yes the answer is yes brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you for that and then at this point through april youve moved billion which i believe you previously indicated as your plan for the year do you plan to move further balances into the bank and then beyond the balance transfers do you expect that these new savings offerings could allow you to actually see organic nontransfer oriented growth coming out of the bank as well thanks ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc okay so on the first one yes so as we look at the sorting and certainly in the first quarter you always have the tax but weve clearly it is performing the way we thought and is slowing and that gives us the opportunity were evaluating that but we do have additional opportunity with the indiscernible and everything we have in our sweep accounts to move more in and thats what were evaluating so that would is a distinct possibility james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah and ill take your second question so we just in march launched a savings product well be launching a brokered cd in may and then a highyield savings account a bit later in the year and we see the opportunity to garner more cash from clients of bringing it in from their banking institutions now that well have some of these products but in addition to what were holding ourselves and whether its a sweep or even our certificate we have much more cash that our clients are holding externally in brokered cds they put money in that came into the firm or in money markets and so we think we can garner some of that cash back in so in total theres about billion of cash we have about billion we actually think by offering the brokered cds and things like that that well garner some of that that have gone out to banking institutions that our clients have put money in that we feel much more comfortable having them at ameriprise so we think theres an opportunity there for us as we continue to build out the bank and we are also holding a lot more cash as general so that our sweep activities is only about which is really always been around that level for transaction of to so we feel very good that there is opportunity for us brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions operator thank you well go next now to erik bass at autonomous research erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp hi thank you i guess maybe a broader question for advice and wealth and just how youre thinking about the margin from here and do you still see potential upside to margins or is your goal more to maintain them at the current kind of level james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well i think the way we look at it is listen were probably at one of the highest margins out there in the industry including the big wires that have had banking activities for a long period of time but money as i said still sitting on the sidelines in cash were holding upwards of billion some of that money are not necessarily from transactional activity if they will hold for expenses and other things some of that money will go back into wrap i mean whats a positive is we brought in billion of client flows weve been bringing in record numbers for us over the last so many quarters and that hasnt been deployed yet so as they put money back into transactions and contracts and wrap a business that will also earn us fees so i cant tell you exactly what that margin is but i ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 would say its an excellent margin and our business has some good opportunity to continue and so from my perspective i think it was a very positive quarter building on a very positive year last year erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp got it makes sense and then maybe building on your comments about organic growth i mean it has accelerated theyve been running at over annualized the past couple of quarters in wealth management can you talk a little bit about whats driven that acceleration in inflows and given the pipeline that you have and clients and advisers coming in do you see that as a sustainable run rate james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well we think so because we are our advisers are engaged weve helped them with a lot of tools and capabilities and support even in this climate we give them a lot of information and appropriate communications for their clients on market volatility we help them really help their clients stick to their goals and what they need to achieve over time balancing out the volatility we are engaging and bringing in a lot of good new client flows and deepening and were also adding highly productive advisers we added another in the quarter would have very good books of business we have a good pipeline so yes we see it continuing were adding new capabilities like our emeeting things thats going to help our advisers actually conduct even more meetings very efficiently so we feel good about how were situated in this climate erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp thank you operator thank you well go next now to craig siegenthaler at bank of america craig siegenthaler q analyst bofa securities inc thanks good morning everyone so on the back of the comerica win can you update us on your pipeline for additional financial institution group wins and how should we think about the frequency of these wins going forward and also the size range james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so weve added a number of financial institutions over the last year now the outcome was a bit larger so it was a little bit longer to orchestrate and more comprehensive based on the nature that they had their own broker deal et cetera but weve been winning business for other banks out there and financial institutions i think now were opening it so that we can work with a bit larger institutions like comerica and i think we are in a good situation we bring a lot of good capability they like our service they like the ability of what we can do to support their advisers they like the goldbased solution we provide for their clients so this is something we think we can build upon as we move forward so again i cant sit here to tell you exactly when deals get orchestrated but we have a good pipeline and we think well be adding more business there as we move forward ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 craig siegenthaler q analyst bofa securities inc great and i just had a followup on recruiting so adviser count was down very modestly on the franchise side and up a hair on the employee side but down on a total basis from last quarter so im just wondering if you could provide us any perspective on this downward trend including reminding us of any first quarter seasonality and then i wanted to hear how the bank failures in march impacted both your ability to recruit new advisers but also retain existing advisers in march and now in april because you looked pretty robust james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so no our numbers in franchisee is very strong and stable retention is very strong as with anything i mean we have so advisers there so you have some turnover in some of their assistant advisers you also have some retirements that occur in the first quarter but theres nothing different than what weve seen and the retention rate is quite strong and the assets are here so were not concerned about that as we go through succession planning et cetera as far as the pipeline we feel is very good one of the things that people have told us is they value very much what we do and what we provide but they also value the strength and the integrity of the firm and how were positioned ive mentioned a few accolades about how clients trust us but when you have a very stable institution like ameriprise that is able to really navigate these market circumstances and able to stand by their clients thats what advisers are looking for as well craig siegenthaler q analyst bofa securities inc thank you operator thank you well go next now to ryan krueger of kbw ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning my first question was on the comerica partnership can you give what type of assets are the of the billion that are coming over into your platform james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so its a mix of assets as an example advisers hold various assets that invested in the market theres a combination of wrap type of assets theres funds other things like that theres an insurance contract but what weve been able to do is show of what we can do to help those advisers and that client deepening and expand that base and add more clients to their base for the bank so we feel very good that the billion will transfer with that theres an opportunity for us to help them grow that and thats what theyre looking to do ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks and then on your initiative to introduce new savings products within the bank do you see the earnings characteristics of that as similar to the certificate balances or do you have a preference from a profitability standpoint within the bank versus certificate ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc we believe that actually it will be higher based on the investment strategy and the other elements within it so we would actually pick up the yield on that ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks and then just one last quick one the billion of total client cash you mentioned does that include cds from outside of ameriprise as well as money market funds or was that predominantly cds james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so it would include our clients our advisers putting their clients in brokered cds we have on the platform from financial institutions ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you operator well go next now to alex blostein of goldman sachs q hey guys this is ph michael on for alex i was wondering if we could maybe get an update on cash balances so far in and maybe how thats trended on a monthly basis all else equal i kind of figure out what the seasonal impact might be on taxes it sounds like you guys might have seen that in march and april already but it looks like historically that might be a to sequential impact so any update on cash balances that you can give us so far in the quarter walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i think the best we can give you from that standpoint looking at the sweep it is totally it is the basically sorting is totally slowed from that standpoint and so and as i indicated we have now for and under its more if you look at the end of the fourth quarter it was something like of the percentage of it now its almost of it so basically its very stable at that standpoint and we feel very comfortable from that standpoint that its performing the way we thought it would and so on that basis the sorting is there and we are growing on certs from that and certainly as i mentioned before we are strongly considering transferring more back into the bank once we finish our analytics on it q great thats helpful go ahead im sorry ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc no no no as i just mentioned its a seasonal element when you go from the fourth quarter to the first quarter because of the taxes i cant i dont i cant give you the exact or whatever but its certainly theres outflows related to that q thanks and then maybe for the followup can you help us maybe think through the nim impact at the bank from the upcoming maturity roll on roll off yield maybe the mix of assets between fixed and variable at the bank and what the duration profile of those might look like walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so thats an interesting point because as we mentioned we have somewhere in the area of billion rolling off and certainly that is going to the previous question increase our basically spread as it relates to it and right now as we assess it and certainly looking at the slide we continue with that same strategy and mix that we will we currently have which is the 31year duration so we feel very comfortable with that and but that redeployment of the maturing will certainly increase the yield q thank you operator thank you well go next now to jeff schmitt at william blair jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc hi thank you i may have missed it but i think you had mentioned the reinvestment rate of the bank was around at the end of last year what was it in the first quarter and do you continue to invest mainly in mbs or is that strategy shifted at all walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc the reinvestment in the bank yes so from that standpoint we are im not sure i understand the question jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc the reinvestment rate i think youd mentioned was around over at the end of last year essentially the new money yield walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i just dont knock any of your question im sorry is ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 alicia charity a senior vice president investor relations ameriprise financial inc are you referring it in the first quarter at the end of last year jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc yes what was it in the first quarter james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc the reinvestment yield walter walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc the reinvestment yield in the quarter was i believe in the first quarter as i indicated were tracking in sorry i didnt get the question at first jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc okay and then when you look at client allocations of the certificates just as interest rates go up its around of the mix now i think when we look back at in it reached a similar level but just with interest rates higher and for longer in this cycle do you have any sense on where that could go or whats your expectation there walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes so listen you are seeing it certainly increase from that standpoint because it basically gives the clients as you get into the three and six primarily in the three and six months it gives them that opportunity to basically meet their objective set so we see still increasing there but as jim mentioned we are certainly be offering the brokered product in the bank which will certainly provide us additional yield so i would think it will still grow and from that standpoint as so i think its tracking what you see based on the alternatives that we provide to our clients james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah its going to grow because were bringing in more client assets right and not all of its going to be deployed directly in the market so theres going to be some that go into cash type of holdings so some of it that the clients will use for transactional activity and holding for emergency expenses will be kept in the type sweep accounts and others that positional cash will be put into things earning some of the yield that theyre looking for and a lot of these cds are not necessarily longterm cds or broker cds as well so thats where the cash will grow and some of it has been coming from the regional bank activity i would imagine so i feel like the certificate program can grow thats why were also going to offer our own brokered cd to garner some of that cash that clients want to move into the firm walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 and weve clearly seen a pattern from basically what we call the cash reserve which is the short term and more cash basically going into the three and six months so people are taking advantage of that opportunity because of the competitiveness of the rates and notes simply jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc okay thank you operator thank you well go next now to suneet kamath at jefferies suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks just a couple more on cash so you had mentioned that billion number of which i think you have billion so as we think about the billion balance i guess what would you think is a realistic expectation in terms of how much of that you could bring on to your platform and over what time period james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well suneet i think the way i would think about it is that thats roughly around of the total assets now which is a bit higher for our clients right usually its around the mark or something like that so theres more cash being held right now so i think as we go through this cycle and people are looking for some alternatives coming from their banking institutions et cetera we think that we can garner some of that other cash coming in as well from bank or even as some of these cds and other things roll over that were holding can go into our own banking institution but i also think over time that some of that cash will be deployed back into wrap type programs et cetera as the market volatility settles or as people feel more comfortable so its not as the money isnt being deployed into the market it is right we had over billion going back into wrap in every quarter but that could pick up as well and other transactions can pick up so its hard for me to say exactly but the idea is were helping to bring more client flows in and then some of that goes into cash type products which we can garner ph rps and then others will over time be deployed back in the market so we think its an opportunity for us suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc yeah understood and then i guess if we think about just the cash sweep balance i dont know if you commented on this but it was down i guess billion quarteroverquarter to around billion can you give us some help in terms of how you see that billion trending maybe over the next couple of quarters and i guess of that billion decline i think some of it went into the bank some of it went into certs but i can you give us some help in terms of where sort of the rest of it went because im having a little bit of trouble seeing exactly where that cash went walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so obviously as jim mentioned the cash is up in total and so yes youre exactly right we pulled into the bank and certainly a portion of that went into the certs so the issue is some of that went into brokerage but the point is we have it its been within our basic overall its cycling through so i would say and we feel and im ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 indicating again it is clearly as we see the pattern that sorting is basically slowing and it is basically within a range and the base of the fact that we have in the below and the average account balances dropped from to is an important factor for us as we evaluate suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc got it james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc suneet so you had i think billion gone to billion part of that billion from the billion went into the bank and then you had i dont know a few billion went into certs but you also had some use of cash for tax payments and others okay its hard for us but we have more client flow coming in and then some of it might have went into brokered cds or other things so overall i think weve held pretty well compared to what weve seen in the industry and we had positive of more client flow coming in as well so and as i said i think we cant necessarily box a number ideally but its a fluid situation regarding how clients use their money as well so but its pretty stable overall so its about in total sweep and the billion is mainly from a shift for the bank and other things so i wouldnt look at that in isolation suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc makes sense and maybe just one last one on comerica as we think about that opportunity should we walter be expecting any incremental costs associated with that platform as we kind of move through the year walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i think again this has a short payback for us as you look it from a pl standpoint so the answer is obviously therell be some cost but certainly the revenue will do it and we have a very quick payback on it but its a good economic relationship for us and for comerica james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i mean you got onboarding expense and stuff and moving the clients and the advisers and stuff but overall we think its a good arrangement and one that will work for both parties suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you operator thank you well go next now to steven chubak at wolfe research michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 hey good morning its michael anagnostakis on for steven i wanted to touch on i know you guys gave the cash per account metric of for the quarter certainly a helpful metric to have where are we for that metric relative to the trough you had seen last cycle just trying to gauge the potential downside relative to cash as a percentage of aum thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i really cant give but i would say its always been a stability factor for us that portion and the working capital and the balance there so i cant give you exact i just as i said it just dropped from if you look at the previous quarter its dropped by so it is from that standpoint we feel very good about it its been a stable element within it and it did increase a lot certainly as we went through the cycle coming through and that was again in the harder balances so i just cant give you the numbers going back that far michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc got it no worries okay so i did want to touch on asset management too expense is very well controlled you reached that low end of the target range i guess assuming stable markets is the sustainable run rate given the efficiency efforts youre continuing to look to deliver on or is there some downside to that just any color there would be helpful thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i think theres downside obviously its a lot of variability in it as you look at rates and look at mix and you look at inputs but certainly the expenses are being extremely well managed from that standpoint so thats the controllable factor in it as we look at it and certainly as we look at hopefully that we stop getting back on a better pattern but were certainly aligned with the industry where that is and we certainly moving into that to is basically you feel comfortable but its again a lot of variability michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc thanks so much operator thank you well go next now to tom gallagher of evercore thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi good morning walter just a followup on the customer cash balances i think one of the earlier questions had asked you whether or not you would expect the earnings contribution from customer cash balances to be stable let me ask it in a different way what do you expect the earnings contribution to be for the next couple of quarters will do you expect it to be stable or up higher just some kind of range walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so i cant give you an exact range but let me be clear the drivers of it are clearly as we indicated the maturity element as it relates to the bank and shifting in there so as we get maturities on those being risk thats going to take the interest rate up we certainly see the slowing really slowing down on the the bank transfer will ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 certainly take that up again as we get more comfortable the certs looking at the timing from the standpoint where the rate is increasing we do see an opportunity that the net spread will increase there so i would say certainly it will get stable to up as we look at the elements but please now you have rate movements in there you have different elements but its that stability factor of what is embedded today so if everything got frozen yes you should feel stable to up thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi got it stable to up thats what i was looking for thanks now in terms of the new money yields ive definitely been getting questions on that like what are you buying exactly is it still rmbs is it floating rate walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc we have a combination of floating rate but it is really structured and thats where we basically are and its the highest quality so we are being very selective there but the yields are there and we just we are patient and thats but like i said its in the bank especially its aaa and we feel very comfortable especially in this environment sticking there but those are the levels we are finding were certainly having the benefit of having cti manage that and help us work through that so it is strictly you should look at majorities in the structure thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi and the crediting rate on that well call it billion of net deposits into the bank was that consistent with the cash sweep like basis points or what would the incremental crediting rate wouldve been walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc basically a part of awm and that is its cost of funds and thats why we feel comfortable with that and certainly as rate if rates go up and down we will evaluate the deposit betas but yeah that is youre exactly spot on thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi so the incremental spread is over basis points right now on the assets youre shifting in walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc as the source yes because the source of those deposits is the spread is coming out of the sweep thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi thanks and then just one final one on comerica i heard what you said to suneet but the is that going to just be a revenue share or is there some upfront cash payment that will be made to them thats going to use up excess capital at the end of the year how is that going to work walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 no i do not believe again this is like any deal like this you basically upfront and you then get the paybacks that will work through it and we feel very comfortable with the combination so it will as i said make certainly from a pl standpoint a contribution then we look at the cash breakeven so we feel very good of it as jim said well have some upfront expenses but its a good economic deal for both of us thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi great thanks operator thank you well go next now to john barnidge of piper sandler john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co good morning thank you very much for the opportunity my question is on the asset management segment can you talk about fee rates on the flows leaving versus coming in and then institutional tends to have a longer sales cycle so any visibility into the pipeline there would be helpful thank you james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so if we have retail outflows theyre always of a bit higher margin than the fee rate than the institutional side the good thing on the institutional some of the flows we got in were real estate which is very good fee rates and that looks like we have a decent pipeline as well going forward but of course and retail is youre a bit higher fee rate so thats where on the outflows were probably are netnet a bit negative there and so but hopefully the retail will turn around we look like europe has actually slowed it was almost neutral in the quarter which is good and if that picks up that has positive fee rates even more than the us so that would be positive for us there but the us is still a bit weaker on the growth side but the redemptions has come down so hopefully well see a turnaround and so i think that we see more stabilization occurring and hopefully that will pick up as we go through the year john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co great thank you and then my followup question you were talking about additional synergies in asset management with integration to be completed by end of those additional synergies i know sometimes in europe a notice period may be longer are you talking about those synergies being announced or absolutely flowing through earnings by the end of the year thank you walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so we should garner about as it relates to not realized but certainly garner around of it in that range in this year so its tracking and youre right its certainly whats going on but we feel comfortable were on track did that answer your question john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 thank you i was talking about the additional synergies youre talking walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah john im talking about bmo synergies right now if youre talking about that james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so were tracking were getting some of them this year and then more of them as we close out the year into next year because were going through a lot more of the technology integration now and then from that we can then continue to do the middle and back office and so and to your point it does take a bit longer in europe and the uk as we go through different legal entities et cetera so but were on target to what we originally said walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so basically as we talked about were talking about in the range we will have not ph million we think will probably be the number that we will certainly not realize but certainly achieve by the end of this year john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you very much operator thank you well go next now to andrew kligerman of credit suisse andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc good morning so a couple of quick followups on comerica so with the billion in assets that you bring in how should we think once you get finished with the onboarding how should we think about margins on that billion relative to the billionplus of your other nonwrap assets will it be materially better will it be in line how should we think about that walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i would say from looking at our direct contribution margin there is certainly within our range and we feel very comfortable with it like i said i distinguished the pl and the cash certainly from that standpoint but the pl side of this direct contribution is totally acceptable within as we look at this channel and its strong its good and like i said but its good because its balanced between for them and for us and certainly what will add and the ability to grow that activity so its the contribution margins will not be denigrating to anything we have else that andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it perfect and then with respect to the advisers you brought in could you give us a sense of maybe the aum per adviser relative to the aum per adviser that you have now and maybe a little color on their sweet spot are they in that to million net worth what end of the spectrum do they come in at ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i would say we are continuing to have that track pattern of really the quality of the aum and the gdc the trailing gdc is stronger and we keep on growing that so we feel very good about that were being very selective to ensure that they fit into basically our relationship and approach that we have and so its very much aligned on that so its we feel very good about the quality of them andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc so walter is the net assets per adviser are a little better than your average walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i would say it continues to be better than our average yeah andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it and then lastly just on the capital management it looks like your payout ratio as a percent of operating earnings is coming in around 80ish percent maybe a little less historically you were at or maybe even better and i guess with the bank having grown a lot should we expect something in that sort of payout range going forward anything likely to change there walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so as we said we talked about we have from our standpoint we are building organically and yes there is capital we have the capacity and we feel that the weve given an indication that it will be in that range but we really had the ability to as we look at opportunistically to basically take it up but we will evaluate the market and everything from that standpoint but the is a reasonable number at this stage as weve indicated and most people have built that into their projection set andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc yeah we have thanks a lot operator thank you and we have no further questions at this time ladies and gentlemen this will conclude todays conference thank you for participating you may now disconnect ameriprise financial
