still dont have a formal plan to manage assets income and expenses and retirement as we highlighted previously our advisers continue to hold a higher level of cash for their clients with the highest shortterm yields theyre able to attain and the market uncertainty therefore we continue to see a lower percentage of our assets moving into wrap with billion in the quarter as markets settle we expect

management were million up it remains a challenging time both in asset management and the active space in particular our flows were largely consistent with the industry in retail as we know people are still hesitant to put money to work so gross sales were a bit weaker however redemptions have improved and our overall flow rates in the us are in line with active managers for the product disciplines we compete in and in europe our flows have improved a bit from a year ago institutional mandates can be lumpy but ph we were in net flows excluding legacy insurance partners were earning mandates in a number of areas though ldi flows in total were down compared to a robust quarter a year ago in regard to our investment performance we have strong short and longterm performance across equities fixed income and asset allocation with a nice pickup in the shortterm fixed income and now about of our asset weighted funds were above the median for three and fiveyear periods and more than for the 10year

management system with that we have now completed all of the large integration activities we are now focused on adjusting our global operating model and expenses so we can continue to generate good margins in a tough climate for asset management adjusted operating margin was and above our targeted range ga was down adjusted for foreign exchange we also have taken action to tightly manage

market cycle assets under management and administration ended the quarter at trillion up auma benefited from strong client flows and market appreciation across the firm we continue to manage expenses tightly relative to the revenue opportunity within each segment while we continue to make investments in the bank and other growth initiatives particularly in wealth management we are taking a disciplined approach on discretionary expenses to manage margins across our businesses given the uncertainty in the macro environment ga expenses were well managed in the quarter up excluding the regulatory accrual general and administrative expense grew from higher business volumes and growth investments our ga expenses remain on track with our expectations for the year our consolidated margin reached a record high of excluding unlocking and regulatory accruals balance sheet fundamentals remain strong our portfolio is well positioned and we have strong capital and liquidity positions this allowed us to return million of capital to shareholders a strong return of of our operating earnings excluding unlocking and a continuation of our differentiated track record turning to slide

operating earnings increased from last year with meaningful benefits from strong client flows higher interest earnings and wellmanaged expenses lets turn to individual segment performance beginning

corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 weve had billion of net inflows over the past year with billion coming in this quarter from new clients joining the firm the deepening of existing relationships and adding experienced advisors clients remain defensively positioned with a lower level of flows into wrap than we have seen historically our flexible model and broad offerings allow advisors and clients to pivot as markets and client preferences shift while the money stays within the system revenue per advisor reached in the quarter up from the prior year from a higher spread revenue enhanced productivity and business growth turning to slide id like to provide an update on client cash levels our total cash balances reached a new high this quarter at billion as we continue to see new money flowing into money market funds and brokered cds as well as into certificates this creates a significant redeployment opportunity as markets normalize for clients to put money back to work in wrap and other products on our platform cash sweep is largely working cash for our client accounts while there is some seasonality with cash levels cash remains an important component of the clients asset allocation cash sweep and certificate balance ended the third quarter at billion down billion from a year ago and down billion sequentially since the end of august cash levels have been essentially flat our sweep cash has an average size of per account and of the aggregate cash is now in accounts under and we have seen very limited movement out of these accounts the financial benefit from cash remains strong this will be an important and sustainable source of earnings going forward we continue to manage our investment portfolios prudently our bank portfolio is aaa rated with a 36year duration the overall yield on the investments in the portfolio is and rising with new money yield on investments in the second quarter of our certificate portfolio is highly liquid with over half of the portfolio in cash governments and agencies it is aa rated on average with a oneyear duration in total the certificate company portfolio is now yielding with new purchases in the quarter at

expect awm full year ga growth to be in the midsingledigit range we remain on track to close the comerica investment program partnership in november which will bring approximately advisors and billion of client assets lets turn to asset management on slide financial results were very strong in the quarter and we are managing the business well through a challenging environment that is impacting the industry total aum increased to billion primarily from higher equity markets and foreign exchange translation partially offset by net outflows asset management like other active managers was an outflows in the quarter ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 like others we experienced pressure from global market volatility and a riskoff investor sentiment investment performance has been another critical area of focus and we are seeing improvement including in fixed income strategies overall longterm performance remains very strong and we had improvement in oneyear fixed income numbers on slide in the quarter asset management earnings increased to million as a result of equity market appreciation disciplined expense management higher performance fees and million of favorable timing related items which more than offset the cumulative impact of net outflows the margin was in the quarter importantly we continue to manage the areas we can control expenses remain well managed total expenses declined with ga decreasing million however excluding the impact from foreign exchange translation ga was down reflecting early benefits from expense management initiatives as jim said given the environment we are taking a very focused look across the business globally to further reduce expense lets turn to slide retirement protection solutions contained to deliver good earnings and free cash flow generation reflecting the high quality of the business in the quarter pretax adjusted operating earnings excluding unlocking were million up from the prior year primarily as a result of the higher investment yields from the portfolio repositioning we executed last year we continue to view normalized annual earnings of million as a reasonable expectation for this business we completed our annual actuarial assumption update in the quarter resulting in an unfavorable pretax impact of million primarily related to updates to persistency assumptions for variable annuities overall retirement protection solutions improved in the quarter with protection sales of to million primarily in highermargin vul products variable annuity sales grew to billion with the majority of the sales in structured variable annuities our longterm care business continues to perform very well the business is gradually running off as clients

expectations you can see additional detail of this block in the appendix of this presentation now lets move to the balance sheet on slide our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong and our diversified highquality investment portfolio remains well positioned in total the average credit rating of the portfolio is aa with less than of the portfolio in below investmentgrade securities va hedge effectiveness remained very strong at our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable free cash flow contributions across all business segments this supports the consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders during the quarter we returned million to shareholders and still ended the quarter with billion of excess capital and billion of holding company available liquidity with that well take your questions ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so wanted to start with a twopart question on organic growth within wealth you had another solid quarter of flows but the pace did moderate slightly for you and frankly some of your wealth peers as well just given the challenging operating backdrop i was hoping first that you could speak to your confidence level in sustaining that midsingledigit flow rate and then second with the onboarding of comerica any color you can share on the growth outlook or backlog for new mandates within the bank channel james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc okay ill start when we look at the flow rate from a client perspective we still feel very good about the ability to bring in client flows and were approaching the market particularly as we move a bit more upmarket as you would imagine i mean there are some blips and not blips depending on where you are in the season i think for the summer time things slowed a bit but we dont see that as sort of a trend line down we see it as more of a sustainable based on what were doing how advisors are engaged and how theyre attracting clients and activity in the marketplace so we still feel very good about our ability to continue on the client flow rate as far as the you want to mention comerica walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes obviously were on target for closure with them in the beginning of november and yes we do have a very active pipeline at this stage so yes we feel that theres opportunity steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great and just for my followup on the asset management margins as you noted the business is facing secular headwinds and given some of the pressures i was pleasantly surprised by the margin strength the resiliency that we saw in the quarter i was hoping you could just speak to your margin outlook if flow headwinds persist and whether theres additional expense flexibility to defend those margins and stay within your targeted range of to james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so as you saw first on the fee level its been very stable which is very positive again youre going to always have some adjustments based upon where the assets and the type of assets institutional retail but from an outlook perspective were just beginning our expense tightening there you saw a reduction in expense around on fx adjusted ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 but we feel theres a good opportunity for us as we look at our global operating environment now that weve fully integrated the bmo acquisition on to our global platforms and now were looking at how we tighten those processes how we improve the efficiency the operating effectiveness and where resources are located etcetera so were taking a very hard look at that and were at the beginning stages of that not the end steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc really helpful color thanks so much for taking my questions operator the next question is from alex blostein with goldman sachs your line is open alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey guys good morning thanks for the questions so first maybe around cash in advice wealth management it sounds like the trends in sorting continue to stabilize over the course of the quarter so maybe just a quick update on where the balances stand relative to the billion that you reported at the end of september and i guess more importantly as you think about the mix i think you have about billion of balance sheet sweep deposits does that leave you much room to move more into the bank or the growth of the bank from this point on really should just be a function of reinvestment of securities and picking up some of that incremental yield that you spoke to earlier walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc okay i think the question is we ended the quarter at billion on sweep and as of october its billion and so it is totally stabilized from that standpoint yes we do have certainly a buffer to move into bank we are just being very measured and cautious at this stage as were evaluating the environment but we do have certainly a buffer to move additional indiscernible alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great and zooming out a little bit on given your comments around expenses and youre early in stages of maybe doing more on the asset management side but also managing ga tightly across the firm any early thoughts on ga growth firm wide relative to what youre likely to do in james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so alex were definitely in that review now what i would say is to start the ga would be flat at best meaning in a sense that is not going up alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and thats over correct ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay thank you james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and remember you got other things that occur but were going to absorb all of that and were looking for it not to be higher than ph being required alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it appreciate it thanks operator the next question is from craig siegenthaler with bank of america your line is open craig siegenthaler q analyst bofa securities inc thanks good morning everyone thanks for taking the question so i was looking for an update on the recruiting front financial advisor head count was down in the quarter franchise retention was lower and the new recruit count was also below the prior run rate so i was just wondering if you can give us an update for your expectation both recruiting and fa head count growth over the next months james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes so as we mentioned recruiting was a bit slower in the third quarter but it started to bounce back towards the latter part of the quarter july started a bit slower i think vacations and other things as you probably saw around the country but we saw that bounce back in september the pipeline is quite strong we think well get back to our consistent rate and then you mentioned a little bit of an uptick in attrition the attrition really in that channel was mainly due to assistant financial advisors which is again the turnover there is a bit higher all the franchisees their retention rate is still at alltime highs and that book of business stays so its more of some assistance in their practices as they make some changes so we dont see any change in where we were craig siegenthaler q analyst bofa securities inc thanks jim and then on the client cash balances i was wondering if you could just share what the roes look like on the certificates business compared to your core cash balances and products and just update us on what are your plans to grow this base further i think you have to hold about capital against the asset base and also i think theres probably some value in extending cds to third parties it helps expand your brand etcetera ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc let me take the first part of the question on certificates yes certificates as a regulatory item has a capital element associated with that but when we evaluate it we obviously assess it so thats the regulatory portion of it and so we feel very comfortable with that and the growth potential there we have adequate capital and cash to support that so that is the range in which we operate on and then certainly its been growing and weve been supporting it the second part james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc the second part you mentioned is the opportunity to bring in more external cash if i understood that correctly and yes were very much focused as i said we initially put a savings product were looking at more of a preferred type of thing to bring more cash in from clients outside banking activities were going to be putting in place a full checking account and then some various lending products as well so we will look to establish a more fullfledged banking activity with the ability to attract more assets externally into the bank that would also help bring more assets on board in total for the client activities for the advisors walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc the only thing i would add to that is that obviously we have more ph than enough capital to support that sort of growth that jim was just referring to craig siegenthaler q analyst bofa securities inc thank you operator the next question is from suneet kamath with jefferies your line is open suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning i wanted to go to that slide that talked about the billion of thirdparty cash i guess that piece has grown substantially and i guess the question is what do you think needs to happen in order for that to get deployed because it sounds like youre thinking some of it may go into wrap but then youre offering these newer bank products that might move some of that thirdparty cash to our own products so maybe just give us a sense of how you think that will develop as we move forward here thanks james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes so suneet i think thats really the larger question right and that depends on how people feel about the market and where rates are going forward right so i think if you saw the market over the last number of quarters it increased tremendously with a lot of volatility and people were concerned right a few stocks drove that up now you see a pullback occurring right ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 so i think if the market starts to feel like its on a better more solid footing i think people will start to deploy back i also think that as rates if they stabilize on the longterm up where they are rather than continue to rise youll see money move from the short to the longterm to lock it in right and get that appreciation and the spread so i dont have a crystal ball but i think were holding extra cash for the reason that we feel a little bit regarding the environment and where the markets are but that will go back people dont hold that amount of cash at that percentage that were seeing right now and i think thats across the industry not just in our channel but its good it stays with us right now and when its ready to deploy our advisors will definitely do it theyre investing for the longterm not just to take advantage of the market in the shortterm suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc and can you just provide some timing on when youre planning on rolling out some of those other banking products that you mentioned in response to an earlier question james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes were looking to do that over the course of the new year so were looking to phase that in and right now were just looking at the climate and looking at the operating activities for that so we feel good about getting things up and running in the bank in more of a fullfledged fashion so it will be periodic well alert you to it as we go about suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc makes sense and then maybe just if i could sneak one more in on expenses for walter so i think you said flat in relative to when you think about the segment level should we assume a little bit of a decline in asset management offset by some growth in advice wealth management just in terms of the moving pieces there walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes i think thats a reasonable assumption obviously we are focusing on cti and looking at to preserve margin and certainly continue to take advantage of the growth opportunities in awm but still prudently managing the expenses james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes and suneet i mean across the firm were going to look for that to be managed pretty tightly okay so i mean i dont have firm number at this point in time but as i said i feel good to start with about ga flat suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thank you operator the next question is from tom gallagher with evercore your line is open ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi morning first question just a followup on the billion of thirdparty client cash do you currently earn any fee on that money at all from an administration perspective or would that all be revenue upside if that gets deployed into your wrap account walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc its marginal i would say its bigger around four or five basis points but its the real opportunity of redeployment that will provide us certainly the margin and profitability potential thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi got you lets see the other question i had was on variable annuity reserve charge i know when some other companies have taken reserve strengthening under the new accounting that theres been an ongoing earnings drag in addition to the reserve charge anything like that to consider for the variable annuity charge walter i think i heard you say the million a quarter was still intact on guide so i presume that means probably not much but just curious if theres any impact there walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc youre correct its probably not much and the answer is no really thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thanks and then should there be a similar charge on a statutory basis for the same assumption changes or is that still tbd walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i think its still tbd thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi and then if i could sneak in a final one long term care i saw your updated disclosures which i thought was helpful i guess considering that this block continues to shrink it looks like the risk is well managed is risk transfer still a consideration here or is the bidask spread still too wide or should we really think about you most likely continuing to own it considering the risk continues to shrink james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so over the years we certainly have been able to demonstrate that we are managing the risk very effectively so any risk transfer would have to consider that and really have a very balanced bidask because the portfolio is performing quite well and its indicated in the observations that you made about it so yes we feel very ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 comfortable in retaining it but if somebody comes along with something that is certainly in the best interest of the shareholder well consider it walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc over the last number of years its performed better than we expected in many instances and improved in that sense and we havent factored in some of the other things that has affected through covid as a positive yet thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi thanks operator the next question is from brennan hawken with ubs your line is open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions thanks for all the color on the cash dynamics here intraquarter and quartertodate and certainly sounds encouraging i guess does that mean that we could get back to a period where we are looking at how to grow the sweep balances and it just becomes a function of net new assets or is that sort of more organic growth trajectory still hindered by balance remixing and when do you think we could get to that period thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so obviously as you can see it truly has stabilized and yes as we bring new years in and that certainly is growth and certainly as we have organic growth that is an opportunity right now i cant predict environments and things like that but we feel very good because of the stability of the sweep account as we said a substantial portion of thats close to is in account balances that are under the average ph account being i think so its very stable its working capital and working cash thats deployed so yes certainly as we grow we anticipate that growing but again theres a lot of variables here james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes and again i think if you start to see a change in the rate environment the markets stabilize theres money being held out in like brokered cds and stuff that when they mature could possibly come back in and when money is more active in investing then they keep more in the sweep and the balances to deploy so theres a number of different variables we cant really predict that but our cash rate thats holding in sweep is pretty low so if anything we think that if activity picks up that could increase again brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it and so do you think that now that weve had stability in the sweep likewise we can think about maybe theres a little bit of a lag or whatnot but theres some stability in nii when we sum up both the on balance sheet ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 and off balance sheet which has been a quarterly kind of slide and a little bit here yeartodate are we at a period where maybe thats going to begin to flat line and return to the algorithm of growing with cash balances rates all else equal of course walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes we do there is opportunity there and we do see that we have opportunity to grow nii brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc outstanding thank you walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc for the reasons that you mentioned and certainly as we have the maturities coming in ph because of the short duration and other elements coming up and those factors we certainly feel comfortable saying yes on that point brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks very much operator the next question is from ryan krueger with kbw your line is open ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning first question was can you give a sense of how much bank assets will mature next year to reinvest that potentially higher rate james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc youre saying on buyback ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no maturing bank assets that would be reinvested walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i believe its again its in the area of about billion i believe but well confirm that with you ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks and then i guess i had one more question on the billion of thirdparty cash do you view the opportunity primarily as clients move more money back into the market to capture some of that through wrap or ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2023 do you think theres some opportunity to capture some of the billion with the bank products that youre rolling now james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well i would probably say the first and foremost would be as i said with the market i would think that more would go back to work in solutions like wrap that would have a balance of equities and fixed incomes and ph alternative stuff along those lines i also feel like as we do roll out some of these other products that yes it will garner some internal cash as well rather than moving it out into other vehicles like a brokered cd and just based on a combination of the environment and the security of ameriprise so we do feel comfortable about that as well but i would probably say the larger opportunity would be moving back into solutions like wrap business ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood thank you operator we have no further
