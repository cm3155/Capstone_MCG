on the call today will focus on operating financial results excluding unlocking and with that ill turn it over to jim james michael cracchiolo chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc good morning and thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call clearly the operating environment in the quarter had ongoing challenges with both elevated market volatility and the impact of extremely low interest rates while there has been good growth in equity markets volatility has returned given the election and the unknowns related to the virus overall i feel very good about how ameriprise is performing against this backdrop client activity and organic flows are strong which is a real positive as we operate through this pandemic we continue to invest strategically to further enhance our position in addition our capital strength continues to be a clear differentiator our results are good considering the environment extremely low interest rates pressured our results which is why revenues were down with adjusted operating earnings per diluted share down excluding unlocking and the sale of the auto and home business due to the significant move in shortterm rates revenues and earnings were reduced by million yearoveryear this precipitous drop in rates muted the underlying revenue growth in earnings which would have been up with eps up weve offset some of the interest pressure with good expense management in fact ga expenses were down yearoveryear and we will continue our disciplined efforts here we continue to have good margins and generate substantial free cash flow while we invest in the business and return to shareholders our return on equity remains well above many peers at exunlocking in terms of assets under management and administration we ended the quarter with a record of nearly trillion dollars lets begin with advice wealth management client activity and flows are good the ameriprise differentiated advice value proposition works well both in this environment and for the long term total client assets increase nicely up to billion with strong client inflows including billion in wrap flows which is a improvement over last year meanwhile transactional activity picked up from the lows of last quarter and although its below last year it is returning to more normal levels as conditions improve client brokerage cash balances are very high up yearoveryear and as opportunities arise over the next few quarters we expect clients to put even more of their money back to work being digitally enabled with extensive web and mobile capabilities has been core to the excellent client engagement and the client satisfaction were driving were working with clients really well in this environment and were getting very positive feedback our advisors are helping their clients stay focused on their longterm goals which they can track online were also receiving great feedback from advisors about our integrated ecosystem of ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 capabilities which is helping them operate their practices remotely process business efficiently and serve their clients well this high level of support gives us the ability to help advisors be more productive the advisor productivity was up in the quarter even with the slowest summer months in this pandemic and the low interest rates the significant drop in short rates also muted the underlying growth in productivity which would have been up nicely at turning to recruiting we welcome highly productive experienced advisors to the firm in the third quarter activity continue to pick up over the summer as our virtual recruiting program helped us connect with even more top advisors across the industry including from wirehouses independents and rias the fact that we had such good success in getting advisors to move during this period points to the strength of our value proposition were using our capabilities to engage more advisors and onboard them quickly in this environment the pipeline continues to look good in regard to our banking activities we had more than billion of sweep deposits and billion of total assets at the bank already and we expect to continue to move additional sweep deposits next year we also launched our mortgage program nationally and we will be adding pledge loans in the fourth quarter our lending capabilities are a great complement to our advice value proposition and the bank allows us to help clients with both sides of their balance sheet the awm margin which was strong at and thats with the full weight of interest rates in fact the margin is up basis points from the second quarter and as i mentioned earlier expenses are wellmanaged with ga up only keep in mind that that includes investments in the bank as well as increased volumerelated expenses from business growth so as we grow from here we feel good about our ability to continue to drive margin improvement now id like to move to retirement protection solutions as we discussed with you we continue to reposition the business to reflect the interest rate environment and our conservative risk appetite we are managing our books in a very intentional way in terms of product changes sales priorities and product exits as part of this strategy we moved our closed blocks of fixed and fixed indexed annuities to the corporate segment and we continue to reassess reinsuring our close fixed annuity inforce blocks additionally we are proactively shifting our variable annuity and mix away from products with living benefits in fact our new structured product in variable annuities without living benefits represent of total va sales in the quarter more than double where it was last year and this complements the wide range of competitive products from other firms that we offer in our channel in protection were taken similar steps with a focus on growing our highermargin vul and disability products in fact we saw a strong pickup in vul sales of yearoveryear we reduced our focus on iul as it is less attractive in this interest rate environment you can expect that we will continue to manage the business in this manner and this will help accelerate the shift in our business mix to wealth and asset management now ill turn to asset management where the improvements weve been making are translating into good results assets under management at columbia threadneedle were up yearoveryear to nearly billion in terms of financials earnings were also strong up with good revenue growth and excellent ongoing expense management in fact margin came in at nearly well above our target range ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 our investment performance has been excellent during this period of intense volatility this is a great credit to our global investment operation and outstanding research in equities on a global basis more than of our funds on an assetweighted basis were above medium or beating benchmarks for one three and five year periods and within that i also like to highlight that nearly of our funds were in the top quartile while this performance is broadbased importantly it is particularly good across strategies we are focused on in terms of client demand in fixed income globally our teams are delivering good performance our taxable performance is very strong at about of our funds above medium or beating benchmarks over one three and five year periods and in tax exempt fixed income our three and five year performance globally is strong with some weakness in the one year id like to turn to flows now starting with global retail where we had another good quarter retail inflows were billion not including million of inflows from former parentrelated retail assets this was a significant improvement yearoveryear in the us net inflows exformer parent were billion as we continue to deliver very good results across distribution channels particularly at large broker dealer firms and independents were in net inflows at seven out of eight of our top firms and were now delivering positive flows in each of the past two quarters yeartodate net flows were billion and on emea we returned to net inflows of million after a long period of headwinds due to brexit and economic weakness in the region in terms of institutional we continue to gain traction globally winning good higher fee mandates in all three regions we did have two low fee redemptions in the quarter that total billion one was an insurance client that sold the business and redeemed which we fully expected from the transaction the other was from a client who was in a quant strategy for well over a decade and a half and redeemed largely due to an asset allocation decision adjusted for these two moves and former parent related outflows we had billion of net inflows in the quarter the institutional mandates were winning are attractive higherfee businesses that more than offset the lost revenue from these lower fee outflows overall in institutional weve strengthened the core of the business in terms of consultant relations and client service and we continue to build our pipeline well also soon complete the final phase of the installation of our technology platform for trading and portfolio management globally this will help reduce our use of duplicate legacy systems drive additional efficiency and improve scale to sum up asset management we have excellent investment performance and were making real progress in our distribution activities and intend to keep that focus so for ameriprise overall when i look at the business we have strong value propositions terrific distribution and clear focus on execution were serving our clients well while generate significant free cash flow and shareholder value and from a capital perspective were able to deliver a differentiated level of return when most of our peers have pulled back all while maintaining excellent balance sheet fundamentals we returned million to shareholders in the quarter and are on track to return close to of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders for the year and you saw the board approved a new billion authorization through in closing id like to take a moment to highlight that earlier this month we reached our 15th year anniversary as an independent public company im proud of what we accomplished the respected brand we built and how we cared ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 for our clients advisors and employees weve been able to deal with very challenging environments during these years to emerge even stronger just as were doing today as we moved into the fourth quarter i continue to feel good about how were operating now walter will cover the quarter in more detail and ill take your questions walter stanley berman chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc thank you jim ameriprise has delivered very strong financial and metric performance in light of the interest rate environment both on a consolidated basis and across the business segments both revenue and eps were down slightly yearoveryear on a reported basis as the interest rate headwinds of million or per diluted share muted results normalizing for that ameriprise delivered revenue growth of and billion and adjusting operating eps growth of to these favorable trends are evident across our business segments underlying advice wealth management earnings were up asset management earnings and retirement protection solutions were both up i will get into the details on subsequent pages turning to slide in awm total client assets grew to billion and wrap assets were up reflecting continued strong wrap net inflows wrap flows increased billion advisor productivity continues to trend upward reaching per advisor on a trailing month basis reported yearoveryear growth was but the growth rate increased excluding the impact of interest rates strong experienced advisor recruiting new digital tools and capabilities and serving more of our target client market are the key drivers of this trend lastly cash and certificate balances remain elevated at nearly billion we earn basis points on our off balance sheet brokerage accounts reflecting the low fed funds rate our investment yield at the bank was over basis points demonstrating the yield opportunity from bring balances on to our balance sheet as you can see on page financial results were clearly impacted by headwinds from rates advice wealth management adjusted operating net revenue and earnings both absorbed million from the precipitous decline in shortterm interest rates for comparative purposes revenue was up pti was up and the margin was up basis points after normalizing for interest rates this was driven by strong wrap net inflows productivity gains bank growth and market appreciation as well as effective expense management ga expenses increased in line with expectations as we continue to invest for future growth where appropriate including the bank we will continue to prudently manage our expense base and adjust accordingly based upon the environment turning to page asset management delivered very good financial performance and continued improvement in flow trends in the quarter we had continued inflows and higher fee retail assets and institutional flows were positive excluding significant outflows into low fee mandates and former parent assets we will continue to leverage global operational capabilities and provide diverse practical offerings with strong investment performance overall we are encouraged by the continued progress the businesses is making adjusted operating revenues were million flat compared to a yearago quarter which included million in performance fees adjusting for the timing of the performance fees revenues increased reflecting improved flow trends market appreciation and an increase in the management fee rate to over basis points ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 adjusted operating expenses remain well managed general and administrative expenses remain well managed reflecting disciplined expense management with reengineering initiatives funding target investments for growth pretax earnings were million up results include million of performance fee timing in the year ago period and approximately a net favorable million of impact from onetime items in the current period this strong performance was driven by improved net flows market appreciation and expense discipline pretax adjusted margin was quite strong at reflecting the positive revenue and expense trends turning to page you will see our new retirement protection solutions segment as we continue to implement strategy to target our focus the businesses are a smaller portion of our earnings so we combined the lines into one segment we are taking a more focused strategy for this business as demonstrated by changes to our product features which focus on lower risk and higher margin products while continuing to seek reinsurance opportunities additionally we discontinued the sale of fixed annuities and fixed indexed annuities in the second quarter as a result we moved the fixed annuities business into the corporate segment as the closed block just as we did with longterm care a few years ago we have seen a nice mix in sales to retirement products without living benefits in the quarter of our sales were in products without living benefits up from a year ago this improvement reflects traction in our new structured variable annuity product we launched earlier this year in protection sales of higher margin vul were up while indexed universal life our product with lower margin in this interest rate environment declined we are continuing to assess and adjust product features to reflect the current interest rate environment financial results continue to perform in line with expectations pretax adjusted operating earnings increased million excluding unlocking impacts that were previously announced this is primarily as a result of lower surrenders and withdrawals that reduce the amortization of deferred acquisition costs as well as lower sales and higher ending market levels claims are performed within expectations and we are not seeing material impacts from covid on our protection business in addition our closed block of longterm care earned million excluding unlocking which reflects favorable claims experience as weve preannounced our unlocking impact in the quarter was approximately million after tax across retirement protection solutions longterm care and fixed annuities primarily as a result of changes to our interest rate assumptions importantly the changes made this quarter were on a gaap basis and changes in both the interest rate and grading period do not impact excess capital which is calculated on a statutory basis in the fourth quarter we completed our statutory analysis reserve called asset adequacy testing we proactively completed an offcycle asset adequacy test in the third quarter in conjunction with our unlocking analysis we determined from that analysis that there is no material impact on reserves on a statutory basis now lets move to the balance sheet on the last slide our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong including our liquidity position of billion at the parent company substantial excess capital billion effective hedging at and a defensively positioned investment portfolio our adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at we returned million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback we are on track to return of earnings to shareholders in ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 with that we will take your questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from andrew kligerman from credit suisse andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc good morning first question is around the real pickup in activity in the life sector around these annuity blocks notably we saw a bid for american equities sic american equity on something and then we saw equitable with their variable annuity transaction and now youve put your fixed annuity business in runoff so the question is are you seeing a lot of interest in your fixed annuity block and as well in your variable annuity block and whats your appetite is this something that you think you might do in the near term walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc hi andrew its walter the answer is yes as we are seeing increased interest in these blocks and certainly as weve indicated the fixed annuity block is certainly one that we said its not a matter if its a matter of when so that is clearly something that we are exploring and as we also indicated that we certainly will look at other potential activity in variable annuities and other activities within our retirement protection block so yes we are certainly evaluating and certainly looking at the alternative implications of it andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it and any sense of the capital in the variable annuity business that you could free up from something like that walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc well yeah obviously you see the allocated capital we have its at this stage its at with the markets etcetera lower end but it would free up a reasonable amount but you would have to then make the tradeoff into the earnings so thats something that we are constantly evaluating and certainly on the fixed annuity its a better equation andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it and then just shifting over to advice wealth management you had transactional activity picked up a little bit i think it was like sequentially but still down somewhat from last year do you see that area picking up any time soon or is this covid environment very pressured and maybe contrast that a little bit with your record quarterly wrap account flows of billion in the quarter james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes andrew ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc obviously the transactional is driven by the annuities insurance and thats been impacted but we are seeing improvements and so we are certainly that will be were expecting that would continue but it will be measured andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc and on the wrap side just what is that sustainable at billion plus that was a terrific number walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc its i think that we are enjoying good very strong productivity and certainly we feel comfortable with the continued growth andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc all right terrific thanks a lot operator our following question comes from humphrey lee from dowling partners humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc good morning and thanks for taking my questions i guess my first question is given the recent transactions in the asset management space and the industrys kind of ongoing quest for scale how do you see like ameriprise as a potential buyer or a potential sale of the asset management business or do you think you can kind of stay the course and grow organically and remain competitive james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes hi this is jim cracchiolo we feel very good about our asset management business today as part of ameriprise and we are as youve seen been very focused on investing in the business really rounding out the business appropriately to places where we think that we can really provide good active management both domestically and internationally weve been investing in our platform in our capabilities in our products and services in widening our distribution capabilities and were getting some good traction now having said that we think the world continues to consolidate we agree we think that there may be some opportunities for inorganic in addition to the organic so were very open to continue to explore those opportunities but were not looking to get rid of our asset management business in fact were looking to ensure that we can really have a good strong quality asset manager and that we can grow in the environments in which we will be in humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 got it and then looking at the expenses for the quarter they continue to be a good story as i think about the million yearoveryear lower expense target that you laid out last quarter like how much of that would be a permanent reduction as opposed to something that will come back when we come out the pandemic james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah very good question ill start and then walter can complement my answer so we are as you know there are a number of savings that came out rather quickly because of the lower te and less travel and expenses for people in certain of their activities and we think that that will gradually come back we dont think thats going to be a bounce back because we think we are moving to a world that even if the environment starts to open up there are efficiencies of operating somewhat virtually and some of the things that weve done and are doing versus just get back out to the travel that once we and others have done so there will be some permanent savings from that but some of that cost will come back on a gradual basis depending on how the economy opens up and travel is allowed from that perspective however we are continuing to reengineer and so a number of the costs that we are reducing we think will sustain and even though we will be probably investing in growing in certain respects as we said were also looking for further efficiencies and so we have our reengineering plans to keep expenses tight but that also assumes that we will continue to invest appropriately but we will manage our expenses quite well but in that regard we have not gone into any major restructurings at this point in time we have not laid off people in this environment and it depends on the environment were going into but weve been always able to manage our expenses while you saw that through this and we will be able to continue to do that as we move into humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc got it thank you james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc walter you have anything to add on that or walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc no no i think you covered it operator our next question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey thanks good morning jim good morning walter question maybe building on the commentary on ma in the question earlier so help me get to maybe a little bit more understanding in terms of if some opportunities came about on the ma side within asset management are we talking more kind of holistic integrations are more sort of targeted kind of tuckin acquisitions that gives you more kind of product or distribution capabilities and if so what are sort of the pieces of the mosaic that you guys feel like youre missing within the asset management ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 business so scale deals just kind of adding to what you have versus more tactical kind of product capability deals james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so alex i would probably say put it this way we feel like we have a pretty rounded global asset manager today it doesnt mean that we couldnt add complementary products we couldnt expand in certain of those disciplines in certain regions or international or domestic we think we can were not the largest asset manager out there but we do have a good makeup today and there are always products and services particularly of a little more in the solutionsoriented space maybe its some more in the fixed income space some expanded distribution maybe a little more in the institutional space so there are different ways that we would look at complementary activities regarding whether it would be a fit in you know something smaller that would be versus something a bit larger to get greater scale it really depends on the opportunity i think one of the things that ameriprise has done well with columbia threadneedle is weve been able to do both weve been able to take smaller acquisitions and fit them in and get complementary benefits and weve been able to do larger acquisitions such as the columbia deal where weve been able to integrate that very well derive good shareholder value at the same time getting a bigger rounded asset manager so i think some of the capabilities that we have in doing that i think weve proven that would be appropriate if theres something that would make sense for us to do but as i said were mainly focused on continuing our organic focus and then as opportunities arise evaluate alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you thanks for that and then maybe shifting gears a little bit i was hoping to talk about organic growth within the advice and wealth channel so you guys added significant number of advisors again this quarter i was hoping you could talk about sort of the productivity or the revenue sort of embedded in that pipeline of recruits and how should we think about the time between sort of you bringing these advisors in versus the revenue coming through because it feels like the recruiting dynamic has definitely picked up so i wonder whether and to what extent this could lead to sort of better organic growth over the next couple quarters james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so let me begin and then ill turn it over to walter to maybe more fully give you an answer what were seeing is we are bringing good advisors in that pipeline has picked up and our ability to actually have people join us is really good and strong but one of the keys also is how to onboard people and what weve found is that weve done a competitive review of this weve been able to bring people on board and very well and quicker really than many others and get them set up quicker to be really more productive and we find that that is very helpful for advisors making that transition now regarding what that looks like i think walter ill turn it to walter but the ramp up still takes a little bit because its not where they start day one but that does ramp up over the next number of periods so walter why dont you cover that walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc so alex on the rampup from a near experience advisor its in a two to three year cycle to get back to the trailing gdc so youll start seeing that and obviously it builds up after the first six months and that starts once they onboard so you can start seeing that trend line take place as were heading and were getting the throughput coming through for the additional advisors coming in ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you great and the last to the last one on again advice and wealth thanks by the way for all the added disclosure around interest rate sensitivity so kudos to alicia and her team for getting it out there but if you were to think about the pressure on awm from the spread business it feels like were basically there and its all in a run rate so just curious if you can confirm that and b since thats such an important input into the margin dynamic for awm can you talk a little bit about the trajectory for margin expansion from here off of cut on this 19ish rate that we saw in the quarter thanks james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes so alex ill let walter answer the interest rate first and then ill get to the margin expansion walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc well on the interest rate yes you are seeing that the basic steady state is there from that standpoint and on the sweep accounts and certainly well start seeing the improvement coming in from the bank but on these sweep accounts you should its built in at this stage just steady state run rate james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and then alex when we look at the margin overall for the business we continue as you saw to have good productivity increases with our advisors we continue to have good uptakes of our tools and capabilities that our advisors are feeling very good about and even in operating in this virtual environment and as they continue to really use those tools more fully as we continue to help them manage through this environment we feel very good about their ability to bring in client flows and to keep those clients active and focused on their goals and as many of our clients now have their goals even tracked online which is very helpful so no we feel good about that journey i mean there are always going to be blips up and down based on quarters and activity but overall we feel like we can continue that journey and our productivity has been quite good against the industry alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc awesome thanks guys operator our next question comes from john barnidge from piper sandler john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co much of the institutional outflow as you noted came from a low fee longterm client have you gone through asset management mandates to identify other potential low fee flows at risk for withdrawal james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes so we had like this quarter there were these two right part of one of them that insurance mandate we lost part of that in the last quarter was included in our net flows because of the sale of the business and this was the ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 second part that came out as the net of that we actually got some of the client proceeds back to reinvest but on a small amount based on what was transferred and then the other one was it was a very longterm client that had a reallocation and so those things happen from time to time you cant predict those things depending on the cycle that youre in but we feel again good about the type of mandates that were winning i think lost in this is that you got the size of that outflow but the mandates were winning have higher fee theyre across all three regions theyre in good product whether they be equity fixed income or in even property so we actually feel like if we can continue to grow those type of mandates the fees will more than offset anything that you will get on some of those bumpy outflows yes we always look at what clients and what type the potential redemption but i think we had a little more of that this year because of the cycle and the reallocation and some sales of activities the earlier part of the year we had a very low short term one from another longterm client so there are things like that already embedded in the flows this year but the new inflows were getting we feel very good about john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co great thank you and my followup i think you may have alluded to this a little bit with the protection but do you have a view on potential secular demand change for traditional life insurance products from the health crisis james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well i think you saw it very clearly with the low interest rate environment some of those products that were really growing in a lot of space previously over the last two or three years now have shifted a bit and for us were very focused on making sure that our clients get the range of products so its not just what we offer but its also what we offer from all of our competitive frame but we have seen a pickup in some of the variable universal type activities that a little more asset accumulation we feel theres a good opportunity there for us whether its a permanent i think there is a bit more focus coming back on having insurance appropriate protection but i also would say in this environment its probably not the first thing advisors are looking to sell and thats why some of the longdated contracts its starting to come back nicely but its taken a bit longer operator our next question comes from nigel dally from morgan stanley nigel p dally q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks good morning so i had a question on asset management clearly very strong margins this quarter exceeding the upper end of your guidance range even if we back out that million of onetime items so the question is around sustainability should we now expect margins given some of the shift in the assets which youre attracting towards being higher fee to remain at or modestly above your prior guidance absent big swings in the markets or is the prior guidance range of to still a better target as we go towards james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so i think as you saw we are getting good fee for the products that we both have and are growing and weve maintained those fees over time but i would probably say i would still put it back in a range of the to on ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 average is the way were looking at it at which i think youll find will be a very strong margin on a competitive universe and so thats the way i would think about it walter do you have anything to add on that walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc no i think really as a look on average over time were still in the to i think jim here is spot on on that nigel so i think thats a good guidance nigel p dally q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator our next question comes from jeremy campbell from barclays jeremy campbell q analyst barclays capital inc hey thanks just couple of follow ups in asset management can you give us a sense of the feed rate differential between the outflowing products mandates and the inflowing strategies james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so if were talking about institutional i would probably say that the relative is probably maybe to to something like that maybe probably yeah probably about times the higher fee on the new coming in something i dont have the exact but its in that ballpark jeremy campbell q analyst barclays capital inc great and then sorry if you guys covered this juggling a couple calls today but second consecutive quarter of retail inflows can you give us an idea of what products and strategies are flowing well in that channel james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so on the retail side we are getting good flows in our income equity income oriented products in our dividend categories but were also seeing inflows in some of our fixed income were seeing it in a few other of the sort of equity type and solutions so its varied but if i had to pick a bigger category for us our equities is actually one of the bigger area for us in inflows and mainly in the income oriented space and then we have growth in the fixed income more in sort of the varied solutions multiassets like strategic income and other places like that jeremy campbell q analyst barclays capital inc great and then just finally just maybe as a followup to alexs question and i know you mentioned kind of solutions when he asked about ma earlier but as you kind of look especially ion the retail part of the asset management equation here is there any kind of product or strategy where you have some white space that ideally you might like to shade in whether its building organically or doing a kind of bolton inorganically ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well i would probably say so first of all i think there is significant room for us based on our performance and the type of products weve had the credit orientation that we have to really grow our fixed income space but we have a lot of good product i think we need to just take a bit more space in the channels that were in both domestically and institutionally i do believe that if i look at some other areas to look at we feel like theres an opportunity for us to grow our property business particularly in the uk we feel good about the mix we have in the product but its not to say that we couldnt add some more in sort of the solutionoriented space or maybe even gain a bit more traction in the leveraging of our international lineup so now within that theres always some products to fit in but i think we have some good core capabilities were not in like in fixed income there are some of the larger core plus products etcetera that there are some larger providers that get a bit more flows but i think we have a very good credit orientation in our fixed income that we can gain more space jeremy campbell q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks a lot operator our next question comes from tom gallagher from evercore thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi good morning just wanted to follow up on the risk transfer question and what youre thinking there i know the question was asked about would you consider broadening out from fixed annuities to variable annuities but i guess my question is are you or would you contemplate something even bigger which might include your long term care book i think in the past walter youve mentioned the bidask spread was probably too wide but given i would say recent developments could a potential risk transfer deal be even larger and include potentially all of riversource life james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc walter why dont you respond to that walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc tom as we said we will evaluate certainly opportunities has to make sense from a shareholder standpoint but certainly we would evaluate reinsurance we are seeing interest and inbounds coming in and again it does get back to what is the best interest of the shareholder we have certainly our product capability and what it generates is quite good so on that basis yes were open for opportunities as they present themselves thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi and i guess just a followup for jim or walter and if depending on how big you would consider going with risk transfer would you consider a full divestiture of the life and annuity business or do you still feel like thats kind of a key core piece of the goforward franchise ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so tom i would say this we feel as weve said in the past we feel very good about this area in regard to what we have what we manage how it adds in to our solution set with advisors now strategically we will always evaluate what would be appropriate opportunity here that would if it can leverage the business better or in some way be good for the client be good for the shareholder and employees so we are open always to evaluate and were open to have good dialogue if something does make sense but as walter said i mean there are a number of options here including sort of reinsurance both on a product or even on some kind of portfolio basis as well and so yes we will always entertain where maybe with a certain partner or partners it could be leveraged and presented in a way that can be good for us and good for them and good for our clients so thats the way we would think about it but we think about that for the business overall every day thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi got it thats helpful and then just my followup is the bank seems to be consuming a decent amount of capital and i know thats been part of the awm well call it franchise buildout or an enhancement plan how do you think about sort of the capital return on capital associated with those continued investments relative to awm is a great cash flow generator capitallight business but i guess as you as more money is being put behind the bank it becomes a little more capital intensive how are you thinking about that balance right now james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so overall i mentioned strategically and walter can talk to you a little more about tactically is we feel like the bank the kinds of products adding to our client orientation are good and appropriate our advisors want some of those products and services for the clients as part of the portfolio of a deeper relationship were not looking to like some others grow the bank separately or apart from its really an adjunct to our wealth management business so were not really looking to build a large bank portfolio commercially or in an orientation of just direct to clients and adding those type of portfolios or higher credit risk in that portfolio based on the consumers just coming in as a direct lending opportunity so things like pledge activity things like mortgages and home equity is attached the things where like credit cards and other things attached to the client activities we feel are good and appropriate i think what weve seen right now and your point is very valid i mean right now because of interest rates and spreads are a little tighter its not generating as high a return as it could be in a more normalized environment but we feel like things over time can normalize we can invest out appropriately and get some better spreads than we get with sweep we think that we can get some good returns from the business and actually add to our margin and since its on a client orientation it does reinforce the relationships that we do have and so yes it takes a bit more capital up front but its not as though the awm business doesnt generate tremendous amount of capital that can be utilized for it so we feel it is a complement but walter i dont know if you want to add anything walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah the only thing i would add listen tom you know we generate a lot of equity and clearly we have the capacity to grow the bank and as jim said it does add basically spread margin to the business based on picking ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 up over basis points with really investing in a high quality book so yes that we are balancing those equations but we feel we have the capacity and makes sense at that thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thanks operator our next question comes from suneet kamath from citi suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks good morning i just wanted to stick with the bank first so walter i think when we originally started talking about the bank you had guided to maybe million of earnings over sort of a fiveyear period obviously the rate environment has changed but just wondering if you could provide an update in terms of where you think bank earnings could be in a couple years walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc well as we talked about it that was a different set of circumstance in spread but we do believe certainly the bank will make a reasonable contribution but we are again the spreads that we were anticipating are of what we anticipated when we were doing it but it really does make sense it will make significant contributions to awm but were being measured about it so its going to be a slower trajectory on that one suneet i just cant give you the numbers because really sticking with this sort of situation it really gets into whats available out there and where we do see spreads going but it is growing and were growing it and were getting a good return its giving us reasonable returns and its generating income and with really very prudent asset investments suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay just to followup on that then if we cant get the earnings number can you just help with the margin that youd expect to generate from that bank walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah the margin on a bank is in the to range clearly on that basis a reasonable range suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc got it okay and then sorry did you want to add anything else walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc no no suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 okay sorry so then just to circle back on recruiting and i guess maybe for jim recruits in a quarter is a pretty big number and i know cultural fit has been a huge part of your recruiting story in the past so how do you get comfortable recruiting that many people in what i assume is a completely virtual recruiting environment how do you make sure that the cultural fit is there when you cant meet face to face james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so were doing a lot of virtual engagement so when were talking to both the recruits and both for them can make an informed decision and for us to make that decision as well they are in contact with both strong in this field leadership with the recruiters even with executive management we hold a lot of events and activities so that they can really kick the tires virtually of what we do and how we do it from a technology a marketing on support our advice value proposition the leadership the training the development and so we want people to make an informed decision to join us and we want that decision to be informed from our end that they would actually work out well here and be productive and help them grow their practices so we feel good about what weve been able to do there i think you could see from some of the people joining us they are joining us for the value proposition overall the technology the integration of that technology how weve helped people grow their practices the support that we give them the culture that we have i think those things are all very critical yes its always would be helpful that if youre in person you can see and touch somebody a little more in that sense but i think on the other side of it is people are still able to make informed decisions and connect but it is one where there is effort that goes into that appropriately for them to make those decisions but i think thats an excellent question suneet and i think we have all been learning for how to operate virtually a bit better and we probably all long for the time when we can get back out but i think it has worked well and people can see the difference of how theyre supported today and what theyre looking for the future suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc can you just touch on competition for advisors in particular with respect to compensation james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc sure so i think its always a competitive world out there and so i think as you look at it we offer i think competitive comp packages appropriate for the advisor their productivity and what they can do in their growth and rampup therell always be some people who will toss a bit more money at an advisor and if the advisor leaves to do the extra money per se thats not necessarily always the ideal situation but we feel like for both what we do and what we evaluate and the type of people we bring on board we feel like it is a good commensurate package for both the advisor as well as for the firm and what we can do in helping that person become productive and the returns that we can get when that happens suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc got it thanks jim james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2020 and these are evaluated both individually and holistically with both the awm business orientation as well as walters financial organization operator our next question comes from erik bass from autonomous research erik bass q analyst autonomous research llp hi thank you i was just hoping you could provide an update on the current state of the dol fiduciary rule and the secs regulation best interest and how do you see the outlook for these potentially changing if we get democratic control of the white house and congress james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc good question so we have been able to fully execute against the secs best interest standard appropriately and that went fully into place we feel very good operating under it as well if theres a full change in the both the administration and congress and there is something that comes changes again or comes back based on previous proposals i actually would say that ameriprise is very wellsituated in a competitive set to deal effectively with it we have very strong standards against the best interest of what we implemented even before the sec moved to what theyve moved to we have great compliance both from a field of centralized resources we do look at all of the products and services that we sell we have very good due diligence in place and what some of the additional things that would have been required we were ready to move on previously since they were being enacted so i would actually say it might be a competitive benefit and circumstance on a relative basis not that we would want more regulation etcetera but i think we would be very able to handle it erik bass q analyst autonomous research llp thank you and then just a quick followup for walter is there any goforward earnings impact from the assumption updates in unlocking walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc there will be some minor but we are evaluating that right now but there will be some minor going forward erik bass q analyst autonomous research llp okay thanks but i mean any quantification you can give or i mean it sounds like it wont be sizable walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc theres multiple its totally manageable from that standpoint but it will have some impact erik bass q analyst autonomous research llp okay thank you ameriprise financial inc
