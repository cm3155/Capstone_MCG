its core to how we operate we also returned more than million to shareholders which was of our adjusted operating earnings and among the best in financial services for the full year we returned close to billion very clearly our ability to consistently generate substantial free cash flow as well as to reinvest and return to shareholders are key differentiators for us lets turn to advice wealth management where we delivered a very strong quarter and good organic growth beginning with our clients were delivering a differentiated level of advice keeping clients focused on their goals which was key in a volatile disruptive year total client assets were up to billion driven by excellent client flows and positive markets as you know weve built a leading investment advisory business and it continues to grow nicely in the quarter wrap net inflows were close to billion up over last year this was another record for us and a great indication of our excellent clientadvisor engagement and focus on growth ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 another highlight was transactional activity bouncing back and up over last year and client cash balances continue to grow and ended the quarter at billion up billion from last quarter meanwhile were continuing to invest to make our offering even more compelling for clients and advisors we continue to see very good engagement in our digital capabilities allowing advisors and clients to interact and transact seamlessly and the majority of clients now have their goals online and follow their progress our advisors are utilizing our tools and capabilities on our integrated technology platform they are reporting that theyre processing business more efficiently and spending more time with their clients and growing their practices thats evident in increased financial planning and advisor productivity which was up adjusting for interest rates youve heard me share that one of the greatest benefits of being an ameriprise advisor is our caring culture including truly bestinclass support and strong field leadership i recently spoke with all of our field leaders to kick off the year theyre energized about ameriprise and are focused on continuing to drive productivity and growth this high level of support is also reflected in our recruiting success our virtual recruiting program is extremely effective and continues to drive strong results with experienced advisors joining us in the fourth quarter were recruiting top advisors from across the industry who recognize that ameriprise offers the value proposition technology and level of support that can help them deliver an exceptional advisorbased client experience and take their practices to the next level of success and we have a track record of helping advisors grow times faster than peers which is very compelling from a competitive perspective so far in this momentum continues and the recruiting pipeline remains strong it was also great to see that our client service teams were once again recognized by jd power for the excellent experience they deliver this certification recognizes best practices from the highest performing contact centers across all industries not just financial services regarding the bank total assets grew to billion with billion of sweep deposits we plan to move additional deposits to the bank this year we also added pledge loans to the product portfolio in the quarter and were seeing a good response to date its an appealing product for higher net worth clients seeking liquidity wrapping up awm margin was strong at and was up basis points sequentially as i mentioned earlier expenses continue to be well managed with ga up only and that includes investments in the bank next retirement protection solutions this business is performing well and in line with our expectations were executing our plan to drive a mix shift in the business focusing on higher returning products given the rate environment which is further reducing our risk variable annuity sales increased nicely up driven by the success of the structured product we introduced earlier in the year more than offsetting reduced sales of living benefit products very importantly this increased the percentage of va sales without living benefits which grew to of total sales in the quarter in protection while sales were down yearoveryear weve seen improvement quartertoquarter sales of our flagship vul product doubled in the quarter offsetting the reduced sales from iul products this product both better meets clients needs in this rate environment while generating good returns for the firm clearly as ameriprise continues to grow overall the retirement protection solutions segment will represent a smaller part of our business mix over time ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 with regard to fixed annuities i know some of you are interested in our progress regarding a reinsurance transaction we are actively looking to execute a transaction this year and are encouraged by the recent uptick in the 10year rate turning to asset management we continue to build on our progress and have a great story to share as an active manager the team is serving clients well and driving profitable growth we continue to have excellent client engagement and investment performance the investments were making including in data and digital are helping to drive organic growth at columbia threadneedle with strong results in north america were targeting advisors better and delivering a compelling experience and importantly we strengthened our relationship with our distribution partners across regions including with the large brokerdealer firms and independents in the us were also investing in our operating platform including important work to reduce duplicate legacy systems in the quarter we completed the final phase of the installation of our global trading portfolio management system which will help our investment teams and drive additional efficiency and scale globally with a continuation of positive flows and positive markets assets under management grew to billion our asset management business is making strong contributions to our overall earnings and free cash flow and margin for the quarter was nearly looking ahead we expect to remain in the to range however if these market levels hold we should come in at the higher end strong investment performance has been essential to our success and our teams have been collaborating really well through this pandemic we have steadily invested to build a strong global platform with a disciplined research focus and our people are delivering exceptional performance across all categories equities fixed income and multiasset strategies at yearend columbia threadneedle had four and fivestar funds which shows the breadth and strength of our product lineup in equities on a global basis over of our funds on an assetweighted basis were above medium or beating benchmarks over one three and fiveyear periods and thats across domestic and international strategies with regard to fixed income we also had great performance more than of our taxable funds on an asset weighted basis were above medium or beating benchmarks over the same time frames so with this type of investment performance and the growth focus across the business flows continue to be strong overall excluding former parent outflows we were net positive billion for the quarter an improvement of billion from a year ago in terms of total retail flows excluding former parent we were net positive by billion including reinvested dividends these positive flows were driven by continued momentum in the us where we were net inflows for months of the year and that included the dislocation in march for the quarter us retail had billion of net inflows in fact columbia strategies were in net inflows and had gross sales in excess of billion in and thats across equities fixed income and our multimanager lineup ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 in emea retail we were in net inflows of more than million in the quarter with particular strength in continental europe which more than offset outflows in the uk were optimistic that the resolution of brexit and the gradual reopening of the uk economy will be positive in terms of investor sentiment and in terms of global institutional we continue to gain traction have a significant opportunity and platform to grow we have a compelling lineup of capabilities and excellent investment performance we recently added to our consultant relations team and strengthened client service in the quarter we had net inflows ex former parent of about million driven by continued strength in emea the pipeline looks attractive across our regions but when i look across asset management im very pleased with the momentum over the last number of quarters and our ability to sustain it stepping back to ameriprise overall were in a terrific position were delivering strong result and further reinforcing our record of navigating uncertain times im incredibly proud of our employees and advisors and the resilience that theyve shown during this pandemic theyve stayed focused on our clients while continuing to drive the strong results youre seeing nearly a month into i feel very good about the high level of client engagement and business activity that were generating from a capital perspective were continuing to deliver a differentiated level of return our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent and were generating strong free cash flow with that walter will cover the quarter in more detail and then ill take your questions walter stanley berman chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc thank you jim ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics with adjusted operating eps up as strong underlying organic growth more than offset headwinds from low interest rates assets under management and administration reached a record trillion including nearly billion of inflows from wrap and asset management we achieved our targeted reengineering for the year while investing for future growth in advice wealth management and asset management we continue to effectively manage our profile with continued mix shifts to lower risk higher margin retirement protection solution offerings and are actively exploring additional reinsurance opportunities in we returned over billion of capital to shareholders our strong balance sheet fundamentals coupled with sustained underlying business growth are driving free cash flow generation across our business segments this positions us well as we enter lets turn to slide ameriprise adjusted operating net revenue grew driven by strong underlying business trends and equity market appreciations after excluding the benefit of million of higher shortterm interest rates in the prior period general and administrative expenses are down even as we make investments for growth including the bank expenses also include higher compensation associated with the impact of amp share price appreciation in the quarter and strong business performance we are able to achieve this result through disciplined reengineering initiatives in total we delivered strong underlying eps growth excluding interest rates of over and very strong margins in the quarter ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 turning to slide as jim mentioned advice wealth management delivered robust organic growth we continue to benefit from sustained traction in experienced advisor recruiting our personalized client experience effectiveness of our digital tools and success in reaching more of our target market as you can see in these core areas we had strong growth in client assets wrap flows and advisor productivity this is a good foundation as we move forward on page financial results in advice wealth management was strong with underlying adjusted operating earnings up to million after the million interest rate headwind this was driven by strong wrap net inflows improved transactional activity and higher market levels as well as continued expense management pre tax adjusted operating margin was which would have been a basis points improvement yearover year excluding change in interest rates on a sequential basis the margin improved basis points turning to page asset management delivered very good financial performance and continued improved flow trends the cumulative impact of outflows has been a significant headwind for us in the past as flows improved this year that has declined and if inflows continue this would provide a tailwind for us in in the quarter we had inflows of billion excluding former parent related flows which is a billion improvement from a year ago investment performance ph table stake for net inflows is excellent across a diverse product set adjusted operating revenues were million revenue increased reflecting improved flow trends stable fee rate and market appreciation after normalizing for the timing of the performance fees general and administrative expenses remain well managed reflecting disciplined expense reengineering that funded investments for growth adjusted for the timing of performance fees and other compensationrelated expense ga increased putting this together pretax adjusted operating earnings grew with a margin overall we are very encouraged by the continued progress the business is making that is resulting in both strong flows and financial performance lets turn to page retirement protection solutions continue to perform in line with expectations in this market and rate environment we are executing our strategy to shift our risk profile in the quarter of sales were on products without living benefits up a year ago driven by our new structured variable annuity product along with the decline in sales of va products with living benefits in protection sales were down in total with a meaningful increase in highermargin vul and a significant decline in indexed universal life a product that is not as attractive in this rate environment these mix shifts are expected to continue going forward financial results continued to be in line with expectations pretax adjusted operating earnings increased to million like the industry we are seeing an uptick in claim counts related to covid19 but weve experienced a limited financial impact overall claims were more favorable than the prior year this business is well managed net amount at risk remains among the lowest in the industry and our hedging has been extremely effective turning to page in total the corporate other segment had a million loss in the quarter which was a million improvement from the prior year excluding the closed blocks the loss in corporate segment improved to million the prioryear period had elevated losses related to impairments in the affordable housing portfolio the current year had approximately million of incremental compensation expense related to the impacts of share price appreciation and company performance ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 in our closed blocks longterm care had million of earnings in the quarter due to a significant increase in terminations and lower new claims fixed annuities had a million loss related to the low interest rate environment we continue to evaluate opportunities to execute additional reinsurance transactions this year now lets move to the balance sheet on the last slide our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong including a liquidity position of billion at the parent company substantial excess capital of billion hedge effectiveness in the quarter and for the full year as well as a defensively positioned investment portfolio adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at we returned million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback totaling over billion for the full year overall this was an excellent result for the quarter with that well take your questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from andrew kligerman from credit suisse andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc hey good morning id like to start with the advice wealth wrap net flows billion was phenomenal just ago we thought the run rate was just a little over billion could you give a little color on the background what drove it so high this quarter and what might be a sustainable range james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes andrew this is jim we continued to see a good pickup of activity over the course of the year we were still having very strong wrap flows even in the prior quarter as you saw in our results over the year but we saw a bit of an increase in the fourth quarter we actually grew our client base our new client acquisition picked up even more and we saw a good level of activity with our advisors now some of that could be people feeling a little better as the vaccine came about as well and the idea that the economy and activities would continue to open up but i would probably say weve seen a more consistent strong flow coming in so we feel good about the underlying growth factors and it was both from the legacy clients that we have organically as well as some new clients that we added andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc i see great and then with regard to general and admin across the board just a real solid outcome down yearoveryear i think earlier last year you were guiding to about million expense general and admin decline yearoveryear and it was down about million as we looked at the quarter and i think some of that was the share price some of that was maybe other investments that you were making in the company but just ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 kind of looking forward could you kind of see another million pickup getting back into that million objective could you go further where are you looking toward ga into james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc okay so we definitely more than achieved the reengineering goal that we mentioned to you of million so thats sort of embedded in our numbers i think what youre seeing overall and weve been talking about that not just for like the fourth quarter but over the course of the remaining part of the year after the pandemic and so we had increased our reengineering goals in that regard and we did achieve them our expenses are being managed very well but i would also say we did also increase some investments we were making we wanted to accelerate because of the great productivity were having to even add a bit more in some of the technology and the capabilities that we wanted to bring to both the advisors and from a client perspective and our web activities so our investment agenda last year was actually a bit higher in total dollars than in the year before so that was embedded in our numbers what i would say is the pickup you saw in a little bit of expenses were more from the stock price appreciation and what that does in some of our deferral programs on a marktomarket and that absorbed and some trueups and some compensation based on the year and the strong fourth quarter so i feel good about the expenses going into the new year i think they will increase if the economy opens up a bit more as we bring travel and te and some other expenses back to some extent and we continue our investment agenda but i think were going to manage expenses pretty well and you know how we do that over time but well continue to look at the business growth the revenue growth and the market climate as we do that andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it and maybe just lastly on the fixed annuity block i think you lost about million in the quarter target was to free up about million in capital but with kind of a moneylosing line like that do you think youll get close to the million and how imminent is that fixed annuity block sale james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc okay ill let walter respond on the fixed annuity side walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc so as jim said and i said in ph my talks we are certainly actively looking and we do believe that certainly we have freed up the capital thats there and then we have gauged the indiscernible implications of the rate but we certainly feel that we will free up a reasonable amount of capital and were working to evaluate andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc all right thank you jim and walter ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc youre welcome operator our next question comes from humphrey lee from dowling partners humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc good morning and thank you for taking my questions just staying with awm for a moment the transactional activities for mutual funds and long duration products appear to be back to prepandemic levels can you talk about how they trended throughout the quarter and what you are seeing into january james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes so we definitely saw a pickup as we went from the second to the third to the fourth quarter in transaction activities and they got back more back to a normal level in fact they were up over the year before is fourth quarter so we felt good the pickup was as you mentioned both in the brokerage activity but as well as in some long duration even in our own business where we sell our annuities there was a strong pickup and continued in our structured annuity business and even a pickup in the insurance business so we feel like weve gotten back to a more normalized level and were thinking that that will continue as we go through the new year humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc got it and then in terms of kind of capital deployment as you plan for can you remind us kind of how you think about capital deployment priority in terms of returning to shareholders versus ma for whether its awm or asset management james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so we have a consistent capital deployment strategy as youve seen over the years we first of all make the right investments in the business that we think are good and appropriate for us that well get strong growth and productivity from from there we then evaluate the opportunities that may from both continuing to us to increase our dividend buyback appropriately based on the free cash flow that we generate which is very strong but we also evaluate acquisition opportunities and in that regard we do see that there is more opportunities coming about but were very disciplined of what would strategically help us grow what we can get good returns what would fit into both our culture and the environment to keep us on track and so we will continue to evaluate that we have excess capital that would help along those lines as well as what we would do as we look out based on the cash that we generate so thats the way we look at it we havent changed that philosophy and well continue to focus in that way as we move forward humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc okay ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc humphrey this is walter id just add that were still targeting about for this year i think your question was on buyback humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc okay i guess on the ma side just to elaborate a little bit is there any kind of preference between scale versus capabilities james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc we look more for additional capabilities and that will continue to add our ability for us to grow in certain acquisitions it does provide some additional scale we do and weve invested heavily into our platform capabilities and technology that we could add more assets with very minimal cost so we feel that we have that ability as well but primarily wed look strategically about how we continue to round out and have a strong quality asset manager globally humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc thats helpful thank you operator our next question comes from jeremy campbell from barclays jeremy campbell q analyst barclays capital inc hey thanks just want to stick there with asset management for a minute here and you give some good color but hopefully you could spend some time going into a little more detail around the fund flows and kind of just wondering which high performing strategies may be showing accelerating inflow momentum and maybe if there are strategies that are showing either a fading headwinds or an inflection from outflows to inflows any color there would be fantastic james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so i think if you look at our supplemental youll see first of all weve had a very strong investment performance across our fund family particularly if you look at take equities as an example are beating the benchmark on the one three and five year three and five year especially strong our fixed income strategies are strong threadneedle is having very strong performance across their range so we feel like we have a broader good lineup of funds as i mentioned too in my talking points there were over funds that grossed more than billion we had good net inflows in a number in the range of funds so its broadened from where we were so we are continuing to see good flow in equities or particularly in the incomeoriented equities across our lineup were seeing a pickup in activity in global and european activity in some of our funds there in fixed income we see it in certain of our income ranges like mortgages et cetera and you also in equities and manage the we have risk allocation funds that are doing well and also growth and were probably going to see a bit more of a ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 shift a little bit more into value maybe which we have a lineup there as well so i would say its broadened out so i would also reckon that if you look at our lineup in equities its been very strong as from a flow perspective jeremy campbell q analyst barclays capital inc and then anything notable thats maybe inflected from outflowsinflows in the past year as the overall numbers have improved james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc i dont have that in front of me but we can look at it i would probably say weve seen some turnaround in like some of our more concentrated funds that maybe the performance wasnt as strong previously that has bounced back where just based on the lower sales activity theres always a level of redemptions and so you move into a net outflow but i think some of those have really rectified themselves in some of our fund groups like contrarian and a few of the larger fund areas like that that are seeing some nice performance a select growth area et cetera so some of that is more of a yeah to your point a little bit more of a turnaround or adjustment in picking up of sales and lowering of the redemptions jeremy campbell q analyst barclays capital inc and then just one final one just a clarification on the fixed annuity block i think one thing weve heard in the industry is that with rates rising in the last quarter of the year like the bidask has widened out a little bit what are you guys seeing around demand for that block of assets especially now with blackstone getting even bigger among the alternative guys that have already played in the sandbox there too james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc walter you want to walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah its walter were seeing good demand as youre indicating and certainly while our spreads have widened excuse me rates have widened weve seen some narrowing spreads but we feel very comfortable that were in ranges that transactions could be executed jeremy campbell q analyst barclays capital inc thanks a lot guys operator our next question comes from kenneth lee from rbc capital markets kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 hi thanks for taking my question just one on the advice wealth management business weve been seeing a nice recovery in margins over the last few quarters just wondering if you could just give us a little bit of a color around where you think margins could trend over the near term thanks james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so i think what we would probably say is we see the trend line continuing we see our advisor productivity still quite strong up if you adjust for sort of the interest advisor productivity was up or more and thats across a very large base and so thats really positive weve seen a pickup as you saw in our flows and fees our financial planning is up so i would say that we want to continue to see that trend line of the margin continue to accrete we also think weve sort of hit a low point on the interest side of that and over time as we deploy a bit more into the bank and get some spread there that would be helpful as well so i would probably want to see that margin continue to be targeted to get back into the 20plus percent range kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thats very helpful and just one quick followup just on that fixed annuity reinsurance again and it sounds like its not too much dependent on 10year yields further rising but i just wanted to check in to see whether the outlook for executing a transaction is predicated on any further increase in 10year yields thanks walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc well i would say were in the range and certainly from that stand with the rates where they are and looking at the spreads that our transactions can be done so while certainly itd be beneficial if you get a higher rate coming in but we are certainly feeling comfortable in this range and we are as jim indicated pursuing kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc great very helpful thank you operator our next question comes from tom gallagher from evercore thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc good morning just i guess a followup on what youre thinking on risk transfer is one of the reasons that we havent heard that youve executed a fixed annuity deal yet because youre considering doing something broader on risk transfer potentially including the long term care or other insurance businesses or should we think about those potential transactions being done separately james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so tom i would probably say as we look at it and ill have walter comment we always evaluate our businesses and look at them both individually and collectively but theres nothing that ties together us doing a fixed annuity transaction versus evaluating something in addition to or different than so walter ill let you ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah so let me just say this on fixed annuities theres a higher confidence and clearly from our standpoint thats what were focusing on but as jim has said we will entertain and look at that from that standpoint with the quality of our book and the earnings and everything it certainly has potential and we will continue to evaluate it but right now were focused on fixed annuities james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah the other thing i would say tom is as you saw we have shifted our emphasis and also both the new business being put on but also the current business derisk a lot in our book just like we had closed off fixed are shifting now to structured from guarantees are shifting from fixed insurance to variable which is a better product both for the client and us in this rate environment so were continuing to change that mix and the shift of that mix but we will definitely continue to evaluate if there are other books that could be or should be reinsured or that would make sense for us thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc got you thats helpful i guess a question on advice wealth and jim ive heard your comments about i guess the confidence in terms of the quality of the flows and is it fair to say that the move up to almost billion of wrap flows could be a new level that you might be able to sustain and i guess just relatedly i just want to make sure there was nothing unusual or unsustainable in this quarters result like big ticket new advisors transferring assets over do you feel like this could be a new hire level for awm indiscernible james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i would say tom as i mentioned all of the flow mainly the increase of the total flows weve had more of an ongoing of bringing in new advisors and so there is nothing special in the fourth quarter it was a continuation weve continued to bring in a good level of top advisors in the industry with good production but as you saw thats been consistent third quarter we brought in good even in the second quarter after the pandemic that picked up nicely and the first quarter was good so no that continues as an ongoing trend line in the sport of numbers but i would say that it was more of increased activity from our current client flows as well as new clients that our current advisors were bringing into the franchise now whether that continues at billion being the base i cant tell you that i think we all saw a pickup in some level of activities in the fourth quarter in the industry clients put some more money to work because maybe its a bit more optimism of the opening but i would say underlying it we feel good about the activity the level it wasnt like it went from billion to billion it was billion in the third quarter but whether its billion or billion or billion i cant tell you that exactly theres always some level of seasonality et cetera as well but i feel good about the underlying and i feel good that therell be a good underlying trend there as we move into this year if theres no major disruption so thats what i would say thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc okay thanks and then walter just one final one the tax rate moved up a little bit can you talk about how we should think about modeling it over the next year or two should we see a little bit of an increase because of the mix moving to some higher tax businesses now ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah so i think we pretty much hit our target for the yearend and youre correct i would say probably a good number to think about it will move up because of the business mix shift and were i would say move up maybe to would be something like a reasonable number thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc in and would you think or walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc no thats just thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc move up more gradual walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc best guess right now and thats without any change in tax laws obviously thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc okay thank you walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc welcome operator our next question comes from suneet kamath from citi suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks good morning i wanted to go back to the retail flows if we just think about it at a high level it seems like over the past couple of years on a gross basis your gross inflows have been tracking around billion a quarter and now were at something like billion for this year or for i guess the question is how much of this improvement would you say is due to unperformance and how much of it is due to sort of structural changes around distribution platforms and how youve improved your positioning there if theres any way that you can help us think about that james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc i think suneet its a combination of factors i think weve definitely first of all weve had some strong investment performance but i think its been very consistent and its been and now for some that were underperforming ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 has bounced back nicely as well so across a larger range we have very good performance so i think investment performance is part of a given here of whats necessary i think that the team has done a really a great job of broadening the distribution getting better relationships established more on the various platforms and the due diligence and et cetera i think we have a wide range of products that are a wider range that are being considered than in the past as well and particularly in certain categories that are making sense like i said in income categories so i think its a combination of factors that we worked hard at over the last number of years that is starting to show some good results weve made a lot of investments both in the awm business to continue to get flows and productivity and the same thing in the asset management business we continue we actually completed our whole trading and attribution platform in columbia threadneedle the ability to share research globally has improved the ability to actually get more data and analytics informed to our investment people our distribution people to improve targeting to understand where there might be some good opportunities i actually think that europe showed a nice bounce back remember we had to go through a lot of change there of establishing a whole european lineup of funds with brexit and it sort of took us out of the market a bit for a while and now that weve got that lineup established we saw really strong flows into europe this last quarter uks still a little weak because of the brexit and the economy being closed but we still see some signs that if that can open with brexit moving to another completion there that that would also help so i think its a combination of factors just as you said i wouldnt point to one but thats what gives us a good feeling as we move forward suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay and then i guess moving to awm if we look at the capital that you have in that segment its up about million yearoveryear im assuming thats based on the capital youre putting in the bank so the question is how much capital would you be willing to put in the bank to support growth and how do you think about sort of the tradeoff in terms of capital that you could use for other purposes and then growing the bank james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so i would start but ill let walter complete we feel like as we can continue to derive good margin and good returns from the bank activity as a complement to get greater spread or growth in various loan books there like our pledge assets was growing nicely in the fourth quarter we took over half of that book back and the growth is being picked up which is it will be a good product for us so we feel very comfortable continuing to add capital as required there as you can see our overall returns for the total firm are up in the mid to upper so its not as though we have a return issue and with still even with that our cash flow and what we generate is strong so it still gives us a good capital that we could continue to return or look for inorganic acquisitions so i dont think that is going to be a pressing issue for us but walter if you have something to comment walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc no the only thing ill add to that is that we have in our plan allocated additional capital for the growth that jim was talking about and feel comfortable and obviously the return is certainly good when we look at it relative to ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 the offbalance sheet so we feel comfortable with that and to then maintain that riskreturn equation so yes we have allocated more capital to it and we have the capacity to do that james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and also suneet as you can see whether we evaluate the sale and do a transaction of fixed annuities that will free up capital there or even lighten some of the areas of where we have in some of the fixed books suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc got it okay thanks operator our next question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey jim hey walter good morning a couple of followups around the asset management business as well could you guys talk a little bit around sort of the incremental improvement in retail flows that weve seen for several quarters now and by the way it feels like thats continuing into the new year which is great but that incremental improvement how much of that is coming from awm versus thirdparty distribution i know thats been a big focus to indiscernible thirdparty distribution platforms and as that occurs how sort of does that mix shift if its meaningful at all sort of impact the profitability for amp as a whole so in other words like if you get much bigger in thirdparty distribution does it impact sort of the net profitability for firmwide kind of flows that are coming through those channels james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so im not sure i understand the second part of the question but i would first and for the first part i would say weve seen a nice pickup through the thirdparty channels in complement to ameriprise ameriprise actually picked up a bit but what i would just say it is no different than what were seeing as a pickup across the major distributors that we have and so both had been positive in that regard because of the combination of the products that were put into market and the performance et cetera with regard to what does that mean the economics between the internal sale and the external sale to us is the same we pay the same on it the fees are the same on it et cetera so im not sure there is a material difference in that way but overall as you continue to get good flows i think the return will be good for us alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it all right if no material difference then we can skip like that second part i guess when it comes to ma youve given a little bit of color so it sounds like if you were to do something on the asset management ma side youre kind of looking at capability type of deals over kind of big deals for scale purposes alone so what are the capabilities that you guys still find compelling in particular to kind of better complement the rest of your platform ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so i would say alex as we looked at our business we have a good lineup we have scale we have a global platform today its not as though however i could say we have everything we would want in fixed or equities or solutions in all parts of the world so i think we individually evaluate that from sort of the core of what we do manage today as well as looking at more of the type of platforms that are necessary so were growing a bit more in our solutions business were adding some alternatives some real estate and things like that over time so its more of are there other distribution capabilities and other methods to add to and how we manage assets for clients things like that as well as from a product perspective were not against adding scale let me be very clear about that but it would have to be a transaction where it gives us a complement of things rather than we just want to put assets on the platform alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it all right it sounds like a pretty wide range thing i guess just a quick followup for walter i think there was an earlier question on ga at a firmwide level not i know people like to ask about awm but if you think about firmwide ga about billion in it sounds like that could grow a little bit if maybe te comes back and things like that what is a reasonable growth rate for over that billion number walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc alex like i said were managing expenses so well and were looking at the environment but i would say that you should look for a couple of basis points that we will evaluate on that a couple of percent points on that thats the range as we look at it and were looking to again continue our investment strategy at the same time with our reinsurance programs but thats a reasonable range a couple of percent points alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc right all right thanks guys walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc youre welcome operator our next question comes from ryan krueger from kbw ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning i just had a quick one could you talk a little bit about your expectations for further growth in the bank over the next year and the opportunity to move more sweep assets there james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 yeah ill begin and let walter so we see an opportunity to continue as we said both for the movement of some of our sweep activities further into the bank as you saw over the course of last year we moved the bank up from roughly billion to billion so we gradually started to shift more into the bank we see that continuing in the here in the new year were also trying to add more on the product capability like we picked up the pledge loan book we launched a mortgage product well start to look to add some deposit products other deposit products in the latter part of the year maybe into next year so there are different things like that were looking at but we feel the opportunity that well continue to shift a bit more into the bank on a gradual quarterly basis as we move forward ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc walter do you want to add anything walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc no i think as to the other part of your question we certainly have the capacity of our offbalance sheet to accommodate what jim just said to and in the plans that we filed to grow the bank and the capital so we have a certain position with that operator our last question comes from erik bass from autonomous research erik bass q analyst autonomous research llp hi thank you can you help us think about the overall organic growth in the awm business we can obviously see the wrap net flows and total client aum but are there other metrics you can point to that help to paint a more holistic view of organic net flows and new client growth and how this compares to some of your peers james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i could probably say that organic growth in client acquisition is up nicely both for the overall client base but in particular also for what we would call the targeted clients that we want in the indiscernible category that has been nice and strong and picked up nicely as we went through the quarters in the year the flows from the current client base continues to be good and actually picked up further in the fourth quarter as i said to you the years that were bringing in and the business and production theyre bringing in continues along the trend line that we spoke to you about particularly as we continue to move more years into both the employee channel and the independent channel and that has picked up nicely and continue to add scale to us so its a combination of factors we continue to get more efficient based on the technology we deploy that helps advisors concentrate more on their client engagement and can actually focus more on what they can do to deepen our advice formula is working really well we have more than of the majority of our clients now have goals online that they can track and progress with and see very visibly of what theyre doing and executing their ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 strategies so all of those things we feel really strengthen the underlying core of the base and so remember with the client base we have with the deepening we have with those clients with the further engagement around advice and with our advisors now feeling a little more comfortable dealing with the pandemic that they can go out and get more new clients and add clients in this environment or as the environment improves and open i think will be a positive for us so i cant judge it against any particular i know a number of our competitors have if i look at what the wire houses reported et cetera i think were standing pretty strong against that if i look at competitors that have acquired and have added through acquisitions of course youre always going to see an increase because of whats put on from that end on a comparative basis so i cant necessarily separate them but i feel organically and from a core business were doing very well erik bass q analyst autonomous research llp thank you appreciate that just one question for long term care obviously good results this quarter and how are you thinking about the potential for ibnr given that people may be eligible to make a claim but havent because of the pandemic and not wanting to enter a facility or have people come into their homes and i guess related to that kind of the improvement in the books performance over the last year does that have any potential impact on your ability to execute a reinsurance transaction for it james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc walter youve been working closely on that so walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc okay so as you saw this year we saw improvements in both unfortunately termination and less people entering into longterm care facilities we had not built any of that into our unlocking assumptions and we are not again were monitoring the situation and were seeing but with the programs weve put in place both on premium increase benefit shifts and things like that and the claims that were seeing we feel very good about the book and its risk situation erik bass q analyst autonomous research llp got it okay and so no change really in terms of the either appetite for reinsurance or kind of ability to execute something walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc weve seen some interest in it we feel very good about the position and the risk profile that we see but certainly weve seen some interest and well just continue to evaluate james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc i think as we continue to see what is happening both in our book but also as we evaluate client behavior or whats happening in that regard i think if anything the risk profile continues to look as more favorable and as people ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 28jan2021 better understand what that is in the marketplace and what they might be interested in i think it does open up some additional thoughts or opportunities possibly as we go forward so i think were very open to continue to see how that plays out and through and maybe that will provide other evaluation and opportunities as we go along erik bass q analyst autonomous research llp got it thank you appreciate the comments operator we have no further questions at this time thank you ladies and gentlemen this
