comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results and with that well turn it over to jim james m cracchiolo chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call what id like to do is give you my perspective on the environment and how ameriprise is performing then walter will cover the financials in terms of the market environment both equity and fixed income markets continued to decline in the third quarter both here and in europe inflation remains high and sticky and geopolitical risk is elevated this is causing a high level of volatility keeping investors on the sidelines a bit more ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 with that shortterm interest rates were up basis points so far this year with basis points raised just in the third quarter i believe that the fed and other central banks have been playing catch up and that they will have to continue in increasing rates to get inflation under control having said that it will lead to a slowing of the us and european economies and at this juncture it looks more like were heading for a mild recession therefore i expect there will be more volatility ahead so for ameriprise the diversity and strength of our business allows us to deliver good outcomes even in challenging times and you certainly saw that in our results this quarter we continue to remain in strong client inflows in wealth management and the rise in interest rates the growth of the bank and the stability of the retirement protection businesses helped to more than offset the effect of depreciating markets and foreign exchange that impacted our asset management business the investments we made in our business over the years in our technology client service product solutions and advice value proposition are paying dividends as we continue our strong focus on our clients and helping our advisors navigate a difficult environment now id like to discuss our third quarter results in more detail total assets under management and administration were trillion which is down from a year ago assets were impacted by the steep decline in both equity and fixed income markets and the strength of the dollar which affected the foreign exchange rate in our european business in terms of adjusted operating financials excluding unlocking revenues were billion up with that earnings per share were up to and the return on equity was strong at which is consistent with this time last year now lets talk a bit more about our businesses ill start with advice wealth management where we continue to deliver strong results despite the environment we had good client flows as clients remained engaged total client flows were up in the quarter to more than billion the mix of our flows reflect the environment were in we saw strong growth in brokerage cash certificates and other products as we expected cash balances continue to be up sharply to more than billion compared to more than billion just a year ago were seeing good growth across our cash offerings very importantly our advisor productivity remains strong as we continue to reinforce our personal relationships and the value of advice it was up to per advisor we recently met with our top advisors to recognize their success and discuss growth opportunities at ameriprise engagement was terrific advisors are highly satisfied with the firm and the support we provide and they like the technology and the capabilities weve added which is helping them grow which brings me to recruiting we had another very good quarter adding highly productive advisors advisors consistently tell us they recognize the strength of our value proposition our brand and the stability of the firm its a competitive marketplace and i feel good about our pipeline in the third quarter as we have all year we continue to invest steadily in the business we continue to release additional tools capabilities and enhancements that help our advisors engage and meet with clients deliver actionable advice and improve efficiency of their practices as part of our investment agenda weve been very much focused on expanding our cash offering and growing our bank the bank provides important flexibility in this rising interest rate environment and will continue to be a good opportunity for us to further engage and deepen our relationships with clients ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 we continue to move cash to the bank adding billion in the third quarter and with that weve been able to invest appropriately to garner additional spread today our bank has grown to nearly billion we also continue to see good growth in our pledge loan business and well be launching more products in the bank as we move forward overall the advice wealth management business continues to generate strong profitable growth and margins reached up basis points now lets turn to retirement protection solutions starting with variable annuities we have narrowed our focus to concentrate on products that are good for clients in this environment and for the firm and with that strategy in place we have continued to generate solid sales in variable annuities without living benefits as well as our structured products as we have shifted away from annuities with guarantees therefore our sales are down but in line with the industry we also made a shift in protection away from fixed insurance to focus on vul and di products life sales were also down given the climate but again results were in line with the industry based on what weve done to appropriately riskadjust these businesses they continue to generate good earnings stability and solid returns in cash flow as a complement to our other businesses now ill cover asset management as youve seen across the industry markets have impacted asset levels from an equity and fixed income perspective as a global asset manager with sizable presence in europe we were also affected by the appreciation of the sterling and the euro versus the dollar assets under management were down to billion given the equity and fixed income markets and the fx impact ive mentioned more than offsetting the bmo acquisition consistent with what youre seeing in the industry investors have more of a risk off perspective and you have a level of taxloss harvesting taking place based on market depreciation very critically in this environment we are maintaining good investment performance and were continuing to maintain good three five and 10year track records while theres been a lot of volatility over the course of the year over of our funds are above median on an assetweighted basis our shortterm performance has been impacted in some of our fixed income strategies based on the spike in interest rates and in europe some of our equity strategies were impacted because of our quality growth positioning lets turn to flows in the quarter we had outflows of billion that included billion of legacy insurance partner outflows positive flows in institutional were more than offset by the ongoing pressure weve seen in retail in retail overall were in net outflows but it improved a bit from a tougher second quarter for us in the industry we ended the third quarter with lower gross sales and higher redemptions than a year ago given the markets this resulted in billion of net outflows driven by weak conditions in us retail equity outflows remain generally in line with the industry and fixed income results were behind given our product mix in emea the retail flows remained under pressure we did see some improvements in continental europe and overall flows were a bit better than the industry for the quarter ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 turning to global institutional excluding legacy insurance partners net inflows were billion and were seeing fundings get extended given the markets and some asset allocation calls in asset management we expect the environment will remain challenging however we think there will be opportunities as markets settle down over time and interest rates stabilize at the same time weve been very much focused on integrating our bmo emea business and thats going well we continue to make good investments in the business overall ensuring that we have the right focus to move forward in distribution as well as servicing and platform capabilities but we also have a very strong eye towards managing expenses in this market and adjusted for the bmo emea acquisition we brought ga expenses down by and well continue to be very focused there as i look ahead for ameriprise i believe we will continue to be operating in these markets for a while so as you expect from us were very much focused on what we can control that includes continuing our strong engagement with clients and advisors as well as leveraging our investments as we continue to manage our expenses tightly moving forward importantly i feel like the strength of our businesses and the growth of the bank will allow us to navigate these markets very well and generate a consistent level of free cash flow and good returns for our shareholders and whats very important and critical for the firm and what we deliver is the engagement of our people and advisors i feel very good about the team we just conducted our employee and advisor surveys and we continue to see high levels of engagement and satisfaction industryleading and we know how important this is going through a challenging environment to keep our focus on our clients in total i feel really good about the mix of our business the flexibility we have and how were positioned for both the challenges and the opportunities ahead now ill turn it over to walter and then ill take your questions walter s berman executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc thank you as jim said results this quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of the ameriprise value proposition as adjusted eps excluding unlocking increased to in a challenging market environment both management business momentum higher interest rate environment and expense discipline more than offset equity and fixed income market depreciation coupled with significant weakening of the pound and the euro in the quarter we continue to benefit from strong growth in wealth management which represented of adjusted operating earnings in the quarter up from a year ago across the firm we continue to manage expenses tightly relative to the revenue opportunity within each segment as a result weve continued to make investments in the bank and other growth initiatives particularly in wealth management while prudently managing overall firmwide expenses on a yeartodate basis ga expenses are flat excluding bmo we expect that for the year ga will be down ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 our balance sheet fundamentals remained strong despite continued market depreciation in the quarter and we returned million of capital to shareholders for the full year we remain on track to return approximately of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders lets turn to slide assets under management and administration ended the quarter at trillion down while auma benefited from strong client flows and the addition of bmo late last year we experienced significant market impacts equity and fixed markets were down and respectively in addition asset management aum levels were substantially impacted by significant weakening of the pound and the euro with the aum of non us businesses down to approximately of the total overall pretax earnings remained strong in this environment up from last year excluding unlocking with meaningful benefits from interest rates and strong client flows more than offsetting significant negative equity and fixed income markets and foreign exchange impacts that largely occurred in september lets turn to individual segment performance beginning with wealth management on slide wealth management client assets declined to billion as a result of significant market depreciation over the past year partially offset by our strong organic growth total client net flows remained strong at billion up from last year with billion of flows into wrap accounts and billion into nonadvisory accounts specifically certificates and retail brokerage as anticipated in this environment revenue per advisor reached in the quarter up from the prior year ph the firm continued to enhance productivity and business growth on slide you can see wealth management profitability increased in the quarter with the significant benefit from interest rates and strong organic growth exceeding negative impacts from market depreciation and lower transactional activity pretax operating margin reached nearly up over basis points yearoveryear and up basis points sequentially adjusted operating expense declined with distribution expenses down reflecting lower transactional activity and asset balances ga is up in the quarter and up on a yeartodate basis the higherthannormal yearoveryear increase in the third quarter was driven by unusually low prioryear expenses relating to staffing levels and te timing of expenses in the current year and continued expenses associated with higher volumes and continued investments in the bank and other growth initiatives we anticipate that the full year will be in line with the yeartodate growth pace we expect the higher interest rate pattern to drive a substantial and sustainable benefit in the fourth quarter of as well as lets discuss the components in more detail first cash balances remain high at billion this quarter with multiple products available to meet client needs including brokerage cash bank and certificates the majority of our brokerage cash is in working cash accounts for our clients where over half of the balances less than and our client crediting rates are continuously benchmarked and remain competitive as a result we have not experienced cash sorting issues to the extent of others in the industry our certificated products offer another solution for clients looking to ladder their liquidity and garner some additional rate upside in the multiple product offerings second the bank provides flexibility to optimize the benefits from higher rates by investing in highquality longer duration securities creating sustainability of interest earnings ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 our bank reached nearly billion in the quarter up from billion a year ago in we plan to grow the bank to the billion range in the quarter the pickup from investments in the bank is approximately basis points above the spreads from offbalance sheet cash over the past several years our total client cash balances have been consistently to of total client assets this positions us well to capture the opportunity from rising rates and lock in those benefits over the medium term in spread earnings will increase by over million versus the prior year and we expect this trend to continue into lets turn to asset management on slide we are managing the business well through a challenging market total assets under management declined to billion primarily from equity and fixed income market depreciation and unexpected significant negative pound and euro foreign exchange impact as i mentioned the bmo acquisition broadened our geographic diversification with about of the assets in emea however this diversification increased our foreign exchange translation exposure asset management like the industry was in outflows in the quarter continued strength in our global institutional business offset a meaningful portion of retail outflows like others we experienced pressures from global market volatility a risk off investor sentiment and geopolitical strain in emea margin in the quarter declined to which is slightly above our target range of to decline versus last year is attributable to broad market depreciation and foreign exchange impacts given the material market depreciation and foreign currency weakening in september we expect additional margin erosion next quarter on slide you can see asset management financial results reflect the market environment earnings declined to million reflecting doubledigit market depreciation significant foreign exchange weakening and outflows importantly we continue to manage the areas we can control expenses remain well mannered excluding bmo total expenses were down aided by a decline in ga we continue to make marketdriven tradeoffs in discretionary spend and remain committed to managing expenses very tightly in the current revenue environment and the fee rate remained stable in the quarter at basis points lets turn to slide retirement protection solutions continued to deliver stable earnings and free cash flow generation a clear result of our differentiated risk profile pretax adjusted operating earnings excluding unlocking were million in the quarter we completed our annual actuarial assumption update which resulted in an unfavorable pretax impact of million sales in the quarter similar to the industry declined as a result of the volatile market environment as well as management action to discontinue sales of variable annuities with living benefits to reduce the risk profile of the business protection sales remain concentrated in highermargin asset accumulation vul which now represents onethird of total insurance inforce assets annuity sales in the quarter were in lower risk products without guarantees and structured variable annuities these products represent over of our total va account value we have begun to reposition our investment portfolio to capture the interest rate opportunity we have remained short on duration in this portfolio given the low rate environment over the past several years we now have the ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 opportunity to enhance yield by extending asset duration and changing the mix of investments without increasing credit risk now lets move to the balance sheet on slide our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong and our diversified highquality investment portfolio remains well positioned in total the average credit rating of the portfolio is aa with only of the portfolio in below investmentgrade securities despite significant market dislocation in the quarter va hedge effectiveness remained very strong in the quarter at our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable free cash flow contributions from all business segments this supports the consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders even during periods of market depreciation like we experienced this quarter during the quarter we returned million to shareholders and excess capital and holding company liquidity remains strong we are on track to return approximately of the adjusted operating earnings to shareholders in with that well take your questions question and answer section operator thank you well now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions well take our first question from ryan krueger with kbw ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi thanks good morning my first question is could you give an update on your excess capital position and any moving parts on the quarter walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc sure ill take that the number is billion its down million from last quarter and the main drivers on that is the market dislocation and the growth in the bank and the remainder is coming from the unlocking ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you and then separately in retirement protection the earnings are over million this quarter ex unlocking they had previously been running more in the million to million range can you help us think about the run rate earnings in that business going forward and also how that portfolio repositioning will impact that walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i would say that yes it did increase a little but i think the run rate that youre talking about between the million range is certainly one that we anticipate going forward and yes the interest rates well take that up again as we do it because we are reinvesting out as we looked at the portfolio and the opportunities because we ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 basically say shorter duration now were taking advantage as we move out but it will go up but i would say i would start with the million range ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats helpful thank you operator well take our next question from brennan hawken with ubs financial brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning jim and walter thanks for taking my queston id love to start with some of the comments on the bank i believe you indicated that youd be moving about billion in balances in why not accelerate that we saw more than that move in the rate environment is certainly attractive and it seems like a good place to utilize some of that capital so thats number one and then number two when you think about the pledge loan book within the bank are you seeing any change in demand or growth as a result of higher rates where maybe the demand has eased up a bit walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so as it relates to i indicated that the it probably was better to say it was at least ph billion we would add billion next year which obviously well gauge the situation we certainly have the capacity to do more both from the availability of liabilities and capital and we will assess it and the key element associated with that is also the availability of investments that meet our standards both from a quality standpoint and diversification standpoint that wont be a factor in that we feel very comfortable with the balances we have that will be the source of that so i would probably modify and say at least billion brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that clarification and then pledge loans have you seen any shift in demand with higher rates or have those continued to grow walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc indiscernible james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc on the pledge loan side walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc oh the pledge loans im sorry i didnt hear ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc in pledge loans its actually right now its adjusting its markets but its growing steadily and we feel very comfortable with it and from that standpoint total of that is over the billion range the total standpoint with our program so we feel very comfortable with it brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that and then in the wealth business you guys do a great job of returning capital to shareholders and have a long track record there and i think its appreciated but have you considered maybe shifting and having an allocation to growth capital and using some of your excess capital to actually continue to build on the recent success that youve had in adding advisors and generating that really steady net new assets in the midsingle digits and maybe even pushing that a little higher have you considered any of that or is that youre just sort of comfortable with the recruiting approach that youve taken so far james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so were very much focused on continuing to bring in quality recruits we just dont want to associate people to us and have be in a processing platform per se as you can see we have a very good strong client value proposition thats very important thats why we generate good returns good margins good retention of assets we ensure that we have an excellent client experience keeping our client satisfaction really high and we really focus on helping good quality advisors grow their practices and retain and build so were going to continue to look and attract good advisors in were spending a bit more time on bringing in some younger people again and building succession in their practices and helping advisors extend their teams and were also building out our ipi group which is our institutional business and were winning some nice accounts there and growing the advisor for us and were also doing some work on our remote channels and expanding that activity that we think will also be a complement so along those lines we are putting money to work we are investing et cetera so its not so much about the use of capital its more about continuing to drive in the areas that we think we can generate both good returns but more importantly continue to build out against our value proposition brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for the color operator well take our next question from suneet kamath with jefferies suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 great thanks just wanted to go back to the bank if i could i guess in addition to adding more deposits were thinking another lever you guys have is to reinvest some assets that are maturing that the deposits are currently supporting so can you frame maybe how much of those assets are rolling off in and if possible what the yield was on those assets relative to where youre able to invest new money today walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so let me take an approximate its walter approximate because were a short duration if you look at where duration is its a tad over three that you should expect over billion to mature in the year and i dont have the exact numbers on yield but you should imagine that its were going to pick up at least or basis points versus whats maturing but i can have alicia get back to you on that suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc okay thats helpful thanks and then i guess for jim towards as the quarter progressed we were getting quite a few questions on ldi in the uk and whats going on there and what any impact on your uk asset management business there could be so could you maybe frame that out how youre thinking about that as an opportunity or where the risks are just want to make sure that its clear in terms of where your exposure is if possible thanks james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc sure suneet so i think as everyone is aware this is a very large market its over to trillion in the uk depends on the day and its really used by almost all the pension funds there are supported by the regulatory authorities the longterm ph yield in european interest rates you know increased dramatically in september and that resulted in clients having to post additional collateral to maintain their ldi coverage ratios the volatility was something that wasnt necessarily seen in the past it was in the to standard deviation type event which is really abnormal and so that volatility affecting the bond markets interest rates going up et cetera so clients have maintained their ldi positions as you would expect the systems and we think this will normalize over time but they had to post more collateral and then free up some assets to do it this market will come back around in a sense of the stabilization and the reverting back to the mean so we feel like the market will continue to be very important there and the pension funds will continue to utilize that for the way they have to manage their assets going forward to get the returns but we do expect some adjustments in the market going forward some players would have to reduce leverage a bit there may be some more operational adjustments to make sure that the markets can flow a bit more easily as you get these type of dislocations and with us you of course saw an asset level decline meaning from the depreciation of the market but we really havent seen major outflows in any fashion and in fact theres some new business that came in so we feel like this market will recover and we feel like we can still do a good business there and it wont have a significant longterm effect ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc so just to summarize near term more of a kind of aum potentially earnings issue as opposed to anything more significant than that walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes exactly suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc terrific okay thanks guys operator well take our next question from alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great good morning thank you for the question first just around some of the cash dynamics at advice over in advice wealth and kind of how thats trending so clearly great to see deposit betas still very low at this point in the cycle as you look forward i guess how do you think that will progress and part b to that curious if youre seeing any incremental demand from thirdparty bank sweep and whether the spread is starting to improve in that channel as well walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so as far as thirdparty demand certainly we have an extensive program and we do not have an issue on the placement of the funds from that standpoint and we also again and again the bank allows us the capability as i talked about growing and certainly reinvesting more directly with a bank institution as far as the deposit betas look we do a competitive scan each week we certainly evaluate it certainly as rates go up and we look at the competitive elements as you look at the per account compensation or a client crediting rate they will change and im sure they will be going up as it relates because we our main focus is to ensure that our clients are getting appropriate rates that are competitive alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and walter just to make sure that i understood the are you saying youre seeing an improvement in demand from thirdparty bank sweep or no real change in terms of what weve seen over ph the last couple months ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i would say this is a healthy environment but its a healthier environment than certainly we saw back a couple of months ago from that standpoint absolutely alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it understood and then jim one for you theres been a couple of articles talking about some potential asset management platforms for sale in the past you guys have obviously been very opportunistic when i kind of think about the columbia acquisition from bank of america as the environment gets potentially or remains i guess kind of dicey here how do you think about opportunities for incremental ma for ameriprise on the asset management side of the house james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so again i think the market is going through a level of dislocation right now and some pressure from as you can see depreciation of the market and flows we are very much focused on really the business that we have right now were integrating the bmo in international and thats going well and thats consuming some time and attention at the same time we know that this is a time for us to really engage our clients and maintain it and we have a lot of good new stuff going on in some of the areas and disciplines that weve been investing in from esg to some of the institutional and ocio and et cetera et cetera and some alternatives so we feel good about the hand we dont know that down the road if theres more significant dislocation and it makes some sense maybe well play but right now its not something we have on the plate alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thank you guys operator well take our next question from andrew kligerman with credit suisse andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc hey good morning maybe staying on the topic of ma but on the divestiture end the markets been pretty volatile and just in general block transactions of insurance assets have not been as robust as we would have thought and i had some optimism that maybe ameriprise would do some transactions could you give a little color on the types of talks youre having about longterm care variable annuities and life insurance blocks respectively and the potential to divest james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc sure andrew so as you as we said we wanted to survey the markets see potential and what the opportunity may be just to evaluate and in so doing what we found most importantly is that there arent a lot of market participants that have transacted are interested in more what i would call highquality books in a sense theyve been much more focused on general count assets so that they can invest with using their various structures and ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 capital situations so we dont think the market has sufficiently evolved to look at the type of business that we have and the type of value that we realize from that business and so at this juncture we actually feel very good about holding business we actually derisk the business tremendously we moved out of a lot of types of businesses that have a bit more of that both volatility or longterm tail our mix of business including our variable annuities without living benefits is a significant part of our portfolio the other portfolio with the living benefits thats closed at this point was actually done in the right way with the right benefits and the right hedging and so we get good cash flow from these businesses and good stability i think you even saw in the current quarter this has been a nice stability for us as you get depreciating markets on the equity side and now walters able to even invest out longer and get higher yields on the book which is good in our longterm care book you can see the quality of that even over the current years and a number of years and so here again there might be some opportunities as people start to get more informed on this over time that well see and i think were starting to but i think at this juncture were very comfortable with the hand we have what were doing the type of businesses we maintain and type of businesses we invest in and the type of businesses that we move and handle the book to manage and so we actually think its a great complement particularly in an environment like this andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thats really helpful and jim maybe just shifting over to asset management per the presentations clearly in retail the three five and 10year numbers are excellent versus peers but the oneyear numbers seem to have deteriorated in both retail equity and retail fixed income could you kind of give a little color on why those figures have deteriorated versus peers and strategically what you might do to turn around that performance james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so again good question and i think we mentioned at a little higher level so let me dig a little deeper for you so overall and across our portfolios even for the one year theyre very good there are a few pockets that where we have some underperformance but its not by a lot that really brings the averages down so some of thats in our fixed income so in some of the longer duration because of the rise the spike in interest rates as quickly our teams were much more focused on the credit side and so the duration was a bit longer and so that impact now that will come and reverse around as we get further out where the yield will be good et cetera but i would probably say thats where weve gotten some of the impact not on the shorter duration on the longer and then the second part is in europe and its not because of underperformance its because in europe when they have equities they dont break their benchmark into value versus growth et cetera and so we have more growth qualityoriented portfolios and as you would understand value has performed a bit better in this market even though its down its been down less than growthoriented and so those as benchmarks underperformed the benchmark but our clients there understand that thats why they invested in the portfolios and they know and feel good about what that is over the longer term but on a benchmark basis thats why you got the underperformance ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc makes a lot of sense thank you operator well take our next question from craig siegenthaler with bank of america craig siegenthaler q analyst bank of america thanks good morning everyone my question is on brokerage cash sorting how do you expect sorting activity to trend over the next six to months and what do you see as the direct impact to both money market fund aum and cash balances james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so let me start and if walter wants to complement so we already have an in what youve seen in the growth of our cash theres already had the cash cash sorting occurring so the growth of cash itself if you call it in a larger category is higher than our billion because money has gone into money markets and they have gone into shorter duration funds and some brokered activities and so with the growth that we have this is more of the continuation of the growth thats more in the transactional held for cash or in our certificate programs and so we saw some of that cash sorting occur in the third quarter as you said we may see some more of it but ties of the cash has grown because people have moved money to the sidelines walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc the only thing i would add there is i think as i think alicia said yesterday over of this transitional working cash is less than or and less so its stickiness is there and certainly we are competitive in what we do so i think the sorting is less of an issue for us from that standpoint because in the higher tiers we are competitive and we constantly evaluate like i said weekly to ensure that that stays so its a different model that we have and i think its demonstrating its stickiness craig siegenthaler q analyst bank of america thank you walter then sticking with brokerage cash what are your longerterm targets for both off balance sheet cash and then on balance sheet cash inside of the bank and im thinking when you reach more of an equilibrium and your cash mix is post the bulk transfer effort walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so let me take a shot listen obviously we have a growing situation certainly with getting additional cash from our current clients and new areas coming in so we think we see that as growing from that standpoint and we will gauge it as obviously the impact of looking at alternatives because it is again transitional on where its going to go but that is something from a directional standpoint very sticky and we do see certainly potential to grow ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 but we will then look for as i indicated the ability to redeploy in our multiple strategies to ensure the stability of our earnings that we have both in garnering the higher yield with the certainly the high the lowrisk profile that we do and to ensure that so i would say that youll see the percentage going over the bank increasing as we progress as we feel confident but its all situationally driven and thats why i said when i said in my talk points billion is probably at least billion because we do see in this case but we reevaluate that theres a substantial opportunity to use the bank not just for the investments were talking about to grow the capabilities that we have to meet our clients needs also with deposit products and other products that theyre developing at this stage james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah well be launching a number of deposit products in the bank starting in the first quarter and then high yielding type of deposits and other things that you see in some of the other types of institutions later in the year so we feel theres an opportunity to not just transfer money in but to actually grow the deposit base craig siegenthaler q analyst bank of america thank you operator take our next question from kenneth lee with rbc capital markets kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi thanks for taking my questions and good morning just one on the asset management business in terms of the margins obviously above the target range this past quarter wondering if theres any specific factors driving that any potential benefits that are nonrecurring and in terms of the outlook for margins you mentioned potential erosion based on fx just wondering if you could just further expand that thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so on the margins as you saw certainly as it relates to the markets that we looked at last year theyre running there in the and we mentioned that were certainly getting the benefits from the market appreciation that was taking place and now youre seeing from that standpoint weve already absorbed the lower margin as we indicated to that associated with the bmo business which is the nature of the business so this range is above slightly above our target of to thats been impacted by the markets primarily theres no abnormalities that we see other than the foreign exchange and the other things that have impacted that but as ill mention the market basically depreciation substantially took place in the september timeframe so you will see a carryover of that into the fourth quarter but that will be a marketdriven situation well probably move it to the lower end of the range james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and foreign exchange we have of our assets as you know a year ago with the bmo acquisition in europe and the uk and you can see the size of that depreciation of the pound and the euro and that had a sizable effect now hopefully that will stabilize in over time because the dollars so strong maybe start to come back in ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 a fashion that would be a positive but the combination of that and depreciating markets have really squeezed that a bit kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc got you very helpful and just one followup if i may just on the annual actuarial review wondering if you could just share with us some of the key assumption changes driving most of the impact thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well okay the key elements that drove it from the actuarial element was that we adjusted our mortality tables and from the standpoint of we look at our experience and so that was one and then we also saw lower lapses coming in and therefore extending our living benefits ph going those that are primary all again nothing out of pattern it was just that was the trendline james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and we did not adjust our interest rates where we had lowered them a year ago and you can see the rise in interest rates walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah good point kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc got you very helpful thanks again operator well take our next question from tom gallagher with evercore isi thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi good morning first question is just how do you think about the roi difference right now between the build in bank versus the benefit of share repurchase thinking about how much youve grown the size of that bank and the capital thats been used to build that up i assume those are pretty high roes but just curious if you can give some perspective on what level roe roi however you want to describe it and how that would compare to the return you get from share repurchase walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well its interesting because listen i think as you look at the amount of free cash flow we generate and the amount of excess capital we have and our ability to does not inhibit in any manner shape or form our ability to continue to grow and invest in our bank to garner the benefits of both and we constantly are making that evaluation assessing our excess as it is the situation and the generation that we have so i would say the return to the bank are certainly getting to very respectful levels ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 and the buyback from that standpoint is an element that we look at certainly our excess looking at the opportunity to return to shareholders and then other opportunities but one of the things that we constantly do is the ability we are not basically ph stopping or reducing our impact of investing in the business and that is a key to us so i would say theyre not mutually exclusive we kind of james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc no and i think youll also find that the bank now will become a nice complement and its not just for what it is today but strategically it will actually help us expand our relationships deepen them with clients offer a lot of other products thats situational for the wealth business and so we actually think its a great diversifier and a great complement and that capital that were deploying well get a very good return on it thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thanks and then just to followup on the whole cash benefit that you would still expect to see heading into i just want to make sure im thinking about this correctly or at least directionally correctly if i add look at the billion allin of balances and listen to everything youve said so far on the revenue side i can and im going to compare it to the run rate you had in to then where they should go to in but on the revenue side i can get somewhere in the million to million pretax earnings revenue pickup headed into but then its a little less clear to me how much of a give up you would expect to have on cost of crediting whether thats and any so walter curious if you can give me some idea whether im in the right directional place on the revenue pickup and then also on credit walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc im not going to get into the forecasting tom im not going to get into the forecast i will say as you see what the trendlines are and certainly the elements of potential rate increases and the balances we have but theres a lot of variables that go into it but certainly we have a very very strong trendline as we certainly go into the fourth quarter and going into and we feel with the complement of both the short cash coming out of the sweep accounts and the investments there and the spreads that were picking up in the bank you can imagine it is going to be a positive trend as we move into the fourth and first in thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay and walter sorry just a follow up on that anything you can offer it doesnt look like youve had to give much up on cost of crediting so far any sense for how that might change do you think thats still going to be a fairly low impact or do you think that that might move up materially james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc i would say this what were saying is there is an increase in crediting rates and there will be as rates continue to be persistent or go up we will make adjustments again based on size of account and whether its really a transactional or not and keeping the cash ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 but as walter said some of that could be will be offset based on some of the rollover in assets we have in the bank and how to invest as well as what we transfer but also theres a question is the fed going to continue to raise rates i mean its pretty much we think is going to go up again i know theres a lot of things that the fed is going to pull back next year but with inflation so persistent im not sure thats the case and if it is we have the ability to invest out so i think were feeling very good that what we get from the bank what we get from the overall business will offset the appreciating markets and give us a nice complement here thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thanks operator well take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning so wanted to start off with a question just on the organic growth drivers in awm the organic growth certainly a good result given the ph choppy tape it looks like you recorded some wins in the financial institutions channel during the quarter how material were some of those wins from an ma perspective and could you help frame the organic growth opportunity that you envisage within that channel james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so we are getting some nice wins and we actually have a good pipeline of even some largersize types of deals arrangements excuse me and as those deals occur the assets usually follow so in that sense you have that pipeline that occurs and then you bring on the advisors et cetera to help grow those channels so we feel it will be a nice growth business for us again based on the size and scale compared to our other businesses its not of the scale yet but we think this will grow in scale over time and so we feel very good about it we dont break out information yet thatll be something well look at down the road steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it and just a followup on the earlier discussion relating to cash sorting you noted that youve seen some better cash sorting trends relative to peers some of your peers also alluded to a benefit from heavy selling activity in september i was hoping you can just give an update on what youre seeing in terms of cash balance trends or levels in october and maybe a little bit more specificity just in terms of where you expect cash balances to settle out once we reach whether its terminal fed funds or just peak sorting activity across the complex james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 the only thing i mean the way i would position it to you is weve always had a certain level that is held in our cash based on how we do asset allocation how we have it for clients liquidity needs an emergency or even for cash to reinvest in and balances that ability to allocate and so if you assume thats the case you can look at it that way of course cash has built up a bit more and we saw that and thats why i said theres a complement to cash above what were holding that have gone into some of these other types of money markets and other things and brokerage cds et cetera et cetera so unstructured so i would probably say we are not seeing that there would be a dramatic falloff in the cash that were holding there may be some adjustment because its gone up a bit but we feel very comfortable that within that type of range of percentage to assets because again this is not where people are holding huge amounts of cash just short term they usually our advisors usually invest at one level anyway even if its in a type of cash product or a bond i think over time fixed income will come back that bodes well for our asset management business as well and go to work in our wrap accounts but i still think that that or would be rational as the clients as weve seen over the past steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc helpful color thanks so much for taking my questions operator well take our next question from john barnidge with piper sandler john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you very much appreciate it can you talk about your outlook for expense reductions in asset management with the bmo acquisition now coming up on a full year i know the oneyear rule is important for european regulators james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc the synergies from the bmo acquisition walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc the synergies james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc synergies from walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc synergies are right now are actually on track as we talked about we gave in our when we announced we are tracking on synergies obviously from that standpoint the synergies between us are what ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc for next year as well james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc for thats where i would say the bulk of these synergies will be achieved as we go and well also then complete most of our transition expense activities as related to it and so were on track and were performing well walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc and most of what you saw in the reduction in expenses wasnt necessarily from synergies yet in the current periods so thats more of tightening up our expenses as we go in and the team is doing a good job of rationalizing what that is and well look to maintain control of those expenses we are still making nice investments in asset management but i think the synergies will be helpful as well as we go in that will offset some of the compression that were seeing in the european markets john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you and then my followup question ph do you feel mortality is the best strongest or healthiest in 3qs annually did that precovid cadence to mortality trends return for the retirement protection solutions life business thank you walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so if youre talking the mortality table that we addressed it in the second john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co no im just talking indiscernible walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc the mortality in our normal life business again mortality in the life is were using basically industry tables right now and we are basically seeing that our trends are totally consistent with the industry tables that weve been that are out there john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you operator our last question will come from erik bass with autonomous research ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 erik bass q analyst autonomous research hi thank you maybe for wealth management just trying to put it all together it doesnt sound like theres anything unusual that benefited margins this quarter and youll still expect to see some benefits from interest rates going forward so do you see a margin in the range as sustainable near term and something that could potentially even move higher if markets stabilize walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i would say listen our margin in the base business are increasing but really we are getting the lift from the interest rates and that is an important contributor and certainly we do see margins from those activities being larger elements as you look at the bank and you look at the ph sweep cash so yes the answer is yes we do see the margins will be increasing based upon the current assumptions that we see erik bass q analyst autonomous research thank you and then i guess last thing just on the new advisor recruiting outlook can you just talk about how market conditions are affecting your ability to recruit advisors because it was a good quarter this quarter but i know things sort of happen on a lag so are you seeing any change in the pipeline james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc no we see a good pipeline we are maintaining sort of our focus on that and the areas of levels that youve been seeing i think we are finally breaking through as far as what advisors understand about our business i mean when we compare what we do our capabilities our technology et cetera i think advisors are very impressed and we get very good compliments i mean nine times out of our advisors join us say that our capabilities technology support is way beneficial from the firms that they joined us from whether they be the independents or ph the wires et cetera so we feel very good about what that is as long as we have the conversations erik bass q analyst autonomous research perfect thank you operator and that does conclude todays presentation thank you for your participation and you may now
