international ltd ameriprise holdings inc ameriprise asset management holdings singapore ltd total table end in riversource life established an agreement to protect its exposure to genworth life insurance company glic for its reinsured ltc in substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized the terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared in the normal course of regular reviews with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies glic is domiciled in delaware so in the event glic were subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings such proceedings would be located in and governed by delaware laws delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs as well as contracts among sophisticated parties similar credit protections to what we have with glic have been tested and respected in delaware and elsewhere in the united states and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that glic becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in delaware accordingly while no credit protections are perfect we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our counterparty credit exposure to glic is not the full amount of the gross liability that glic reinsures but a much smaller net exposure to glic if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections thus management believes that our agreement and offsetting nonltc legacy arrangements with genworth will enable riversource life to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of glic dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases we paid
