item risk factors the discussion below addresses the material factors of which we are currently aware that could affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition however other factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also adversely affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition therefore the risk factors below should not be considered all of the potential risks that we may face for more information on how we manage risks see managing risk in the mda on page for more information about the risks contained in the risk factors section see item business on page mda on page and notes to consolidated financial statements on page coronavirus disease the effects of the pandemic have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our businesses and results of operations and its duration and future impacts on the economy and our businesses results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain the negative economic conditions arising from the pandemic negatively impacted our financial results during in various respects including contributing to increases in our allowance and provision for credit losses and noninterest expense these negative economic conditions may have a continued adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations which could include decreased demand for and use of our products and services protracted periods of historically low interest rates lower fees including asset management fees lower sales and trading revenue due to decreased market liquidity resulting from heightened volatility higher levels of uncollectible reversed charges in our merchant services business increased noninterest expense including operational losses and increased credit losses due to our customers and clients inability to fulfill contractual obligations and deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers which may vary by region sector or industry that may increase our provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs our provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs may also continue to be impacted by volatility in the energy and commodity markets additionally our liquidity andor regulatory capital could be adversely impacted by customers withdrawal of deposits volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets volatility in foreign exchange rates and customer draws on lines of credit continued adverse macroeconomic conditions could also result in potential downgrades to our credit ratings negative impacts to regulatory capital and liquidity and further restrictions on dividends andor common stock repurchases if we become unable to operate our businesses from remote locations including for example because of an internal or external failure of our information technology infrastructure we experience increased rates of employee illness or unavailability or governmental restrictions are placed on our employees or operations this could adversely affect our business continuity status and result in disruption to our businesses additionally we rely on third parties who could experience adverse effects on their business continuity and business interruptions which could increase our risks and adversely impact our businesses there can be no assurance that current or future governmental fiscal and monetary relief programs will stimulate the global economy or avert negative economic or market conditions our participation in such programs could result in reputational harm and government actions and proceedings and has resulted in and may continue to result in litigation including class actions such actions may result in judgments settlements penalties and fines our participation in such programs has also resulted and may continue to result in operational losses including from the paycheck protection program ppp and processing unemployment insurance we continue to closely monitor the pandemic and related risks as they evolve globally and in the us the magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its future direct and indirect effects on the global economy and our businesses results of operations and financial condition are highly uncertain and depend on future developments that cannot be predicted including the likelihood of further surges of covid19 cases and the spread of more easily communicable variants of covid19 the timing and availability of effective medical treatments and vaccines future actions taken by governmental authorities including additional stimulus legislation andor other third parties in response to the pandemic the pandemic may cause prolonged global or national negative economic conditions or longer lasting effects on economic conditions than currently exist which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations and financial condition market our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the financial markets fiscal monetary and regulatory policies and economic conditions generally general economic political social and health conditions in the us and in one or more countries abroad affect markets in the us and abroad and our business in particular markets in the us or abroad may be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates availability and market conditions of financing unexpected changes in gross domestic product gdp economic growth or its sustainability inflation consumer spending employment levels wage stagnation federal government shutdowns developments related to the federal debt ceiling energy prices home prices bankruptcies a default by a significant market participant fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies liquidity of the global financial markets the growth of global trade and commerce trade policies the availability and cost of capital and credit disruption of communication transportation or energy infrastructure and investor sentiment and confidence additionally global markets including energy and commodity markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change extreme weather events or natural disasters the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics cyber attacks or campaigns military conflict terrorism or other geopolitical events market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and affect our business liquidity also any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the us or abroad as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including capital and liquidity levels for example the global markets including the energy and commodity markets experienced significant volatility and disruption as a result of the uncertainty and economic impact of the pandemic further uncertainty and ongoing developments in connection with the pandemic including its further spread changing consumer and business behaviors government restrictions in an effort to control the virus and timing and availability of effective medical treatments and vaccines could table start bank of america table end result in further market volatility and disruptions globally and continue to adversely impact macroeconomic conditions actions taken by the federal reserve including changes in its target funds rate balance sheet management and lending facilities and other central banks are beyond our control and difficult to predict these actions can affect interest rates and the value of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities and impact our borrowers the continued protracted period of lower interest rates has resulted in lower revenue through lower net interest income which has adversely affected our results of operations additional periods of lower interest rates or a move to negative interest rates in the us could have a further adverse impact on our net interest income and results of operations uncertainty or ongoing developments in connection with the uks exit from the eu and the resulting impact on the financial markets and regulations in relevant jurisdictions could negatively impact our revenues and ongoing operations in europe and other jurisdictions changes to existing us laws and regulatory policies including those related to financial regulation taxation international trade fiscal policy and healthcare may adversely impact us or global economic activity and our customers our counterparties and our earnings and operations for example additional fiscal stimulus and rising debt levels in the us and abroad in response to the ongoing pandemic could affect macroeconomic conditions market liquidity conditions and interest rates significant fiscal policy changes andor initiatives including as a result of the change in the us presidential administration and congress may also increase uncertainty surrounding the formulation and direction of us monetary policy and volatility of interest rates higher us interest rates relative to other major economies could increase the likelihood of a more volatile and appreciating us dollar changes or proposed changes to certain us trade and international investment policies particularly with important trading partners including china and the eu have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact financial markets disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation including through the use of tariffs foreign exchange measures or the largescale sale of us treasury bonds further the use of tariffs among countries not directly involving the us could spread and could damage our customers directly and indirectly any of these developments could adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses our customers our securities and derivatives portfolios including the risk of lower reinvestment rates within those portfolios our level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses the carrying value of our deferred tax assets our capital levels our liquidity and our results of operations additionally the uncertainty related to the transition from interbank offered rates ibors and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates arrs could negatively impact markets globally and our business andor magnify any negative impact of the above referenced factors on our business customers and results of operations increased market volatility and adverse changes in financial or capital market conditions may increase our market risk our liquidity competitive position business results of operations and financial condition are affected by market risks such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates fluctuations in equity and futures prices lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products the implied volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and other economic and business factors these market risks may adversely affect among other things the value of our on and offbalance sheet securities trading assets and other financial instruments the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets the value of assets under management aum fee income relating to aum customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives the volume of client activity in our trading operations investment banking fees the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage and our competitiveness with respect to deposit pricing for example the value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates if the federal reserve or a nonus central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy market interest rates could be affected which could adversely impact the value of such assets changes to fiscal policy including rapid expansion of us federal deficit spending and resultant debt issuance could also affect market interest rates in addition the low interest rate environment and a flat or inverted yield curve has had and could continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations including on future revenue and earnings growth we use various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures but those are subject to inherent limitations in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated and vice versa these types of market movements may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses these changes in correlation can be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours in these and other cases it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets to the extent that we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions we may incur losses if the value of assets decline including due to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds we have a large portfolio of financial instruments including loans and loan commitments securities financing agreements assetbacked secured financings derivative assets and liabilities debt securities marketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value that are subject to valuation and impairment assessments we determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance which for financial instruments measured at fair value requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements the fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity credit quality funding impact on certain derivatives and other transactionspecific factors where appropriate gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of operations unless we have effectively hedged our exposures increases in interest rates may result in a decrease in residential mortgage loan originations in addition increases in interest rates may adversely impact the fair value of debt securities and accordingly for debt securities classified as available for sale may adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and thus capital levels decreases in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds of certain assets and therefore may adversely affect net interest income fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market table start bank of america table end transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions or indices the financial strength of counterparties with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets also will affect the fair value of these assets sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets which may make it difficult to sell hedge or value these assets the inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our riskweighted assets rwa which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs values of aum also impact revenues in our wealth management and related advisory businesses for assetbased management and performance fees declines in values of aum can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets liquidity if we are unable to access the capital markets or continue to maintain deposits or our borrowing costs increase our liquidity and competitive position will be negatively affected liquidity is essential to our businesses we fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets we rely on certain secured funding sources such as repo markets which are typically shortterm and creditsensitive in nature we also engage in asset securitization transactions including with the governmentsponsored enterprises gses to fund consumer lending activities our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements including as a result of credit concerns for shortterm borrowing changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile prolonged federal government shutdowns or changes in regulations guidance or gse status that impact our funding avenues or ability to access certain funding sources additionally our liquidity may be negatively impacted by the unwillingness or inability of the federal reserve to act as lender of last resort unexpected simultaneous draws on lines of credit slower customer payment rates restricted access to the assets of prime brokerage clients the withdrawal of or failure to attract customer deposits or invested funds which could result from customer attrition for higher yields the desire for more conservative alternatives or our customers increased need for cash increased regulatory liquidity capital and margin requirements for our us or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries changes in patterns of intraday liquidity usage resulting from a counterparty or technology failure or other idiosyncratic event or failure or default by a significant market participant or third party including clearing agents custodians or central counterparties ccps these factors also have the potential to increase our borrowing costs several of these factors may arise due to circumstances beyond our control such as general market volatility disruption shock or stress the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics federal reserve policy decisions including fluctuations in interest rates or federal reserve balance sheet composition negative views about the corporation including short and longterm business prospects or the financial services industry generally or due to a specific news event changes in the regulatory environment or governmental fiscal or monetary policies including as a result of the change in the us presidential administration and congress actions by credit rating agencies or an operational problem that affects third parties or us the impact of these events whether within our control or not could include an inability to sell assets or redeem investments unforeseen outflows of cash the need to draw on liquidity facilities the reduction of financing balances and the loss of equity secured funding debt repurchases to support the secondary market or meet client requests the need for additional funding for commitments and contingencies and unexpected collateral calls among other things the result of which could be increased costs a liquidity shortfall andor impact on our liquidity coverage ratio our liquidity and cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing market conditions including changes in interest and currency exchange rates fluctuations in equity and futures prices lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products and our credit spreads credit spreads are the amount in excess of the interest rate of us treasury securities or other benchmark securities of a similar maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can increase the cost of our funding and result in marktomarket or credit valuation adjustment exposures changes in our credit spreads are marketdriven and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile we may also experience spread compression as a result of offering higher than expected deposit rates in order to attract and maintain deposits due to increased marketplace rate competition additionally concentrations within our funding profile such as maturities currencies or counterparties can reduce our funding efficiency reduction in our credit ratings could significantly limit our access to funding or the capital markets increase borrowing costs or trigger additional collateral or funding requirements our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings in addition credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and seek to engage in certain transactions including otc derivatives credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and asset securitizations our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies which consider a number of factors including our financial strength performance prospects and operations and factors not under our control such as the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment including the macroeconomic stress caused by the pandemic rating agencies could make adjustments to our credit ratings at any time and there can be no assurance as to when and whether downgrades will occur a reduction in certain of our credit ratings could result in a wider credit spread and negatively affect our liquidity access to credit markets the related cost of funds our businesses and certain trading revenues particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical if the shortterm credit ratings of our parent company or bank or brokerdealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels we may suffer the potential loss of access to shortterm funding sources such as repo financing andor incur increased cost of funds and increased collateral requirements under the terms of certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements if our or our subsidiaries credit ratings are downgraded the counterparties may require additional collateral or terminate these contracts or agreements table start bank of america table end while certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable the full consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a financial institution are inherently uncertain as they depend upon numerous dynamic complex and interrelated factors and assumptions including whether any downgrade of a firms longterm credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its shortterm credit ratings and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers investors and counterparties bank of america corporation is a holding company is dependent on its subsidiaries for liquidity and may be restricted from transferring funds from subsidiaries bank of america corporation as the parent company is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries we evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal regulatory contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another including the parent company which could result in adverse liquidity events the parent company depends on dividends distributions loans and other payments from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations including debt obligations any inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make payments to us may adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition many of our subsidiaries including our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses intercompany arrangements we entered into in connection with our resolution planning submissions could restrict the amount of funding available to the parent company from our subsidiaries under certain adverse conditions additional restrictions on related party transactions increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts as well as lower earnings can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of the parent company and even require the parent company to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries also regulatory action that requires additional liquidity at each of our subsidiaries could impede access to funds we need to pay our obligations or pay dividends in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors our liquidity and financial condition and the ability to pay dividends to shareholders and to pay obligations could be materially adversely affected in the event of a resolution bank of america corporation our parent holding company is required to periodically submit a plan to the fdic and federal reserve describing its resolution strategy under the us bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure in the current plan bank of america corporations preferred resolution strategy is a single point of entry strategy this strategy provides that only the parent holding company files for resolution under the us bankruptcy code and contemplates providing certain key operating subsidiaries with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress and to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy of the parent holding company bank of america corporation has entered into intercompany arrangements resulting in the contribution of most of its capital and liquidity to key subsidiaries pursuant to these arrangements if bank of america corporations liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes imminent bank of america corporation will no longer be able to draw liquidity from its key subsidiaries and will be required to contribute its remaining financial assets to a whollyowned holding company subsidiary which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the ability to return capital to shareholders including through the payment of dividends and repurchase of the corporations common stock and meet our payment obligations if the fdic and federal reserve jointly determine that bank of america corporations resolution plan is not credible they could impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations we could also be required to take certain actions that could impose operating costs and could potentially result in the divestiture or restructuring of businesses and subsidiaries additionally under the financial reform act when a gsib such as bank of america corporation is in default or danger of default the fdic may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution in the event of such appointment the fdic could among other things invoke the orderly liquidation authority instead of the us bankruptcy code if the secretary of the treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations in the fdic issued a notice describing its preferred single point of entry strategy for resolving a gsib under this approach the fdic could replace bank of america corporation with a bridge holding company which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank but whose equity would be held solely for the benefit of our creditors the fdics single point of entry strategy may result in our security holders suffering greater losses than would have been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy credit economic or market disruptions and insufficient credit loss reserves may result in a higher provision for credit losses a number of our products expose us to credit risk including loans letters of credit derivatives debt securities trading account assets and assets heldforsale deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers counterparties or underlying collateral could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our credit portfolios may be impacted by global and us macroeconomic and market conditions events and disruptions including sustained weakness in gdp consumerspending declines property value declines or assetprice corrections increasing consumer and corporate leverage increases in corporate bond spreads rising or elevated unemployment levels fluctuations in foreign exchange or interest rates widespread health emergencies or pandemics extreme weather events and the impacts of climate change and domestic and global efforts to transition to a lowcarbon economy significant economic or market stresses and disruptions typically have a negative impact on the business environment and financial markets property value declines or assetprice corrections could increase the risk of borrowers or counterparties defaulting or becoming delinquent in their obligations to us which could increase credit losses simultaneous drawdowns on lines of credit andor an increase in a borrowers leverage in a table start bank of america table end weakening economic environment could result in deterioration in our credit portfolio should borrowers be unable to fulfill competing financial obligations credit portfolio deterioration could also be magnified by lending to leveraged borrowers elevated asset prices or declining property or collateral values unrelated to macroeconomic stress increased delinquency and default rates could adversely affect our consumer credit card home equity and residential mortgage portfolios through increased chargeoffs and provision for credit losses beginning in the first quarter of the pandemic resulted in changes to consumer and business behaviors and restrictions on economic activity which have negatively impacted the global economy and could continue to negatively impact our consumer and commercial credit portfolios accordingly we increased our allowance for credit losses as a result of the expected macroeconomic impact of covid19 which has adversely affected our results of operations although the economy including gdp and unemployment have improved since the first half of certain sectors remain significantly impacted eg hospitality entertainment and travel as covid19 cases have surged in the fourth quarter of and early compared to earlier levels and restrictions on economic activity have been reintroduced in certain geographies there remains significant uncertainty on what the ultimate impact the pandemic will have on the economy and our allowance for credit losses we establish an allowance for credit losses which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments based on managements best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the corporations relevant financial assets the process to determine the allowance requires us to make difficult and complex judgments including forecasting how borrowers will perform in changing and unprecedented economic conditions and predicting developments in public health and fiscal policy related to the pandemic the ability of our borrowers or counterparties to repay their obligations will likely be impacted by changes in future economic conditions which in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates there is also the possibility that we have failed or will fail to accurately identify the appropriate economic indicators or accurately estimate their impacts to our borrowers which similarly could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates we may suffer unexpected losses if the models and assumptions we use to establish reserves or the judgments we make in extending credit to our borrowers or counterparties which are more sensitive due to the uncertainty regarding the magnitude and duration of the pandemic and related macroeconomic impact prove inaccurate in predicting future events in addition changes to external factors can negatively impact our recognition of credit losses in our portfolios and allowance for credit losses as of january we implemented a new accounting standard to estimate our allowance for credit losses although we believe that the allowance for credit losses is in compliance with the new accounting standard there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to address credit losses particularly if the economic outlook deteriorates significantly in such an event we may increase our allowance which would reduce our earnings additionally to the extent that economic conditions worsen as a result of covid19 or otherwise impacting our consumer and commercial borrowers counterparties or underlying collateral and credit losses are worse than expected we may further increase our provision for credit losses which could have a further adverse effect on our results of operations and could negatively impact our financial condition our concentrations of credit risk could adversely affect our credit losses results of operations and financial condition in the ordinary course of our business we may be subject to concentrations of credit risk because of a common characteristic or common sensitivity to economic financial public health or business developments for example concentrations in credit risk may result in a particular industry geography product asset class counterparty individual exposure or within any pool of exposures with a common risk characteristic a deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry geographic location product or asset class or a failure or downgrade of or default by any particular entity or group of entities could negatively affect our businesses and it is possible our limits and credit monitoring exposure controls will not function as anticipated while our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokerdealers commercial banks investment banks insurers mutual funds and hedge funds central counterparties and other institutional clients resulting in significant credit concentration with respect to this industry financial services institutions and other counterparties are interrelated because of trading funding clearing or other relationships as a result defaults by one or more counterparties or market uncertainty about the financial stability of one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally could lead to marketwide liquidity disruptions losses and defaults many of these transactions expose us to credit risk and in some cases disputes and litigation in the event of default of a counterparty in addition our credit risk may be heightened by market risk when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due to us which may occur as a result of fraud or other events that impact the value of the collateral further disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and we could suffer losses during such periods if we are unable to realize the fair value of the collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral our commercial portfolios include exposures to certain industries including asset managers and funds real estate capital goods and finance companies economic weaknesses adverse business conditions market disruptions rising interest or capitalization rates the collapse of speculative bubbles greater volatility in areas where we have concentrated credit risk or deterioration in real estate values or household incomes may cause us to experience a decrease in cash flow and higher credit losses in either our consumer or commercial portfolios or cause us to write down the value of certain assets additionally we could experience continued and longterm negative impact to our commercial credit exposure and an increase in credit losses within those industries that continue to be disproportionately impacted by covid19 or are permanently impacted by a change in consumer preferences resulting from covid19 including hospitality entertainment and travel furthermore we have concentrations of credit risk with respect to our consumer real estate auto consumer credit card and commercial real estate portfolios which represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio decreases in home price valuations or commercial real estate valuations in certain markets where we have large concentrations as well as table start bank of america table end more broadly within the us or globally could result in increased defaults delinquencies or credit loss in particular the impact of climate change such as rising average global temperatures and rising sea levels and the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters such as droughts floods wildfires and hurricanes could negatively impact collateral the valuations of home prices or commercial real estate or our customers ability andor willingness to pay outstanding loans this could also cause insurability risk andor increased insurance costs to customers we also enter into transactions with sovereign nations us states and municipalities unfavorable economic or political conditions disruptions to capital markets currency fluctuations changes in oil prices social instability and changes in government or monetary policies could adversely impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of these government entities and expose us to credit risk liquidity disruptions in the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of our positions leading to increased concentrations which could increase the credit and market risk associated with our positions as well as increase our rwa we may be adversely affected if the us housing market weakens or home prices decline us home prices continued to generally remain stable or increase in supported by singlefamily housing demand and low interest rates however changes in business and household behaviors and restrictions on activity in response to the pandemic have had a negative impact on some property markets particularly in highdensity urban areas we remain conscious of geographic markets where housing price growth has slowed or decreased or is vulnerable to lasting shifts in demand due to the pandemic as further declines in future periods may negatively impact the demand for many of our products additionally our mortgage loan production volume is generally influenced by the rate of growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the residential mortgage market both of which may be adversely affected by rising interest rates conditions in the us housing market during the financial crisis resulted in both significant writedowns of asset values in several asset classes notably mortgagebacked securities and exposure to monolines if the us housing market were to weaken the value of real estate could decline which could result in increased credit losses and delinquent servicing expenses and negatively affect our representations and warranties exposures and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks and potential losses we are party to a large number of derivatives transactions that may expose us to unexpected market credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses severe declines in asset values unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account or anticipated in the development structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events such as a change in the credit rating of the corporation or one or more of its affiliates we may be required to provide additional collateral or take other remedial actions and could experience increased difficulty obtaining funding or hedging risks in some cases our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements we are also a member of various central counterparties ccps in part due to regulatory requirements for mandatory clearing of derivative transactions which potentially increases our credit risk exposures to ccps in the event that one or more members of the ccp defaults on its obligations we may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the ccp as a result of that default a ccp may modify in its discretion the margin we are required to post which could mean unexpected and increased exposure to the ccp as a clearing member we are exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our clients for which we clear transactions which may not be covered by available collateral additionally default by a significant market participant may result in further risk and potential losses geopolitical we are subject to numerous political economic market reputational operational legal regulatory and other risks in the jurisdictions in which we operate we do business throughout the world including in emerging markets economic or geopolitical stress in one or more countries could have a negative impact regionally or globally resulting in among other things market volatility reduced market value and economic output our businesses and revenues derived from nonus jurisdictions are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations financial social or judicial instability changes in government leadership including as a result of electoral outcomes or otherwise changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization andor confiscation of assets price controls high inflation natural disasters the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics capital controls currency redenomination risk exchange controls unfavorable political and diplomatic developments oil price fluctuations and changes in legislation these risks are especially elevated in emerging markets additionally protectionist trade policies and continued trade tensions between the us and important trading partners particularly china and the eu including the risk that tariffs continue to rise and other restrictive actions on crossborder trade investment and transfer of information technology are taken that weigh heavily on regional trade volumes and domestic demand through falling business sentiment and lower consumer confidence could adversely affect our businesses and revenues as well as our customers and counterparties elevated tensions between the us and china also raise the risk that current or future us sanctions against individuals or export controls targeting chinese firms could prompt retaliatory responses potentially impacting our operations and revenue additionally the realization of any significant geopolitical events negative market conditions andor change in market dynamics as a result of the uks exit from the eu could adversely impact our businesses the short and longterm impact of the uks exit from the eu on european and global macroeconomic conditions our business operations and results of operations remain unknown a number of nonus jurisdictions in which we do business have been or may be negatively impacted by slowing growth or recessionary conditions market volatility andor political or civil unrest the ongoing pandemic has had a severe negative impact on global gdp and the global economic environment remains challenging even as output has begun to improve economic weakness may prove persistent in many countries and regions including europe japan and numerous emerging markets potential risks of default on or devaluation of sovereign debt in some nonus jurisdictions could expose us to substantial losses as a result of the pandemic and fiscal policy responses table start bank of america table end to it government debt levels have increased significantly raising the risk of volatility significant valuation changes or default in markets for sovereign debt risks in one nation can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in other nations including our us operations market and economic disruptions of all types may affect consumer confidence levels and spending corporate investment and job creation bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer and corporate debt economic growth rates and asset values among other factors any such unfavorable conditions or developments could adversely impact us we also invest or trade in the securities of corporations and governments located in nonus jurisdictions including emerging markets revenues from the trading of nonus securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors furthermore the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because nonus trading markets particularly in emerging markets are generally smaller less liquid and more volatile than us trading markets our nonus businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by governments securities exchanges and regulators central banks and other regulatory bodies in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services and securities industries are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our potential inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could result in increased expenses and changes to our organizational structure and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations in that market as well as our reputation in general in connection with the uks exit from the eu we are now subject to different laws regulations and regulatory authorities and increased organizational and operational complexity we may incur additional costs andor experience negative tax consequences as a result of operating our principal eu banking and brokerdealer operations outside of the uk which could adversely impact our eu business results of operations and operational model further changes to the legal and regulatory framework under which our subsidiaries provide products and services in the uk and in the eu may result in additional compliance costs and have negative tax consequences or an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition to nonus legislation our international operations are also subject to us legal requirements which subjects us to operational and compliance costs and risks for example our operations are subject to us and nonus laws and regulations relating to bribery and corruption antimoney laundering and economic sanctions which can vary by jurisdiction the increasing speed and novel ways in which funds circulate could make it more challenging to track the movement of funds and heightens financial crimes risk our ability to comply with these legal requirements depends on our ability to continually improve surveillance detection and reporting and analytic capabilities in the us debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns which have increased the possibility of us government defaults on its debt andor downgrades to its credit ratings and prolonged government shutdowns could negatively impact the global economy and banking system and adversely affect our financial condition including our liquidity additionally changes in fiscal monetary or regulatory policy including as a result of the change in the us presidential administration and congress could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business operations organizational structure and results of operations we are also subject to geopolitical risks including economic sanctions acts or threats of international or domestic terrorism actions taken by the us or other governments in response thereto statesponsored cyber attacks or campaigns civil unrest andor military conflicts which could adversely affect business and economic conditions abroad and in the us business operations a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or business continuity plans or those of third parties or the financial services industry could disrupt our critical business operations and customer services result in regulatory market privacy liquidity and operational risk exposures and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition and cause legal or reputational harm the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and as a result of our interactions with and reliance on third parties including their downstream service providers and the financial services industry infrastructure our operational and security systems infrastructure including our computer systems emerging technologies data management and internal processes as well as those of third parties are integral to our performance we also rely on our employees and third parties including downstream service providers in our daytoday and ongoing operations who may as a result of human error misconduct including fraudulent activity malfeasance or a failure or breach of systems or infrastructure cause disruptions to our organization and expose us to operational and regulatory risk additionally our financial accounting data processing and transmission storage backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure or those of third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our or such third partys control which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services we could also experience prolonged computer and network outages resulting in disruptions to our critical business operations and customer services including abuse or failure of our electronic trading and algorithmic platforms we may experience sudden increases in customer transaction volume or electrical telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages newly identified vulnerabilities in key hardware or software failure of aging infrastructure and technology project implementation challenges which could result in prolonged operational outages climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires tornadoes hurricanes and floods which could result in increased exposure to operational risks including outages additionally events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including civil unrest and terrorist acts could result in operational disruptions and prolonged operational outages additionally the corporation and the third parties on which it relies have been and will likely continue to be subject to additional operational risks while operating in a workfromhome posture which places greater reliance on remote access tools and technology and employees personal systems while executing business continuity plans due to covid19 we are increasingly dependent upon our information technology infrastructure to operate our businesses remotely due to our workfromhome posture and evolving customer preferences including increased reliance on digital banking and other digital table start bank of america table end services provided by our businesses effective management of our workfromhome posture depends on the security reliability and adequacy of such systems we are also at greater risk of business disruptions due to illness and unavailability regardless of the measures we have taken to implement training procedures backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations and bolster our operational resilience our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties including their downstream service providers with whom we interact or upon whom we rely including systemic cyber events that result in system outages and unavailability of part or all of the financial services industry infrastructure our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems and the financial services industry infrastructure is more limited than with respect to our own systems furthermore to the extent that backup systems are available and utilized they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been backed up we regularly update the systems on which we rely to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws rules and regulations globally this updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones including business interruptions a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or business continuity plans resulting in disruption to our critical business operations and customer services could expose us to regulatory market privacy and liquidity risk and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition as well as cause legal or reputational harm a cyber attack information or security breach or a technology failure of ours or of a third party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information andor fraudulent activity and increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure our business is highly dependent on the security controls and efficacy of our infrastructure computer and data management systems as well as those of our customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties including their downstream service providers the financial services industry and financial data aggregators with whom we interact on whom we rely or who have access to our customers personal or account information our business relies on effective access management and the secure collection processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary personal and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access our network products and services our employees customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties increasingly use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks we our employees and customers regulators and other third parties including contractors and vendors are regularly the target of cyber attacks and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks these cyber attacks are pervasive sophisticated evolving difficult to prevent and include computer viruses malicious or destructive code such as ransomware social engineering including phishing vishing and smithing denial of service or information or other security breach tactics that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction or theft of confidential proprietary and other information including intellectual property of ours our employees our customers or of third parties these cyber attacks could also result in damages to systems financial risk or otherwise material disruption to our or our customers or other third parties network access or business operations both domestically and internationally our cybersecurity risk and exposure remains heightened because of among other things the evolving nature and pervasiveness of cyber threats our prominent size and scale our geographic footprint and international presence and our role in the financial services industry and the broader economy additionally our risk and exposure to cyber attacks and security breaches is magnified due to our workfromhome posture which places greater reliance on remote access tools and technology resulting in a larger number of access points to our networks that must be secured this increased risk of unauthorized access to our networks results in greater amounts of information being available for access from employees personal devices over which we do not have the same controls as we do in a nonworkfromhome posture additionally our customers increasing reliance on digital banking and other digital services provided by our businesses in response to covid19 has resulted in more demand on our information technology infrastructure and security tools and processes the financial services industry is particularly at risk because of the proliferation of new and emerging technologies including thirdparty financial data aggregators and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions additionally our use of automation artificial intelligence ai and robotics increased use of internet and mobile banking products including mobile payment and other web and cloudbased products and applications and plans to use or develop additional remote connectivity solutions increase our cybersecurity risks and exposure additionally we have exposure to cyber threats as a result of our continuous transmission of sensitive information to and storage of such information by third parties including our vendors and regulators the outsourcing of some of our business operations and system and customer account updates and conversions cybersecurity risks have also significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increasingly sophisticated activities of organized crime groups hackers terrorist organizations extremist parties hostile foreign governments and statesponsored actors in some instances acting to promote political ends we could also be the target of disgruntled employees or vendors activists and other parties including those involved in corporate espionage cyber threats and the techniques used in cyber attacks change rapidly and frequently despite substantial efforts to protect the integrity and resilience of our systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate cyber attacks or information or security breaches and implement effective preventive or defensive measures to address or mitigate such attacks or breaches even the most advanced internal control environment is vulnerable to compromise internal access management failures could result in the compromise or unauthorized exposure of confidential data cyber attacks or security breaches could persist for an extended period of time before being detected it could take considerable additional time for us to determine the scope extent amount and type of information compromised at which time the impact on the corporation and measures to recover and restore to a businessasusual state may be difficult to table start bank of america table end assess as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents and develop our capabilities to respond and recover as a result increasing resources to develop and enhance our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems workstations intellectual property and proprietary information software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remains a critical priority we also face indirect technology cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers clients and other third parties including their downstream service providers and the financial services industry with whom we do business upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities or upon whom our customers rely such third parties also include financial counterparties financial data aggregators financial intermediaries such as clearing agents exchanges and clearing houses vendors regulators providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power and retailers for whom we process transactions as a result of increasing consolidation interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyber attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities or third parties or their downstream service providers could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants including us similarly any failure cyber attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades deletes or compromises our systems or data could adversely impact third parties counterparties and the financial services industry infrastructure which in turn could harm our reputation and damage our business this consolidation interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure on both individual and industrywide bases as disparate systems need to be integrated often on an accelerated basis any technology failure cyber attack or other information or security breach termination or constraint of any third party including their downstream service providers the financial services industry infrastructure or financial data aggregators could among other things adversely affect our ability to conduct daytoday business activities effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses result in the misappropriation or destruction of the personal proprietary or confidential information of our employees customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties or result in fraudulent or unauthorized transactions further any such event may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner although to date we have not experienced any material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure cyber attacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures in place to monitor and mitigate the risks of cyber threats will be sufficient and that we will not suffer material losses or consequences in the future cyber attacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties may result in significant lost revenue give rise to losses and claims brought by third parties government penalties and other negative consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyber attack on our systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business although we maintain cyber insurance there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate also successful penetration or circumvention of system security could result in negative consequences including loss of customers and business opportunities the withdrawal of customer deposits prolonged computer and network outages resulting in disruptions to our critical business operations and customer services misappropriation or destruction of our intellectual property proprietary information or confidential information andor the confidential proprietary or personal information of certain parties such as our employees customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties or damage to their computers or systems this could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws in the us and abroad litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties or intervention loss of confidence in our security measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and our internal controls or disclosure controls being rendered ineffective the occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition failure to satisfy our obligations as servicer for residential mortgage securitizations loans owned by other entities and other losses we could incur as servicer could adversely impact our reputation servicing costs or results of operations we and our legacy companies service mortgage loans on behalf of thirdparty securitization vehicles and other investors if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice which could cause us to lose servicing income in addition we may have liability for any failure by us as a servicer or master servicer for any act or omission on our part that involves willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of our duties if any such breach was found to have occurred it may harm our reputation increase our servicing costs result in litigation or regulatory action or adversely impact our results of operations additionally with respect to foreclosures we may incur costs or losses due to irregularities in the underlying documentation or if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower or overturned by a court because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process we may also incur costs or losses relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in processing documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosure changes in the structure of and relationship among the gses could adversely impact our business during we sold approximately billion of loans to gses primarily freddie mac fhlmc fhlmc and fannie mae fnma are currently in conservatorship with their primary regulator the federal housing finance agency fhfa acting as conservator in september the treasury department published a proposal to recapitalize fhlmc and fnma and remove them from conservatorship as well as reduce their role in the marketplace consistent with this proposal in january the treasury department further amended the agreement that governs the conservatorship of fhlmc and fnma to allow them to retain their earnings until they reach certain previously determined capital requirements among other policy actions potentially putting them on a longterm path to emergence from conservatorship however we cannot predict the future prospects of the gses timing of the recapitalization or release from conservatorship or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the gses in the housing market additionally if the gses were to take a reduced role in table start bank of america table end the marketplace including by limiting the mortgage products they offer we could be required to seek alternative funding sources retain additional loans on our balance sheet secure funding through the federal home loan bank system or securitize the loans through private label securitization accordingly uncertainty regarding their future and the mortgagebacked securities they guarantee continues to exist for the foreseeable future any of these developments could adversely affect the value of our securities portfolios capital levels liquidity and results of operations our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us we seek to effectively and consistently identify measure monitor report and control the types of risk to which we are subject including strategic credit market liquidity compliance operational and reputational risks while we employ a broad and diversified set of controls and risk mitigation techniques including modeling and forecasting hedging strategies and techniques that seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses our ability to control and mitigate risks that result in losses is inherently limited by our ability to identify all risks including emerging and unknown risks anticipate the timing of risks apply effective hedging strategies make correct assumptions manage and aggregate data correctly and efficiently and develop risk management models to assess and control risk our ability to manage risk is dependent on our ability to consistently execute all elements of our risk management program and develop and maintain a culture of managing risk well throughout the corporation and manage risks associated with third parties including their downstream service providers and vendors to enable effective risk management and ensure that risks are appropriately considered evaluated and responded to in a timely manner uncertain economic conditions heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of and change within the financial services industry the pace of technological changes accounting and market developments the failure of employees to comply with policies values and our risk framework and the overall complexity of our operations among other developments may result in a heightened level of risk for us we have experienced increased operational reputational and compliance risk as a result of the need to rapidly implement multiple and varying pandemic relief programs including consumer and commercial assistance programs and the ppp coupled with the concurrent transition of the corporations workforce to a workfromhome posture accordingly we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to manage evolving risks or properly anticipate manage control or mitigate risks regulatory compliance and legal we are subject to comprehensive government legislation and regulations and certain settlements orders and agreements with government authorities from time to time we are subject to comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the us and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate including increasing and complex economic sanctions regimes these laws and regulations significantly affect and have the potential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities including the products and services we offer reduce certain fees and rates or make our products and services more expensive for our clients we continue to make adjustments to our business and operations legal entity structure and capital and liquidity management policies procedures and controls to comply with currently effective laws and regulations as well as final rulemaking guidance and interpretation by regulatory authorities including the department of treasury federal reserve occ cfpb financial stability oversight council fdic department of labor sec and cftc in the us and foreign regulators and other government authorities further we could become subject to future legislation and regulatory requirements beyond those currently proposed adopted or contemplated in the us or abroad including policies and rulemaking related to the financial reform act the pandemic and climate change the cumulative effect of all of the legislation and regulations on our business operations and profitability remains uncertain this uncertainty necessitates that in our business planning we make certain assumptions with respect to the scope and requirements of prospective and proposed rules if these assumptions prove incorrect we could be subject to increased regulatory and compliance risks and costs as well as potential reputational harm in addition us and international regulatory initiatives may overlap and nonus regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed us regulations which could lead to compliance risks and increased costs our regulators prudential and supervisory authority gives them broad power and discretion to direct our actions and they have assumed an active oversight inspection and investigatory role across the financial services industry however regulatory focus is not limited to laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry but extends to other significant laws and regulations that apply across industries and jurisdictions including those related to data management and privacy antimoney laundering anticorruption and economic sanctions we are also subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and abroad including gdpr ccpa and cpra regarding compliance with our privacy policies and the disclosure collection use sharing and safeguarding of personal identifiable information of certain parties such as our employees customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties the violation of which could result in litigation regulatory fines and enforcement actions additionally we will likely be subject to new and evolving data privacy laws in the us and abroad which could result in additional costs of compliance litigation regulatory fines and enforcement actions in particular there is increased complexity and uncertainty including potential suspension or prohibition regarding the standards used by the corporation for crossborder flows and transfers of personal data from the european economic area eea to the us and other jurisdictions outside of the eea resulting from a decision of the court of justice of the eu and guidance from the european data protection board additionally the european commission has proposed new standards of personal data transfer if our personal data transfers are suspended or prohibited or we are required to implement new standards this could result in operational disruptions to our businesses additional costs increased enforcement activity new contract negotiations with third parties andor modification of our crossborder data management as part of their enforcement authority our regulators and other government authorities have the authority to among other things assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties or restitution and issue cease and desist or removal orders and table start bank of america table end initiate injunctive actions the amounts paid by us and other financial institutions to settle proceedings or investigations have in some instances been substantial and may increase in some cases governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such resolutions which could have significant consequences including reputational harm loss of customers restrictions on the ability to access capital markets and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time the corporation and the conduct of its employees and representatives are subject to regulatory scrutiny across jurisdictions the complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the us coupled with the global scope of our operations and the regulatory environment worldwide also means that a single event or practice or a series of related events or practices may give rise to a significant number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings either by multiple federal and state agencies in the us or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions additionally actions by other members of the financial services industry related to business activities in which we participate may result in investigations by regulators or other government authorities responding to inquiries investigations lawsuits and proceedings is timeconsuming and expensive and can divert senior management attention from our business the outcome of such proceedings which may last a number of years may be difficult to predict or estimate we are and may become subject to the terms of settlements orders and agreements that we have entered into with government entities and regulatory authorities which impose or could impose significant operational and compliance costs on us as they typically require us to enhance our procedures and controls expand our risk and control functions within our lines of business invest in technology and hire significant numbers of additional risk control and compliance personnel moreover if we fail to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements orders or agreements to which we are subject or more generally fail to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by our regulators and other government authorities we could be required to enter into further settlements orders or agreements and pay additional fines penalties or judgments or accept material regulatory restrictions on our businesses while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to identify assess monitor and report on applicable laws policies and procedures compliance risks will continue to exist particularly as we adapt to new and evolving laws rules and regulations additionally changing us fiscal monetary and regulatory policies arising from changes to the us presidential administration and congress result in ongoing regulatory uncertainties there is no guarantee that our risk management and compliance programs will be consistently executed to successfully manage compliance risk we also rely upon third parties who may expose us to compliance and legal risk future legislative or regulatory actions and any required changes to our business or operations or those of third parties including their downstream providers upon whom we rely resulting from such developments and actions could result in a significant loss of revenue impose additional compliance and other costs or otherwise reduce our profitability limit the products and services that we offer or our ability to pursue certain business opportunities require us to dispose of or curtail certain businesses affect the value of assets that we hold require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products or otherwise adversely affect our businesses in addition legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time that may result in fines regulatory sanctions penalties equitable relief and changes to our business practices as a result we are and will continue to be subject to heightened compliance and operating costs that could adversely affect our results of operations we are subject to significant financial and reputational risks from potential liability arising from lawsuits and regulatory and government action we continue to face significant legal risks in our business with a high volume of claims against us and other financial institutions the damages penalties and fines that litigants and regulators seek from us and other financial institutions continue to be high this includes disputes with consumers customers and other counterparties financial institutions including us continue to be the subject of claims alleging anticompetitive conduct with respect to various products and markets including us antitrust class actions claiming joint and several liability for treble damages as disclosed in note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements we also face contractual indemnification and loanrepurchase claims arising from alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the sale of residential mortgages by legacy companies which may result in a requirement that we repurchase the mortgage loans or otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to counterparties in addition regulatory authorities have had a supervisory focus on enforcement including in connection with alleged violations of law and customer harm for example us regulators and government agencies have pursued claims against financial institutions under the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act false claims act equal credit opportunity act fair housing act and antitrust laws such claims may carry significant and in certain cases treble damages t here is also an increased focus on compliance with global laws rules and regulations related to the collection use sharing and safeguarding of personally identifiable information and corporate data additionally misconduct by employees including unethical fraudulent improper or illegal conduct or other unfair deceptive abusive or discriminatory business practices can result in litigation andor government investigations and enforcement actions and cause significant reputational harm the global environment of extensive regulation regulatory compliance burdens litigation and regulatory enforcement combined with uncertainty related to the continually evolving regulatory environment may affect operational and compliance costs and risks which may limit or cease our ability to continue providing certain products and services this is magnified by the corporations implementation of government relief measures related to the pandemic lawsuits and regulatory actions may result in judgments settlements penalties and fines adverse to the corporation litigation and investigation costs substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or government action against us could have adverse effects on our business financial condition including liquidity and results of operations andor cause significant reputational harm to us us federal banking agencies may require us to increase our regulatory capital total lossabsorbing capacity tlac longterm debt or liquidity requirements we are subject to us regulatory capital and liquidity rules these rules among other things establish minimum requirements to qualify as a wellcapitalized institution if any of table start bank of america table end our subsidiary insured depository institutions fails to maintain its status as well capitalized under the applicable regulatory capital rules the federal reserve will require us to agree to bring the insured depository institution back to wellcapitalized status for the duration of such an agreement the federal reserve may impose restrictions on our activities if we were to fail to enter into or comply with such an agreement or fail to comply with the terms of such agreement the federal reserve may impose more severe restrictions on our activities including requiring us to cease and desist activities permitted under the bank holding company act of capital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and amended it is possible that regulators may increase regulatory capital requirements including tlac and longterm debt requirements change how regulatory capital is calculated or increase liquidity requirements our ability to return capital to our shareholders depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers to the extent that increases occur in our scb gsib surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer our returns of capital to shareholders could decrease as part of its ccar the federal reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the federal reserve those scenarios may affect our ccar stress test results which may impact the level of our scb additionally the federal reserve may impose limitations or prohibitions on taking capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing common stock for example as a result of the economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic the federal reserve applied certain restrictions on our common stock dividends and repurchase program during the second half of and the first quarter of as disclosed in item business distributions on page and mda executive summary recent developments capital management on page a significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our rwa and our leverage exposure which may increase the basel committee on banking supervision has also revised several key methodologies for measuring rwa that have not yet been implemented in the us including a standardized approach for operational risk revised market risk requirements and constraints on the use of internal models as well as a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches us banking regulators may update the us basel rules to incorporate the basel committee revisions changes to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets increase borrowings issue additional equity or other securities cease or alter certain operations or hold highly liquid assets which may adversely affect our results of operations changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain if those assumptions estimates or judgments were incorrectly made we could be required to correct and restate priorperiod financial statements accounting standardsetters and those who interpret the accounting standards the sec banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied these changes may be difficult to predict and could impact how we prepare and report our financial statements in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively resulting in us revising priorperiod financial statements we may be adversely affected by changes in us and nonus tax laws and regulations in december the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted which made significant changes to federal income tax law including among other things reducing the statutory corporate income tax rate to percent from percent and changing the taxation of our nonus business activities in addition we have uk net deferred tax assets dta which consist primarily of net operating losses that are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years adverse developments with respect to tax laws or to other material factors such as prolonged worsening of europes capital markets or changes in the ability of our uk subsidiaries to conduct business in the eu could lead our management to reassess andor change its current conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary with respect to our uk net dta it is possible that governmental authorities in the us andor other countries could further amend or repeal tax laws in a way that would adversely affect us including the possibility that aspects of the tax act could be amended in the future any future change in tax laws and regulations or interpretations of current or future tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations reputation damage to our reputation could harm our businesses including our competitive position and business prospects our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and employees is impacted by our reputation harm to our reputation can arise from various sources including officer director or employee fraud misconduct and unethical behavior security breaches litigation or regulatory outcomes compensation practices lending practices the suitability or reasonableness of recommending particular trading or investment strategies including the reliability of our research and models prohibiting clients from engaging in certain transactions and employee sales practices additionally our reputation may be harmed by failing to deliver products subpar standards of service and quality expected by our customers clients and the community compliance failures the inability to manage technology change or maintain effective data management cyber incidents internal and external fraud inadequacy of responsiveness to internal controls unintended disclosure of personal proprietary or confidential information conflicts of interest and breach of fiduciary obligations the handling of health emergencies or pandemics and the activities of our clients customers counterparties and third parties including vendors for example our reputation may be harmed in connection with our implementation of government programs to provide relief to address the economic impact of the pandemic our reputation may also be negatively impacted by our esg practices and disclosures our businesses and our customers including practices and disclosures related to climate change actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect our reputation in addition adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media by employees the media or otherwise whether or not factually table start bank of america table end correct may adversely impact our business prospects or financial results we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy knowyourcustomer requirements data protection including the gdpr ccpa and cpra crossborder data movement and other matters principles concerning the appropriate scope of consumer and commercial privacy vary considerably in different jurisdictions and regulatory and public expectations regarding the definition and scope of consumer and commercial privacy may remain fluid it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied by various jurisdictions in a manner inconsistent with our current or future practices or that is inconsistent with one another if personal confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in our possession or in the possession of third parties including their downstream service providers or financial data aggregators is mishandled misused or mismanaged or if we do not timely or adequately address such information we may face regulatory reputational and operational risks which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we could suffer reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to use our products and services or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business our actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues such as operational risks gives rise to reputational risk that could harm us and our business prospects failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions legal risks and reputational harm which could among other consequences increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses other reforms to and replacement of ibors and certain other rates or indices may adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations there is a major transition in progress in global financial markets with respect to the replacement of ibors including the london interbank offered rate libor and certain other rates or indices that serve as benchmarks such benchmarks are used extensively across global financial markets and in our business in particular libor is used in many of our products and contracts including derivatives consumer and commercial loans mortgages floatingrate notes and other adjustablerate products and financial instruments the aggregate notional amount of these products and contracts is material to our business and there are significant risks and challenges associated with the transition that may result in significant uncertainty or have other consequences that cannot be fully anticipated which expose us to various financial operational supervisory conduct and legal risks although certain arrs have been proposed to replace libor and other ibors market and client adoption of arrs may vary across or within categories of contracts products and services resulting in market fragmentation decreased trading volumes and liquidity increased complexity and modeling and operational risks arrs have compositions and characteristics that differ significantly from the benchmarks they may replace in some cases have limited history and may demonstrate less predictable performance over time than the benchmarks they replace additionally most arrs are calculated on a compounded or weightedaverage basis involve complex billing and reconciliation and unlike ibors do not reflect bank credit risk and therefore may require a spread adjustment the market transition from ibors to arrs is complex and there are important differences between the fallbacks triggers and calculation methodologies being implemented in cash and derivatives markets including within cash markets any mismatch between the adoption of arrs in loans securities and derivatives markets may impact hedging or other financial arrangements we have implemented and as a result we may experience unanticipated market exposures there can be no assurance that arrs will be comparable or adequate alternatives to ibors or perform in the same way that existing assets and liabilities based on or linked to ibors will transition successfully to arrs of the timing of adoption and degree of integration and acceptance of arrs in the financial markets or of the future availability or representativeness of such arrs the discontinuation of ibors including libor requires us to transition a significant number of iborbased products and contracts including related hedging arrangements ibor products although a significant majority of the aggregate notional amount of our liborbased products and contracts maturing after include or have been updated to include fallbacks to arrs the transitioning of certain contracts products and clients will be more complex while some of these outstanding ibor products include fallback provisions to arrs some of these products and contracts do not include fallback provisions or adequate fallback mechanisms and require remediation to modify their terms additionally some outstanding ibor products are particularly challenging to modify due to the requirement that all impacted parties consent to such modification legislation has been adopted in the eu and proposed in the us and the uk to address such challenges in ibor products including the use of a statutory replacement or synthetic rate to replace the existing benchmark rate in certain of our ibor products litigation disputes or other action may occur as a result of the interpretation or application of legislation in particular if there is an overlap between legislation introduced in different jurisdictions there is no guarantee that the legislative proposals will become law and no assurance that we and other market participants will be able to successfully modify all outstanding ibor products or be adequately prepared for a discontinuation of an ibor at the time such ibor may cease to be published or otherwise discontinued also there can be no assurance that existing or new provisions for successor rates in our ibor products will include adequate methodologies for adjustments or that the characteristics of the successor rates will be similar to or produce the economic equivalent of the benchmarks they seek to replace these changes may adversely affect the yield on loans or securities held by us amounts paid on securities we have issued amounts received and paid on derivatives we have entered into the value of such loans securities or derivative instruments the trading market for such products and contracts and our ability to effectively use hedging instruments to manage risk certain impacted clients counterparties and other market participants may refuse delay or lack operational readiness to transition to arrs resulting in the risk that some contracts and products may not transition to an arr before discontinuation of the relevant ibor exposing us to financial operational supervisory conduct and legal risks table start bank of america table end our products and contracts that reference ibors in particular libor may contain language that determines when a successor rate including the arr andor the applicable spread adjustment to the designated rate including ibors would be selected or determined if a trigger is satisfied our products and contracts may give the calculation agent which may be
