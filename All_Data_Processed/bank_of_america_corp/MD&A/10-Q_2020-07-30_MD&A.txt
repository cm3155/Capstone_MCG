analysis in table assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates as part of our alm activities we use securities certain residential mortgages and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity the behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the sensitivity analysis in table assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our alm activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk we use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components for more information on our hedging activities see note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements for more information on interest rate contracts and risk management see interest rate risk management for the banking book in the mda of the corporations annual report on form 10k we use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions collectively referred to as cash flow hedges the net results on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated oci were a gain of million and a loss of million on a pretax basis at june and december these gains losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at june the aftertax net gains are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows a gain of million within the next year a gain of million in years two through five a loss of million in years six through ten with the remaining loss of million thereafter for more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges see note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements we hedge our net investment in nonus operations determined to have functional currencies other than the us dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than days crosscurrency basis swaps and foreign exchange

significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities we have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments for more information see complex accounting estimates in the mda of the corporations annual report on form 10k and note summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements of the corporations annual report on form 10k except as noted below under allowance for credit losses there have not been any material updates to our complex accounting estimates as disclosed in the mda of the corporations annual report on form 10k bank of america allowance for credit losses on january the corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments to be based on managements best estimate of lifetime ecl inherent in the corporations relevant financial assets the corporations estimate of lifetime ecl includes the use of quantitative models that incorporate forwardlooking macroeconomic scenarios that are applied over the contractual life of the loan portfolios adjusted for expected prepayments and borrower controlled extension options these macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses these variables include but are not limited to unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product levels corporate bond spreads and longterm interest rate forecasts as any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain the corporation leverages multiple scenarios the scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events leading economic indicators views of internal and thirdparty economists and industry trends the corporation also includes qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but in the corporations assessment may not be adequately represented in the economic assumptions described above for example factors that the corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures business conditions the nature and size of the portfolio portfolio concentrations the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements among others further the corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data the allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio such as increases in risk rating downgrades in our commercial portfolio deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio or increases in ltvs in our consumer real estate portfolio in addition while we have incorporated our estimated impact of covid19 into our allowance for credit losses the ultimate impact of the pandemic is still unknown including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses as described above the process to determine the allowance for credit losses requires numerous estimates and assumptions some of which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated changes in the estimates and assumptions can result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is further discussed in note summary of significant accounting principles and note outstanding loans and leases and allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangible assets the nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in note summary of significant accounting principles and note goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements as of june goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was as follows table goodwill by reporting unit dollars in millions june december consumer banking consumer lending deposits global wealth and investment management private bank merrill lynch global wealth management global banking global commercial banking global corporate and investment banking business banking global markets all other total we perform goodwill impairment testing at least annually unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of june in performing that test we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its estimated carrying value as measured by allocated equity we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit based on the income approach which utilizes the present value of cash flows to estimate fair value and the market multiplier approach which utilizes observable market prices and metrics of peer companies to estimate fair value our discounted cash flows were generally based on the corporations threeyear internal forecasts with a longterm growth rate of percent our estimated cash flows take into account the current challenging global industry and market conditions related to the covid19 pandemic including the low interest rate environment the cash flows were discounted using rates that range from percent to percent which were derived from a capital asset pricing model that incorporates the risk and uncertainty in the cash flow forecasts the financial markets and industries similar to each of the reporting units under the market multiplier approach we estimated the fair value of the individual reporting units utilizing various market multiples primarily various pricing multiples from comparable publiclytraded companies in industries similar to the reporting unit and then factored in a control premium based upon observed comparable premiums paid for changeincontrol transactions for financial institutions based on the results of the test we determined that each reporting units estimated fair value exceeded its respective carrying value and that the goodwill assigned to each reporting unit as of june was not impaired the fair values of the reporting units as a percentage of their carrying values ranged from percent to percent as it currently remains difficult to predict the economic impacts related to the covid19 pandemic we will continue to monitor key assumptions and other factors utilized in our impairment analysis it is possible that during the remainder of economic and market conditions both in the us and internationally could further deteriorate which could negatively impact our reporting units if our key assumptions and related estimates change we may be required to record an impairment charge in the future bank of america
