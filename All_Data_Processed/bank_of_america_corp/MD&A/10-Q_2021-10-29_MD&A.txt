recurring tax preference benefits primarily consist of tax credits from esg investments in affordable housing and renewable energy aligning with our responsible growth strategy to address global

information to assess our financial condition results of operations including periodtoperiod operating performance or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements these nongaap financial measures are not intended as a substitute for gaap financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as nongaap financial measures used by other companies we view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an fte basis which when presented on a consolidated basis are nongaap financial measures to derive the fte basis net interest income is adjusted to reflect taxexempt income on an equivalent beforetax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense for purposes of this calculation we use the federal statutory tax rate of percent and a representative state tax rate net interest yield which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds utilizes net interest income on an fte basis we believe that presentation of these items on an fte basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and taxexempt sources and is consistent with industry practices we may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items eg debit valuation adjustment dva gains losses which result in nongaap financial measures we believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of periodtoperiod operating performance we also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity a nongaap financial measure tangible equity represents shareholders equity or common shareholders equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets excluding mortgage servicing rights msrs net of related deferred tax liabilities adjusted shareholders equity or common shareholders equity these measures are used to evaluate our use of equity in addition profitability relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible

presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment the interest rate scenarios also assume us dollar rates are floored at zero during the nine months ended september the decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to uprate and downrate scenarios was primarily due to alm activity and an increase in longend rates we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve additionally higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and accordingly for debt securities classified as afs may adversely affect accumulated oci and thus capital levels under the basel capital rules under instantaneous upward parallel shifts the nearterm adverse impact to basel capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income for more information on basel see capital management regulatory capital on page table

no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates as part of our alm activities we use securities certain residential mortgages and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity the behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the sensitivity analysis in table assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts we use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our alm activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks specifically we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks our interest rate derivative contracts are generally nonleveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps options futures and forwards and our foreign exchange contracts include crosscurrency interest rate swaps foreign currency futures contracts foreign currency forward contracts and options the derivatives used in our alm activities can be split into two broad categories designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the interest rate risk management for the banking book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in table the corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations by hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations the corporations market risk exposure in this area is insignificant risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the corporations nontrading foreign currencydenominated financial instruments these foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as crosscurrency basis spreads and interest rate risk however as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives the market risk related to this exposure is insignificant for more information on the accounting for derivatives see note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements mortgage
