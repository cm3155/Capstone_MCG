may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies we take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined risk framework and an articulated risk appetite statement which are approved annually by the erc and the board the seven key types of risk faced by the corporation are strategic credit market liquidity compliance operational and reputational strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition arising from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors inappropriate business plans ineffective business strategy execution or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings market risk is composed of price risk and interest rate risk liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the corporation arising from the failure of the corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws rules and regulations and our internal policies and procedures operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes people and systems or from external events reputational risk is the risk that negative perceptions of the corporations conduct or business practices may adversely impact its profitability or operations the following sections address in more detail the specific procedures measures and analyses of the major categories of risk this discussion of managing risk focuses on the current risk framework that as part of its annual review process was approved by the erc and the board as set forth in our risk framework a culture of managing risk well is fundamental to fulfilling our purpose and our values and delivering responsible growth it requires us to focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promotes sound risktaking within our risk appetite sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to our success and is a clear expectation of our executive management team and the board our risk framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the corporation the risk framework sets forth clear roles responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the board through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities executive management assesses with board oversight the riskadjusted returns of each business management reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans as well as the capital plan and risk appetite statement and recommends them annually to the board for approval our strategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and financial resources which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite management sets financial objectives for each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital for each business capital allocations and operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which we operate continue to evolve for more information regarding capital allocations see business segment operations on page the corporations risk appetite indicates the amount of capital earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans consistent with applicable regulatory requirements our risk appetite provides a common and comparable set of measures for senior management and the board to clearly indicate our aggregate level of risk and to monitor whether the corporations risk profile remains in alignment with our strategic and capital plans our risk appetite is formally articulated in the risk appetite statement which includes both qualitative components and quantitative limits our overall capacity to take risk is limited therefore we prioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial position so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities therefore we set objectives and targets for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner including during periods of stress our lines of business operate with risk limits which may include credit market andor operational limits as applicable that align with the corporations risk appetite executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits the board and its committees when appropriate oversee financial performance execution

a final rule to establish capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants that are not subject to existing us prudential regulation under the rule applicable subsidiaries of the corporation would be permitted to elect one of two approaches to compute their regulatory capital the first approach is a bankbased capital approach which requires that firms maintain cet1 capital greater than or equal to percent of the entitys rwa as calculated under basel total capital greater than or equal to percent of the entitys rwa as calculated under basel and total capital greater than or equal to percent of the entitys uncleared swap margin the second approach is based on net liquid assets and requires that a firm maintain net capital greater than or equal to percent of its

reserve federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency us agencies finalized a rule requiring advanced approaches institutions to deduct from regulatory capital certain investments in tlaceligible longterm debt and other pari passu or subordinated debt instruments issued by gsibs above a specified threshold the final rule is intended to limit the

removing the requirement for banking organizations to deduct from tier capital ownership interests of covered funds acquired or retained under the underwriting or marketmaking exemptions of the volcker rule which the banking entity did not organize or offer singlecounterparty credit limits the federal reserve established singlecounterparty credit limits sccl for bhcs with total consolidated assets of billion or more the sccl rule is designed to ensure that the maximum possible loss that a bhc could incur due to the default of a single counterparty or a group of connected counterparties would not endanger the bhcs survival thereby reducing the probability of future financial crises beginning january gsibs must calculate sccl on a daily basis by dividing the aggregate net credit exposure to a given counterparty by the gsibs tier capital ensuring that exposures to other gsibs and nonbank financial institutions regulated by the federal reserve do not breach percent of tier

fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity liquidity stress analysis we utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios the scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate marketwide and corporationspecific events including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios the scenarios are based on our historical experience experience of distressed and failed financial institutions regulatory guidance and both expected and unexpected future events the types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include but are not limited to upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuances diminished access to secured financing markets potential deposit withdrawals increased draws on loan commitments liquidity facilities and letters of credit additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities changes in certain market factors including but not limited to credit rating downgrades could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results we consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity we also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses net stable funding ratio final rule on october the us agencies finalized the net stable funding ratio nsfr a rule requiring large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a oneyear period the final rule is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the lcr rule which focuses on shortterm liquidity risks the final rule is effective july the us nsfr would apply to the corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions the corporation expects to be in compliance within the final nsfr rule in the regulatory timeline provided and does not expect any significant impacts to the corporation diversified funding sources we fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products programs markets currencies and investor groups the primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control reduced funding costs wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries where regulations time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt we fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits which were trillion and trillion at december and deposits are primarily generated by our consumer banking gwim and global banking segments these deposits are diversified by clients product type and geography and the majority of our us deposits are insured by the fdic we consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable lowcost and consistent source of funding we believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings including credit card securitizations and securitizations with governmentsponsored enterprises gse the fha and privatelabel investors as well as fhlb loans our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions we believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more costefficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing repurchase agreements are generally shortterm and often overnight disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant table start bank of america table end reductions in the availability of such financing we manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations

costefficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile while the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the corporation we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter we may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes certain of which qualify as tlaceligible debt during we issued billion of structured notes which are unsecured debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities indices currencies or commodities we typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives andor investments in the underlying instruments so that from a funding perspective the cost is similar to our other unsecured longterm debt we could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances which we consider for liquidity planning purposes we believe however that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment require additional collateral support result in changes to terms accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings

liquidity stress events at various levels of severity these policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions we periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness our us bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the federal reserve discount window certain nonus subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate while we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling we maintain the policies procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary credit ratings our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings in addition credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions including overthecounter otc derivatives thus it is our objective to maintain highquality credit ratings and management maintains an active dialogue with the

our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities historical cost however these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates the risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our alm activities we have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income trading positions are subject to various changes in marketbased risk factors the majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate foreign exchange credit equity and commodities markets in addition the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility we seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments the key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the trading risk management section global risk management is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed these responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy developing and maintaining quantitative risk models calculating aggregated risk measures establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements market risks that impact businesses outside of global markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports given that models are used across the corporation model risk impacts all risk types including credit market and operational risks the enterprise model risk policy defines model risk standards consistent with our risk framework and risk appetite prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice all models including risk management valuation and regulatory capital models must meet certain validation criteria including effective challenge of the conceptual soundness of the model independent model testing and ongoing monitoring through outcomes analysis and benchmarking the enterprise model risk committee emrc a subcommittee of the mrc oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the corporation interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates these instruments include but are not limited to loans debt securities certain tradingrelated assets and liabilities deposits borrowings and derivatives hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options futures forwards and swaps foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in nonus subsidiaries foreign currencydenominated loans and securities future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions foreign currencydenominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or nonus interest rates hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options currency swaps futures forwards and foreign currencydenominated debt and deposits mortgage risk mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgagerelated instruments the values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates mortgage rates agency debt ratings default market liquidity government participation and interest rate volatility our exposure to these instruments takes several forms for example we trade and engage in marketmaking activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans passthrough certificates commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including collateralized debt obligations using mortgages as underlying collateral in addition we originate a variety of mbs which involves the accumulation of

spreads by credit migration or by defaults hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds cds and other credit fixedincome instruments market liquidity risk market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and in certain cases may even cease this exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results this impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments we utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in trading risk management trading risk management to evaluate risks in our trading activities we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the corporation these measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves such as var and stress testing periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations additionally risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments var is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors including the effects of portfolio diversification a var model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses var represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period based on a specified holding period confidence level and window of historical data we use one var model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a threeyear window of historical data our primary var statistic is equivalent to a percent confidence level which means that for a var with a oneday holding period there should not be losses in excess of var on average out of trading days within any var model there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company the accuracy of a var model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio a var model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available for positions with insufficient historical data for the var calculation the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position this analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience var may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results in particular the historical data used for the var calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced in order for the var model to reflect current market conditions we update the historical data underlying our var model on a weekly basis or more frequently during periods of market stress and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model a minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in var these risks are reviewed as part of our icaap for more information regarding icaap see capital management on page global risk management continually reviews evaluates and enhances our var model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio changes to the var model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees trading limits on quantitative risk measures including var are independently set by global markets risk management and reviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity volatility and strategic business priorities trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors all trading limits are approved at least annually approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the corporations risk appetite statement these risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the erc and the board in periods of market stress global markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses key risk positions and any limit excesses as a result of this process the businesses may selectively reduce risk table presents the total marketbased portfolio var which is the combination of the total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio and the fair value option portfolio covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities both on and offbalance sheet that meet a defined set of specifications these specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a shortterm horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a twoway market positions in less liquid markets or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions typically do not qualify as covered positions foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval in addition table presents our fair value option

portfolio portfolio diversification total marketbased portfolio table end backtesting the accuracy of the var methodology is evaluated by backtesting which compares the daily var results utilizing a oneday holding period against a comparable subset of trading revenue a backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the var for the corresponding day these excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to ensure that the var methodology accurately represents those losses we expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of var to be in line with the confidence level of the var statistic being tested for example with a percent confidence level we expect one trading loss in excess of var every days or between two to three trading losses in excess of var over the course of a year the number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the var calculation the trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the var component of the regulatory capital calculation this revenue differs from total tradingrelated revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in var some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading revenues we conduct daily backtesting on the var results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the var results for key legal entities regions and risk factors these results are reported to senior market risk management senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests during there were seven days where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio var utilizing a oneday holding period total tradingrelated revenue total tradingrelated revenue excluding brokerage fees and cva dva and funding valuation adjustment gains losses represents the total amount earned from trading positions including marketbased net interest income which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets for more information on fair value see note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements tradingrelated revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand also tradingrelated revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions the level of risk assumed and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the everchanging market environment significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed the following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of tradingrelated revenue for and during positive tradingrelated revenue was recorded for percent of the trading days of which percent were daily trading gains of over million and the largest loss was million this compares to where positive tradingrelated revenue was recorded for percent of the trading days of which percent were daily trading gains of over million and the largest loss was million trading portfolio stress testing because the very nature of a var model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis this analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements a set of scenarios categorized as either historical or hypothetical are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses these scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate var historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress generally a multiweek period representing the most table start bank of america table end severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from potential future market stress events scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information in addition new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio the stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprisewide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework the macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprisewide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning for more information see managing risk on page interest rate risk management for the banking book the following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates clientfacing activities primarily lending and deposittaking create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet we prepare forwardlooking forecasts of net interest income the baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth alm positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the marketbased forward curve we then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions the net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends market conditions and business strategies thus we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes the interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing changes in funding mix product repricing maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital table presents the spot and 12month forward

rates are floored at zero during the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet increased in both uprate and downrate scenarios primarily due to continued deposit growth invested in longterm securities we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve additionally higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and accordingly for debt securities classified as afs may adversely affect accumulated oci and thus capital levels under the basel capital rules under instantaneous

sensitivity analysis in table assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates as part of our alm activities we use securities certain residential mortgages and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity the behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the sensitivity analysis in table assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts interest rate and

extensive policy legal technology and market changes and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods as well as chronic longerterm shifts such as temperature increases and sea level rises these changes and events can have broad impacts on operations supply chains distribution networks customers and markets and are otherwise referred to respectively as transition risk and physical risk the financial impacts of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk physical risk can also lead to increased credit

america website the content of which is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k complex accounting estimates our significant accounting principles as described in note summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements are essential in understanding the mda many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities we have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments the more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion we have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates in many cases there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models where alternatives exist we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could materially impact our results of operations separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables the value of our lending portfolio and marketsensitive assets and table start bank of america table end liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date often significantly due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant negative effect on future operating results these fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs allowance for credit losses on january the corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments to be based on managements best estimate of lifetime ecl inherent in the corporations relevant financial assets the corporations estimate of lifetime ecl includes the use of quantitative models that incorporate forwardlooking macroeconomic scenarios that are applied over the contractual life of the loan portfolios adjusted for expected prepayments and borrowercontrolled extension options these macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses these variables include but are not limited to unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product and corporate bond spreads as any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain the corporation leverages multiple scenarios the scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events leading economic indicators views of internal and thirdparty economists and industry trends the corporation also includes qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but in the corporations assessment may not be adequately reflected in the economic assumptions described above for example factors the corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures business conditions the nature and size of the portfolio portfolio concentrations the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements among others further the corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data the allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio such as increases in risk rating downgrades in our commercial portfolio deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio or increases in ltvs in our consumer real estate portfolio in addition while we have incorporated our estimated impact of covid19 into our allowance for credit losses the ultimate impact of the pandemic is still unknown including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses as described above the process to determine the allowance for credit losses requires numerous estimates and assumptions some of which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated changes in the estimates and assumptions can result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is further discussed in note summary of significant accounting principles and note outstanding loans and leases and allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements fair value of financial instruments under applicable accounting standards we are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value we classify fair value measurements of financial instruments and msrs based on the threelevel fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards the fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments such as market liquidity and credit quality where appropriate valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs where market data is available the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity in periods of extreme volatility lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process in keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities we have in place various processes and controls that include a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products primarily through validation controls we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both marketobservable and internallymodeled values andor valuation inputs our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker andor pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling for example broker quotes in less active markets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable these processes and controls are performed independently of the business for more information see note fair value measurements and note fair value option to the consolidated financial statements level assets and liabilities financial assets and liabilities and msrs where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as level under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting standards the fair value of these level financial assets and liabilities and msrs is determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation level financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as level or therefore gains or losses associated with level financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy the level gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital we conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis transfers into or out of level are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and table start bank of america table end liabilities became unobservable or observable respectively in the current marketplace for more information on transfers into and out of level during and see note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements accrued income taxes and deferred tax assets accrued income taxes reported as a component of either other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date we currently file income tax returns in more than jurisdictions and consider many factors including statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction net deferred tax assets reported as a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheet represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss nol and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements nol and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods we consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts that we estimate are more likely than not to be realized consistent with the applicable accounting guidance we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimates of accrued income taxes andor net deferred tax assets due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities these revisions of our estimates which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax audit matters may be material to our operating results for any given period see note income taxes to the consolidated financial

by allocated equity we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit based on the income approach which utilizes the present value of cash flows to estimate fair value and the market multiplier approach which utilizes observable market prices and metrics of peer companies to estimate fair value our discounted cash flows were generally based on the corporations threeyear internal forecasts with a longterm growth rate of percent our estimated cash flows considered the current challenging global industry and market conditions related to the pandemic including the low interest rate environment the cash flows were discounted using rates that ranged from percent to percent which were derived from a capital asset pricing model that incorporates the risk and uncertainty in the cash flow forecasts the financial markets and industries similar to each of the reporting units under the market multiplier approach we estimated the fair value of the individual reporting units utilizing various market multiples primarily various pricing multiples from comparable publiclytraded companies in industries similar to the reporting unit and then factored in a control premium based upon observed comparable premiums paid for changeincontrol transactions for financial institutions based on the results of the test we determined that each reporting units estimated fair value exceeded its respective carrying value and that the goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was not impaired the fair values of the reporting units as a percentage of their carrying values ranged from percent to percent it currently remains difficult to estimate the future economic impacts related to the pandemic if economic and market conditions both in the us and internationally deteriorate our reporting units could be negatively impacted which could change our key assumptions and related estimates and may result in a future impairment charge certain contingent liabilities for more information on the
