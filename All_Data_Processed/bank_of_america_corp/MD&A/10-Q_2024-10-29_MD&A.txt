financial measures nongaap financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with gaap nongaap financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition results of operations including periodtoperiod operating performance or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements these nongaap financial measures are not intended as a substitute for gaap financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as nongaap financial measures used by other companies when presented on a consolidated basis we view net interest income on an fte basis as a nongaap financial measure to derive the fte basis net interest income is adjusted to reflect taxexempt income on an equivalent beforetax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense for purposes of this calculation we use the federal statutory tax rate of percent and a representative state tax rate net interest yield which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds utilizes net interest income on an fte basis we believe that presentation of these items on an fte basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and taxexempt sources and is consistent with industry practices we may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items eg debit valuation adjustment dva gains losses which result in nongaap financial measures we believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of periodtoperiod operating performance we also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity a nongaap financial measure tangible equity represents shareholders equity or common shareholders equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets excluding mortgage servicing rights msrs net of related deferred tax liabilities adjusted shareholders equity or common shareholders equity these measures are used to evaluate our use of equity in addition profitability relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible

shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders equity the tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by total tangible assets return on average tangible shareholders equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders equity the tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders equity divided by total tangible assets tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by ending common shares outstanding we believe ratios

for more information on our market risk management process see market risk management in the mda of the corporations annual report on form 10k for more information on market risks see the market section within item risk factors of the corporations annual report on form 10k market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations primarily within our global markets segment we are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the corporation eg our alm activities in the event of market stress these risks could have a material impact on our results trading risk management to evaluate risks in our trading activities we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions var is a common statistic used to measure market risk our primary var statistic is equivalent to a percent confidence level which means that for a var with a oneday holding period there should not be losses in excess of var on average out of trading days

behavioral customer deposit balance changes that could occur under various scenarios while static deposits assumes no deposit balance change na not applicable bank of america we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve additionally higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated oci and thus capital levels under the basel capital rules under instantaneous upward parallel shifts the nearterm adverse impact to basel capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from banking book activities for more information on basel see capital management regulatory capital on page as part of our alm activities we use securities certain residential mortgages and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity the sensitivity analysis in table assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates beginning in the second quarter of the sensitivity analysis incorporates potential movements in customer behavior that could result in changes in both total customer deposit balances and deposit balance mix eg interest bearing versus noninterest bearing under the various interest rate scenarios in higher rate scenarios the analysis assumes that a portion of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits are replaced with higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding conversely in lower rate scenarios the analysis assumes that a portion of higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding are replaced with lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits for larger interest rate scenarios the interest rate sensitivity may behave in a nonlinear manner as there are numerous estimates and assumptions which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated that could impact the outcome pertaining to the mortgagebacked securities and residential mortgage portfolio if longend interest rates were to significantly decrease over the next twelve months for example over bps there would generally be an increase in customer prepayment behaviors with an incremental reduction to net interest income noting that the extent of changes in customer prepayment activity can be impacted by multiple factors and is not necessarily limited to longend interest rates conversely if longend interest rates were to significantly increase over the next twelve months for example over bps customer prepayments would likely modestly decrease and result in an incremental increase to net interest income in addition deposit pricing is rate sensitive in nature this sensitivity is assumed to have nonlinear impacts to larger shortend rate movements in decreasing interest rate scenarios and particularly where interest rates have decreased to small amounts the ability to further reduce rates paid is reduced as customer rates near zero in higher shortend rate scenarios deposit pricing will likely increase at a faster rate leading to incremental interest expense and reducing asset sensitivity while the impact related to the above assumptions used in the asset sensitivity analysis can provide directional analysis on how net interest income will be impacted in changing environments the ultimate impact is dependent upon the interrelationship of the assumptions and factors which vary in different macroeconomic scenarios economic value of equity in addition to interest rate sensitivity described above the corporations management of its interest rate exposures in the banking book also considers a longterm view of interest rate sensitivity through the measurement of economic value of equity eve eve captures changes in the net present value of banking book assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios and its impact to tier capital similar to net interest income the corporation establishes limits for eve eve is largely driven by the corporations longer duration fixedrate products such as investment securities residential mortgages and deposits for assets or liabilities that have no stated maturity such as deposits the corporation estimates the duration for measurement purposes interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts we use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our alm activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks specifically we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks our interest rate derivative contracts are generally nonleveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps options futures and forwards and our foreign exchange contracts include crosscurrency interest rate swaps foreign currency futures contracts foreign currency forward contracts and options the derivatives used in our alm activities can be split into two broad categories designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the interest rate risk management for the banking book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in table the corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations by hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations the corporations market risk exposure in this area is not significant risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the corporations nontrading foreign currencydenominated financial instruments these foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as crosscurrency basis spreads and interest rate risk however as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives the market risk related to this exposure is not significant for more information on the accounting for derivatives see note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements bank of america mortgage banking risk management we originate fund and service mortgage loans which subject us to credit liquidity and interest rate risks among others we determine whether loans will be held

operational or reputational harm climaterelated risks are divided into two major categories both of which span across the seven key risk types discussed in the managing risk section in the mda of the corporations annual report on form 10k physical risk risks related to the physical impacts of climate change driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods as well as chronic longerterm shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels and transition risk risks related to the transition to a lowcarbon economy which may entail extensive policy legal technology and market changes physical risks of climate change such as more frequent and severe extreme weather events can increase the corporations risks including credit risk by diminishing borrowers repayment capacity or collateral values and operational risk by negatively impacting the corporations facilities employees or vendors transition risks of climate change may amplify credit risks through the financial impacts of changes in policy technology or the market on the corporation or our counterparties unanticipated market changes can lead to sudden price adjustments and give rise to heightened market risk reputational risk can arise if we do not meet our climaterelated goals or are perceived to be inadequately responsive to climate change our approach to managing climate risk is consistent with our risk management governance structure from senior management to our board and its committees including the erc and the corporate governance esg and sustainability committee cgesc of the board which regularly discuss climaterelated topics the erc oversees climate risk as set forth in our risk framework and risk appetite statement the cgesc is responsible for overseeing the corporations environmental and sustainabilityrelated activities and practices and regularly reviews the corporations climaterelated policies and practices our climate risk council consists of leaders across risk front line unit and control functions and meets routinely to discuss our approach to managing climaterelated risks our climate risk management efforts are overseen by an officer who reports to the chief risk officer the corporation has a climate and environmental risk management function that is responsible for overseeing climate risk management they are responsible for establishing the climate risk framework described below and governance structure and providing an independent assessment of enterprisewide climate risks based on the corporations risk framework in we created our internal climate risk framework which addresses how the corporation identifies measures monitors and controls climate risk by enhancing existing risk management processes and also includes examples of how climate risk manifests across the seven risk types the framework details the roles and responsibilities for climate risk management across our three lines of defense ie front line units global risk management and corporate audit for more information on our governance framework see the managing risk section in the mda of the corporations annual report on form 10k for more
