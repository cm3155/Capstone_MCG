operating performance or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements these nongaap financial measures are not intended as a substitute for gaap financial measures and may not be defined or

for purposes of this calculation we use the federal statutory tax rate of percent and a representative state tax rate net interest yield which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds utilizes net interest income on an fte basis we believe that presentation of these items on an fte basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and taxexempt sources and is consistent with industry practices we may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items eg debit valuation adjustment dva gains losses which result in nongaap financial measures we believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our

tangible equity represents shareholders equity or common shareholders equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets excluding mortgage servicing rights msrs net of related deferred tax liabilities

context of the current rate environment the interest rate scenarios also assume us dollar rates are floored at zero in the three months ended march the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet increased primarily due to decreases in interest rates we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve additionally higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and accordingly for debt securities classified as afs may adversely affect oci and thus capital levels under the basel

change the sensitivity analysis in table assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with

behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the sensitivity analysis in table assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts interest

to the consolidated financial statements of the corporations annual report on form 10k except as noted below under allowance for credit losses there have not been any material updates to our complex accounting estimates as disclosed in the mda of the corporations annual report on form 10k allowance for credit losses on january the corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments to be based on managements best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the corporations relevant financial assets the corporations estimate of lifetime expected credit losses includes the use of quantitative models that incorporate forward looking macroeconomic scenarios that are applied over the contractual life of the loan portfolios adjusted for expected prepayments and borrower controlled extension options these macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses these variables include but are not limited to unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product levels corporate bond spreads and longterm interest rate forecasts as any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain the corporation leverages multiple scenarios the scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events leading economic indicators views of internal as well as thirdparty economists and industry trends the corporation also includes qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but in the corporations assessment may not be adequately represented in the economic assumptions described above for example factors that the corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures business conditions the nature and size of the portfolio portfolio concentrations the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements among others further the corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data the allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio such as increases in risk rating downgrades in our commercial portfolio deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio or increases in ltvs in our consumer real estate portfolio in addition while we have incorporated our estimated impact of covid19 into our allowance for credit losses the ultimate impact of covid19 is still unknown including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses as described above the process to determine the allowance for credit losses requires numerous estimates and assumptions some of which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated changes in the estimates and assumptions can result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is further
