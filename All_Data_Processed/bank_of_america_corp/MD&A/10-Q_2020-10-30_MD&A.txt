a billion pretax impairment charge related to the notice of the termination of the merchant services joint venture in the prior year total assets increased billion from december to trillion primarily driven by an increase in cash and cash equivalents debt securities and federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell primarily due to cash deployed from higher deposit balances the increase in assets was partially offset by lower loans and leases primarily driven by a decline in credit card originations and promotional balances mortgage paydowns and lower origination volumes total liabilities increased billion from december to trillion primarily driven by higher deposit inflows resulting from government stimulus actions and client responses to market volatility as clients improved their liquidity positions the increase in liabilities was also due to higher federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase primarily due to higher inventory in fixed income currencies and commodities ficc within global markets longterm debt also increased primarily driven by valuations due to lower interest rates as well

expense table income tax expense three months ended september nine months ended september  in millions income before income taxes income tax expense effective tax rate the changes in the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended september compared to the same periods a year ago were driven by the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits on the lower levels of pretax income and the impact of the uk tax law change discussed below our recurring tax preference benefits primarily consist of tax credits from investments in affordable housing and renewable energy aligning with our responsible growth strategy to address global sustainability challenges we expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of to be approximately percent excluding unusual items absent these tax credits the effective tax rate would be approximately percent on july the uk enacted a reversal of the final two percent of scheduled decreases in the uk corporation tax rate which had been previously enacted this change will unfavorably affect income tax expense on future uk earnings and requires a reversal of the adjustment to the uk net deferred tax assets recognized at the time the related tax rate decrease was originally enacted accordingly during the third quarter of the corporation recorded a positive income tax adjustment of approximately million along with a corresponding increase to

balances we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve additionally higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and accordingly for debt securities classified as afs may adversely affect oci and thus capital levels under the basel capital rules under instantaneous upward

complex accounting estimates our significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the mda many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities we have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments for more information see complex accounting estimates in the mda of the corporations annual report on form 10k and note summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements of the corporations annual report on form 10k except as noted below under allowance for credit losses there have not been any material updates to our complex accounting estimates as disclosed in the mda of the corporations annual report on form 10k allowance for credit losses on january the corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments to be based on managements best estimate of lifetime ecl inherent in the corporations relevant financial assets the corporations estimate of lifetime ecl includes the use of quantitative models that incorporate forwardlooking macroeconomic scenarios that are applied over the contractual life of the loan portfolios adjusted for expected prepayments and borrowercontrolled extension options these macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses these variables include but are not limited to unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product levels corporate bond spreads and longterm interest rate forecasts as any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain the corporation leverages multiple scenarios the scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events leading economic indicators views of internal and thirdparty economists and industry trends the corporation also includes qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but in the corporations assessment may not be adequately represented in the economic assumptions described above for example factors that the corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures business conditions the nature and size of the portfolio portfolio concentrations the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements among others further the corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data the allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio such as increases in risk rating downgrades in our commercial portfolio deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio or increases in ltvs in our consumer real estate portfolio in addition while we have incorporated our estimated impact of covid19 into our allowance for credit losses the ultimate impact of the pandemic is still unknown including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses as described above the process to determine the allowance for credit losses requires numerous estimates and assumptions some of which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated changes in the estimates and assumptions can result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is further discussed in note summary of significant accounting principles and note outstanding loans and leases and allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements bank of
