the minimum capital requirements see note shareholders equity and note regulatory requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements many of our subsidiaries including our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries resolution planning as a bhc with greater than billion of assets the corporation is required by the federal reserve and the fdic to periodically submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure such resolution plan is intended to be a detailed roadmap for the orderly resolution of the bhc and its material entities pursuant to the us bankruptcy code and other applicable resolution regimes under one or more hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary government assistance if both the federal reserve and the fdic determine that the bhcs plan is not credible the federal reserve and the fdic may jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations a summary of our plan is available on the federal reserve and fdic websites the fdic also requires the submission of a resolution plan for bank of america national association which must describe how the insured depository institution would be resolved under the bank resolution provisions of the federal deposit insurance act a description of this plan is available on the fdics website we continue to make substantial progress to enhance our resolvability including simplifying our legal entity structure and business operations and increasing our preparedness to implement our resolution plan both from a financial and operational standpoint across international jurisdictions resolution planning is the responsibility of national resolution authorities ra among those the jurisdictions of most impact to the corporation are the requirements associated with subsidiaries in the uk ireland and france where rules have been issued requiring the submission of significant information about locallyincorporated subsidiaries including information on intragroup dependencies legal entity separation and barriers to resolution as well as the corporations banking branches located in those jurisdictions that are deemed to be material for resolution planning purposes as a result of the ras review of the submitted information we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years which could increase operating costs and potentially result in the restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries for more information regarding our resolution plan

if it is insolvent or in certain other circumstances in addition under the financial reform act when a systemically important financial institution sifi such as the corporation is in default or danger of default the fdic may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution in the event of such appointment the fdic could among other things invoke the orderly liquidation authority instead of the us bankruptcy code if the secretary of the treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations the orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the federal deposit insurance act but also adopts certain concepts from the us bankruptcy code the orderly liquidation authority contains certain differences from the us bankruptcy code for example in certain circumstances the fdic could permit payment of obligations it determines to be systemically significant eg shortterm creditors or operating creditors in lieu of paying other obligations eg longterm creditors without the need to obtain creditors consent or prior court review the insolvency and resolution process could also lead to a large reduction or total elimination of the value of a bhcs outstanding equity as well as impairment or elimination of certain debt under the fdics single point of entry strategy for resolving sifis the fdic could replace a distressed bhc with a bridge holding company which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank but whose equity is held solely for the benefit of creditors of the original bhc furthermore the federal reserve requires that bhcs maintain minimum levels of longterm debt required to provide adequate loss absorbing capacity in the event of a resolution for more information
