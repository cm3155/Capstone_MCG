end of zerocovid they say policy stimulus from china a continued rise in stock prices elsewhere and more clarity about us interest rates are among the prerequisites for deals to return jpmorgan pnc and bank of america are said to be interested in acquiring the troubled lender after it is seized by the federal deposit insurance corporation federal regulators were racing on saturday to seize and sell the troubled first republic bank before financial markets open on monday according to several people with knowledge of the matter in a bid to put an end to a banking crisis that began last month with the collapse of silicon valley bank the effort led by the federal deposit insurance corporation comes after first republics shares tumbled percent since monday when the bank disclosed that customers had withdrawn more than half of its deposits it became clear this past week that nobody was willing to ride to first republics rescue before a government seizure because larger banks were worried that buying the company would saddle them with billions of dollars in losses the fdic has been talking with banks that include jpmorgan chase pnc financial services and bank of america about a potential deal three of the people said a deal could be announced as soon as sunday these people said cautioning the situation was rapidly evolving and might still change any buyer would most likely assume the deposits of first republic eliminating the need for a government guarantee of deposits in excess of the limit for deposit insurance its possible that an agreement wont be reached in which case the fdic would need to decide if it would seize first republic anyway and take ownership itself in that case federal officials could invoke a systemic risk exception to protect those bigger deposits something they did after the failures of silicon valley bank and signature bank in march the bank regulator started sounding out potential buyers late last week as it became clear that there were few options outside a government takeover one of the people said by friday the fdic asked potential bidders to submit binding offers by sunday this person said those potential bidders have been given access to detailed information on first republics finances one of the people said the people requested anonymity because the process is confidential bloomberg and the wall street journal reported the talks earlier the fdic declined to comment the fdic is working with the financial advisory firm guggenheim partners on the process according to three people with knowledge of the situation regulations preclude jpmorgan chase and bank of america from acquiring another deposittaking bank because of their size and regulators would have to grant an exemption if one of those banks were to acquire first republic progressive democrats were not thrilled about having jpmorgan or bank of america take over the bank given that such a deal would make the already huge institutions larger and that probably tilted things slightly toward pnc another person familiar with the situation said some other smaller regional banks also showed some interest in first republic this person said jpmorgan chase pnc and bank of america were part of a consortium of large banks that temporarily deposited billion into first republic last month as part of an industry effort to prop up the bank but that lifeline did little to put to rest concerns about first republics viability first republic which is based in san francisco and has most of its branches on the coasts where it serves affluent customers who work in industries like technology and finance has been considered the most vulnerable regional bank since the banking crisis began unfolding in march with the sudden collapse of the four biggest us consumer banks by deposits bank of america corp citigroup inc jpmorgan chase and wells fargo co say they run multiple layers of authentication and monitoring tools from the moment users open the app until they log out we have multiple and redundant controls that are not always visible to our end user said tami hudson wells fargos executive vice president and cybersecurity client officer those things really help us to proactively identify login attempts that we would define as risky or potentially risky what the banks do in the past you might have been asked to answer security questions what was the name of your first pet now newer behindthescenes measures take precedence say security experts and banking software providers some compare a users passwordtyping speed and cadence with that persons prior attempts others analyze the pressure with which credentials are entered by checking how many pixels are covered when the user taps each key this melange of authentication practices is found largely in banking apps because the stakes are higher banks know if customers have any concerns about the safety of their money theyll go elsewhere on top of that banks must abide by federal regulations to use secure data management practices such as endtoend encryption all of that weighs on a banks decision to approve a login or transaction said john buzzard lead fraud and security analyst at javelin strategy research which assesses risks in digital banking security if there is a sudden aboutface somewhere theres an opportunity for banks to stop it pause it or request more information he added these tools arent failproof if you have your login credentials stored on your smartphone a phone thief who also knows your passcode may still be able to use autofill to log in but the secret sauce determines how far they go once they get through mr buzzard said even if these defenses are breached and money is stolen more often through victim manipulation than actual hacking the funds are generally protected in other ways too what you can do the four banks we spoke to say protecting users from swindlers means not revealing every tool they have at their disposal still each shared information about its techniques all four support face id and touch id for apple devices and fingerprint signon for android phones biometrics can make signing in easy for you and harder for people who arent you mr buzzard said the apps also automatically log you out after a short period of inactivity there might be other security layers such as transaction alerts twofactor aka twostep authentication and singleuse passwords that you choose to activate banks dont turn everything on by default because they dont want to create too much friction mr buzzard said if you do want to do more here are security options offered by the individual banks bank of america the bank will ask to verify your identity via twofactor at various times like when youre making a transfer or using an unrecognized device but you can have it prompt with a code via text or email every time you log in on the mobile app find the tool in the banks security center which has a checklist detailing other ways to improve your accounts security
