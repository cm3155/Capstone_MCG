from him in a minute so just stepping back on the cover slide today we reported billion in aftertax net income or per diluted share thats up significantly from the yearago period this quarter was a repeat of the themes we discussed with you in the last few quarters the prepandemic organic growth engine that is bank of america is fully back in place and producing success we had strong organic and responsible growth across all our businesses we grew revenue and produced positive operating leverage we continue to see very strong asset quality metrics we support our clients in their need for capital and weve made further progress in support of local community efforts across all our markets i want to congratulate importantly and thank our teammates around the globe for all the great work they did in that enable us to deliver for our clients our team our shareholders and our communities lets go to start on slide and a few comments about our full year results this quarter capped a record year of billion in earnings for and represented significant growth in net income over we even saw a more significant growth in eps as share count dropped we generated more than billion of earnings in every quarter in revenue grew yearoveryear and activity gained momentum throughout the year nii grew well in the second half of the year which complemented fee growth especially in our marketsrelated businesses wealth management investment banking and sales and trading revenues were all strong in pausing in nii recall that in the first quarter we noted at the time that our expectation is that quarterly nii could progress up by billion per quarter as we entered the fourth quarter and in fact we have recorded fourth quarter nii that is billion or better than first quarter bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 our teams managed well through the rate volatility and we grew loans and deposits with our customer as the year progressed that sets us up nicely for and alastair is going to talk about that in a minute expense was well managed but expense did go up as we continue to invest for growth thats axiomatic our covidrelated costs remained elevated and revenuerelated costs grew so while we did not see full year operating leverage we did however return to strong operating leverage in each of the last two quarters of the year restarting our streak that we had before the pandemic credit remained stellar through chargeoffs consistently improved each quarter our commitment to responsible growth remains well placed we are growing faster than the market and keeping credit costs in check the economic improvement and our strong credit allowed us to release much of the reserves we built in when you look at the balance sheet we grew deposits billion in that was on top of the billion of growth we had in our loan growth accelerated throughout the year fourth quarter represented the strongest quarter of organic loan growth we have experienced at bank of america now of course thats absent the first quarter at the start of covid which had billion of panic drawdowns in a few weeks at the end of the day we produced strong roa and a rotce for you our shareholders and we returned billion in capital during the year lets go to slide the best way to highlight the drivers behind the earnings success is to look at the momentum and client activity across the businesses this shows organic growth engine is running hard more and more of this client activity is powered by our digital transformation which is foundational to everything we do we are proud of our digital stats and continue to spotlight our results later in the materials as usual see pages to but some key stats on this page consumers logged into our digital channels more than billion times in the fourth quarter alone erica our digital financial assistant completed more than million requests from our clients in the year half our consumer sales were digital in the fourth quarter of all the check deposit transactions are now digital customers used zelle to transfer billion in the most recent quarter the number of zelle transactions now surpasses the checks written by our consumers cashpro approvals by our commercial and corporate clients to move money grew since the pandemic so the digital journey continues and that supercharges our relationship managerdriven model and together that has driven the growth on loans and deposits and fees net new checking accounts have grown in each of the past quarters this contributes to the continued growth in our core deposits this also demonstrates the extent of our leadership position with us consumers in deposits we have trillion in deposits from all american consumers on credit cards at roughly million new accounts in the fourth quarter alone thats now operating at the same level of new card production as it was prepandemic were going to continue to drive that opportunity when you think about consumer investments merrill edge as we call it we opened new accounts in the year those accounts carried renew at opening in balances for each of those accounts this demonstrates the deep penetration of the mass affluent customer base of america sales of bank products in both merrill and our private bank teams have remained strong now when you combine merrill the private bank and consumer investments theyve produced more than billion in net client flows in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 in global banking we had record years of investment banking fees combined with the strong gts results in global markets we saw record equity sales and trading revenue these are just a few examples of the types of client activity that are driving market share gains for our company as ive done in the past i want to spend a few minutes on the broader economy and ill use our own customer data to make a few points lets go to slide first on consumer spending id offer a few thoughts we are a provider of choice for individuals and businesses when paying for goods and services our awardwinning and easeofuse capabilities across all forms help clients budget save spend and borrow carefully and confidently we look at all forms of consumer spending including ach wires billpay p2p cash and checks many firms and many people discuss credit and debit spending but as you look at the chart on the lower lefthand side of page you can see that of the money moves in other form so what happened in well consumers spent record amounts and for context i am comparing against the prepandemic period of and you can see that in the upper charts on both sides of the page bank of americas million clients made trillion in total payments during that was an increase of over prepandemic levels an alltime high fourth quarter and december payments also reached record highs fourth quarter payments were up over and december payments were up over these are the dollar volume payments but likewise the numbers of payments were up double digits also showing more and more activity just focusing on debit and credit spending for the holiday period of november and december spending was up over this data confirms that consumers continue to spend into the holiday season and so far this year that strength continues for all the spending of all types through january we have seen it up over versus the start of which is well up over and that bodes well for the rest of the year and quarter focusing on the channels of payment in the lower righthand chart as youd expect cash and check volumes are down for compared to this simply means more and more customers are using our digital capabilities to achieve their goals each year now importantly though this allows us to grow our consumer business with lower cost we believe theres lots of potential spending capacity left as average deposit balances continue to move up through the end of the year despite the heavy spending you see we had one segment one cohort of deposits that dipped for one month over the last part of the year in november we had a small dip in customers who had or less in their balances prepandemic they dipped by other than that every cohort from june july august september october november and december all grew every month and whats striking is that the balances for people who had less than average balances before the pandemic theyre now sitting with five times the balances they had prepandemic for those customers that had in accounts before the pandemic theyre now sitting with two times in their accounts the teams track this data carefully and it shows the spending power left in the american consumer another economic signpost worth noting through our customer activity was the acceleration of loan growth in the fourth quarter earlier last year we talked about the green shoots of loan growth we saw in the first quarter and we saw that turn into growth as we moved through the quarters culminating with billion in record loan growth bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 this quarter we note these borrowers both consumer and commercial have strong capacity to continue to borrow if they so desire as line as lines across the border and low usage status we provide slide to show you the daily outstanding loans again this quarter which gives you a sense of progression across time every loan category saw improvement this quarter except for home equity what i would draw your attention to on slide is the addition of the prepandemic starting points to give you some reference while some of the growth this quarter was in global markets and that business ebbs and flows with the market activity billion of that billion was in the core consumer and commercial books so far in january the businesses other than global markets continue to show growth over the end of the year so lets start and talk about the commercial portfolio where we have moved above the prepandemic level with the most recent growth commercial loans excluding ppp grew billion or linkedquarter compared to quarter three growth this quarter was broadbased across all segments of commercial lending we saw improvement in both new loans as well as improved utilization from existing clients this reflects the intense relationship manager effort our teams have done across the last couple years and adding more and more relationship managers commercial loans of wealth management clients extended their growth trend this quarter as these customers borrowed for various liquidity needs for asset purchases in small business lending the allimportant small business segment lending activity is running consistently above prepandemic levels and especially in our practice solutions group that supports medical dental and veterinary practices we continue to see continued momentum and finished one of the best years across all small business with our business advantage rewards cards turning to consumer loans card loans grew billion or from quarter three levels this occurred as spending increased and even occurred as payment rates paying off the card completely trended higher for the quarter card balances still remain well below the prepandemic levels of billion and we continue to push that opportunity mortgage loan levels grew linkedquarter as origination remain at high levels and paydown slowed down on the next slide i would say that while we delivered capital back to our shareholders billion and we invest in our teammates we also continued to invest in our communities through our local teams across the country focused on our markets i call out the reference in the bottom middle of slide to the sweeping changes we announced last week in our nsf policies these updates continue the work we began over a decade ago to simplify our product set and allow a great experience for our clients and an efficient capability for our operations eliminating nsf fees and reducing the overdraft charge per occurrence from to and the other changes were making is a big win for our clients its going to have an obvious impact on those fees which have fallen dramatically since and but currently run about billion in and wed expect them to drop by over the next year or so with that let me turn it over to alastair bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 alastair borthwick chief financial officer bank of america corp thank you brian and good morning everyone im going to take us to our fourth quarter results on slide focusing on comparisons against the prioryear quarter and ill also talk to the highlevel commentary on slide as brian noted we produced billion in net income which grew from fourth quarter while earnings per share of improved at a faster pace due to our share repurchases looking at our top line improvement on a yearoveryear basis revenue rose the improvement was driven by a billion increase in nii and a little more than million increase in noninterest income each business segment produced strong noninterest income results and as you look at significant components of revenue it was pretty consistent through the quarters in one important aspect of responsible growth has been to grow consistently and sustainably and i think we executed on that in with investment banking over billion each quarter sales and trading near or above billion each quarter investment and brokerage services revenue over billion each quarter with regard to expenses our revenuerelated costs increased and we continued to make investments in our people and our capabilities to grow the franchise at the same time lower covid19 costs and further digital engagement have helped to offset some of those increases in the fourth quarter revenue growth outpaced expense growth on a yearoveryear basis which produced operating leverage of basis points and a yearoveryear improvement in pretax preprovision income to billion with regard to returns our rotce was roa was basis points both of which improved nicely over the year moving to slide during the quarter the balance sheet grew billion to a little less than trillion and this reflected the billion of growth in deposits these deposits funded billion of loans growth and we also added billion in securities and saw our cash increase by billion partially offsetting these increases were typical yearend moves in our global markets balance sheet our liquidity portfolio grew to trillion or a little more than a third of our balance sheet and shareholders equity declined billion from  driven by the billion of capital distributions which once again outpaced earnings in the fourth quarter as it did in  with regard to our regulatory ratios cet1 under the standardized approach was and remains well above our minimum requirement the cet1 ratio declined basis points from  driven by excess capital reduction as well as an increase in our rwa due to the strong loans growth and were happy to see that capital usage increasingly needed to support customers and to fuel their growth while still producing plenty of capital to return to our shareholders earnings alone in the most recent quarter contributed basis points to our cet1 ratio before the other capital impacts of share repurchase given our deposit growth our supplemental leverage ratio declined to versus a minimum requirement of which still leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth and our tlac ratio remained comfortably above our requirements bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 turning to slide we included the schedule on average loan balances but in the interest of time i dont have anything to add beyond what brian noted earlier moving to deposits on slide we continued to see significant growth across the client base as we deepened relationships and added net new accounts across our deposittaking businesses combining both consumer and wealth management customer balances i would highlight that retail deposits grew billion from  our retail deposits have now grown to nearly trillion and we lead all competitors we also saw continued strong growth with our commercial clients and remember the deposits were focused on and are gathering are the operational deposits of our customers in both consumer and wholesale turning to slide and net interest income on a gaap nonfte basis nii in  was billion but i know as investors you tend to focus on the fte nii number which was billion so focusing on the change on an fte basis net interest income increased billion from  or driven by deposit growth and related investing of liquidity nii versus  of was up million driven by deposit growth and then higher securities levels as well as loans growth premium amortization declined roughly million to billion in  and the positive nii impact of lower premium amortization offset lower ppp fees given continued deposit growth and low rates our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains significant its modestly lower quarteroverquarter as long end rates moved higher and we recognized some of that sensitivity in our now higher reported level of nii so id like to give you a couple thoughts on nii expectations for first i want to start by reiterating pauls comment last quarter that we expect to see robust nii growth in compared to that assumes we see continued loans growth and the rising rates expectations embedded in the forward curve and in the first quarter specifically we expect two headwinds first there are two less interest accrual days in the quarter and as a reminder we picked those back up in the subsequent two quarters second we expect less ppp fee benefits combined those two headwinds add to about million despite those headwinds we would still expect  to be up about couple hundred million from  and should grow nicely each subsequent quarter in again thats of course dependent upon the realization of the forward curve and some loans growth lastly as we see the forward curve now expecting a new rate hiking cycle to begin we added slide as we thought it might be helpful from a historical context to see the trend of nii across the years since the last rate hike cycle and what i want to draw your attention to is the stark difference in the size of our balance sheet today and because of that balance sheet differential todays nii is already at the nii level we saw when we were well into the middle of the last rate cycle and importantly our short end asset sensitivity today is twice what it was in the third quarter of as that cycle began okay lets turn to costs and well use slide for that discussion our  expenses were billion an increase of million from  higher revenuerelated costs and to a lesser degree seasonally higher marketing costs drove the increase as brian noted at a midquarter conference our  expenses were a bit higher than we anticipated when we ended the last quarter bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 revenue continue to hold up well and the company had a good year both resulting then in higher incentive costs compared to the yearago period expense growth was driven by incentive costs associated with all of our marketsrelated improvements as we look forward we continue to invest in technology and people at a high rate across our businesses and we continue to add new financial centers in expansion and growth markets so let me say two things about expenses first relative to  expense we expect  to include two elements of seasonality we typically experience seasonally higher payroll tax expense and that was about million in also  is typically our best period of sales and trading revenue which results in modestly higher associated costs second with regard to full year our best expectation currently is we can hold expenses flat compared to which finished just below billion this guidance incorporates our expected continuing investments strong revenue performance and the inflationary costs we experienced in the second half of it also relies upon our continued expense discipline operational excellence improvements and the benefits of digital transformation to deliver the operating leverage we seek turning to asset quality on slide the asset quality of our customers remains very healthy and net chargeoffs this quarter fell to a historical low of million or basis points of average loans they continued a steady decline through the quarters of with  down million from  and down more than million from  last year our credit card loss rate was and thats less than half of the prepandemic rate it improved each quarter during the year several other loan product categories have been in recovery positions throughout the year provision was a million net benefit in  driven primarily by asset quality and macroeconomic improvement and was partially offset by loans growth this included a reserve release of million primarily in our commercial portfolio and on slide we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios turning to the business segments lets start with consumer banking on slide ill start by acknowledging what a strong year the consumer bank has had as they generated nearly billion of earnings which is of record year results for the company consumer opened over net new checking accounts and in fact this quarter represents their 12th consecutive quarter of net new consumer checking account growth and in turn consumer grew deposits by more than billion they opened million credit cards and grew card accounts in by more than any of the past four years this helped card balances grow in  despite payments remaining high they also opened new consumer investment accounts and that helped us to reach a new record for investment balances of billion growing yearoveryear as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering yes market valuations grew balances and we also saw billion of client flows since  bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 so  was a strong finish to these results and in the quarter the business produced billion of earnings of billion of revenue and managed costs well our revenue growth was led by nii improvement as we continued to recognize more of the value of our deposit book and while revenue grew expense declined by yearoveryear generating over basis points of operating leverage lower covid costs and increased digital adoption by clients more than offset our continued investments in people and our franchise this expense discipline has now driven our cost of deposits to an industryleading basis points net chargeoffs declined and we had million of reserve release in the quarter and as you can see and as i already noted deposits continued to grow strongly both yearoveryear as well as linkedquarter importantly our rate paid remained low and stable turning to the wealth management business bank of america continued to deliver wealth management at scale across a full range of client segments the continued economic progress strong market conditions and the efforts of our advisors contributed to strong client flows and net new household growth this allowed wealth management to generate more than billion in earnings in up more than from in  this powerful combination of merrill lynch and our private bank produced records for revenue earnings investment balances and asset management fees as well as record levels of loans and deposits in fact with regard to loans this is the 47th consecutive quarter of average loans growth in the business its consistent and its sustained  net income was billion improving yearoveryear and driven by strong revenue growth good expense controls and lower credit costs revenue growth of was led by strong improvements in both aum and brokerage fees as well as higher nii on the back of solid loan and deposit increases expenses increased in alignment with the higher revenue and resulted in basis points of operating leverage client balances of trillion rose billion up yearoveryear driven by higher market levels as well as very strong net client flows of billion within these flows deposits grew billion yearoveryear to billion and loans grew billion yearover year to billion and that loan and deposit growth is further evidence that more and more merrill and private bank clients are using the banks products broadly net new household generation is getting closer to prepandemic levels as advisors are meeting in person more with clients and are building their pipelines back following the shut down during the pandemic this quarter merrill lynch net new households of and private banking relationships net new of were both up more than from the yearago period the clients of this business continue to lead our franchise in digital adoption utilizing digital tools to access their investments and also for other banking needs like mobile check deposits and lending the evolution is forming a modern merrill which is advisorled and powered by digital moving to global banking on slide the business momentum through the back half of the year was strong net interest income grew on the back of accelerating loans growth investment banking fees reached record levels and deposits continued to grow as clients navigated the pandemic bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 we also straw strong demand from our clients around esg investments driving improvements in bottom line results net income for the full year was a record billion or of the companys overall net income the business earned billion in  improving nearly billion yearoveryear driven by higher revenue and lower provision costs partially offset by higher expenses revenue improvement of yearoveryear reflected more than growth in investment banking fees in this segment and net interest income increased this investment banking performance allowed us to gain market share and record number three ranking in overall fees in what was a very strong  market we ranked number one in investmentgrade and number two in leverage finance with market share improvement compared to the yearago period and we also saw another record ma period and most importantly our investment banking pipeline remains quite healthy provision expense reflected a reserve release of million compared to a million release in the yearago period and what id draw your attention to here is the reduction in net chargeoffs yearoveryear from million in  of to small recoveries in  that yearago period included some losses from clients and those industries that were heavily impacted by covid finally given the strength of revenue we saw expenses increase by which was still only half of our increase in revenue switching to global markets on slide full year net income of billion reflects another solid year of sales and trading revenue this included a record year for equities up versus investments made in this part of the business are seeing good results as our financing clients are doing more business with our company as we usually do ill talk about the segment results excluding dva even though net dva was negligible in both  and  in  global markets produced million in earnings million lower than the yearago quarter focusing on yearoveryear revenue was modestly down driven by sales and trading sales and trading contributed billion to revenue a decline of yearoveryear ficc down while equities improved ficc results reflect a weaker credittrading environment in  and the strength in equities was driven by growth in client financing activities and the multiplier effect the yearoveryear expense move was driven by investments and revenuerelated sales and trading costs partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the realignment of a liquidating business activity to the all other units in  finally on slide we show all other which reported a loss of million which declined a little more than million from the yearago period revenue declined as a result of higher volume of deals particularly solar and partnership losses on esg investments thats offset by the tax impact in this reporting unit expense increased as a result of costs now recorded here after the fourth quarter realignment out of global markets which was partially offset by decrease in various other expenses in the segment that realignment obviously had no bottom line impact on our company overall bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 as a reminder for the financial statement presentation in this release the business segments are all taxed on the standard fully taxableequivalent basis and in all other we incorporate the impact of our esg tax credits and any other unusual items for the full year the effective tax rate was and excluding the second quarter positive tax adjustment triggered by the uk tax law change and other discrete items the tax rate would have been further adjusting for esg tax credits our tax rate would have been and looking forward we would expect our effective tax rate in to be between and absent any tax law changes or unusual items and with that i think ill stop and well open it up for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question today comes from glenn schorr with evercore your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay thank you ill try to ask this as easy as possible but in the wave of a couple of other companies in the space talking a lot about comp inflation and steppedup investments i think a lot of shareholders would love to see and hear your comments about all else equal flattish expenses in and so the simple enough question is how do people take comfort to know that youre making all the right investments to continue to compete and take share and migrate digitally like you have been doing but were seeing so much competition across all your business lines so just looking for some warm fuzzy blanket words of encouragement thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well ill just start glenn by reiterating what you just said you said were taking market share so id say weve sustained our technology investments all the way through the pandemic weve sustained our financial center renovations weve sustained our marketing weve sustained our investment and relationship managers and the result of that is in many cases record client experience and you can see i think in our numbers that we are doing more business with our existing clients were adding net new clients and were growing market share and were getting thirdparty recognition as well so i think its results is how you will judge us on the technology but were obviously very competitive in that regard brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so glenn let me just throw a couple of things one obviously its axiomatic that revenue from marketsrelated business whether its in wealth management or investment banking teammates or its in the markets business so jimmy demare and matthew koder and andy and katie have done great jobs and thats a given theyre going to go up and you see that those numbers are up dramatically over the last couple years as markets have raised but you invest a lot of ways bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 so well never have the temerity to say that we know every possible competitive thing that could happen over the next decade in this company but if you look across history which is what alastair is referring to weve invested in new technology development billion to billion year after year after year and we tend to invest in things that work and then drive them and scale them and so you see that if you look at pages and just start to think about what we said earlier zelle is more transaction count than checks written think about that change think about the change in the branches that basically in our expense guidance well open new branches this year on top of the and some weve opened in the last three years but importantly we shifted from other places in that we brought branch count overall down as weve been doing that that means were opening up new markets gaining market share as alastair said and using the expense base in others and then in our broadbased teammates we basically have gone to an hour our attrition rates are similar to where they were in which was a 10year low so think about weve invested heavily weve invested broad based but youre seeing the activities going and if you start to think about the retail deposits per branch there are multiples of other people so you think about the we have branches we have trillion in consumer deposits and billion in wealth management deposits so that operating leverage is what we do so were an operating leverage company were not a cost takeout company anymore we havent been but we see the path forward of flat expenses next year and frankly there was a lot of onetime stuff that went through the last couple years that is coming to an end and that well reposition that to help pay for the types of things revenuerelated growth and investments that we think are important but just look at those stats and see what weve done and i think that thats where we get the confidence glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc well said all right ill leave it at that thanks very much operator the next question comes from john mcdonald with autonomous research your line is open john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research morning alastair i was wondering if you could unpack the outlook for robust net interest income growth in kind of wondering what kind of loan growth assumptions are you building in for the year and how do liquidity deployment and premium amortization assumptions also factor in to your outlook alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp okay so lets start with loans growth were pretty optimistic on loans growth you can see on slide just the consistency thats daily you can see the consistency of the growth its broadbased across all the businesses as brian noted and obviously its accelerated recently the thing i find interesting about slide is youve really got to adjust for the size of the economy today relative to where our loans were in prepandemic so we know theres some potential for catch up there and we can see that in our data too john our revolver utilization rates are still lower than historic levels so we feel like theres some potential there and in things like card payment rates are still elevated bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 so theres a variety of things there that make us feel good about loans growth certainly more bullish than we might have been in a prepandemic gdp type to kind of environment so were pretty optimistic on loans i think you need to think about that in sort of highsingle digits and then when it comes to you can see when we put forth our asset sensitivity numbers that billion for a parallel shock is meant to give you an idea of how we believe were levered to rates id say about of that is probably the short end probably is the long end with things like premium amortization and thats probably how id break it down john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then as a followup can you talk a little bit about how youre managing to your capital minimums what kind of cushion do you want to keep to the slr just remind us the target on cet1 and how do buybacks which it seems like youve accelerated in the back half of how does that factor into the overall calculation of managing growth and capital thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp sure john if you go back john for many years in our discussions weve had excess capital despite the many ways that the capital process increased the capital requirements for large companies like ours including the introduction of the gsifi buffer et cetera et cetera and then the stress testing and slr et cetera so weve always said wed maintain basis points to basis points of cushion were now getting closer to that but the reality is that we are seeing the kind of organic growth that is what you want us to see investing in the client franchise whether its in the markets business of having more balance sheet deployed and seeing that pick up and having a record amount of revenues whether its the deposit growth that were now at trillion of deposits and trillion in loans and it is growing well so expect us to have a different equation which is well still pay out dividends up to like we said we used to say the other would come back to you now there would be some for organic growth if in fact we get down to the levels and the rest will be repurchased on a quarterly basis but at an earnings rate of billion theres a lot of capital deployment even embedded in that john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks brian operator well go next to mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i guess first brian and then alastair you talk about the benefit of higher rates but i think for you and the industry its the benefit of better relationships to the extent that relationships are sticky as rates increase so if you can just give some metrics around retention and then specifically last year you gave an nii guide of billion higher can you give us some sense where you expect nii to be from to thanks bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think on your very last point alastair gave you the starting point and gave you robust strong enough well because itll depend a little bit on the path forward were billion of rate sensitivity a 100basispoint increase as we said so well let you figure out when those rate changes come through backing up to your broader point mike at the end of the day in the consumer business what drives our capabilities there is the preferred group of customers that are 80plus of the balances and retention rate through preferred rewards and the millions of people we have in it is 99plus and those customers have tremendous relationship with us and we invest across whether its the preferred rewards as you know go across the whole business and not just byproduct so those customers get rewards in credit cards that they pay for by giving us deposits you go to wealth management if you look at the stats you can see the strong growth not only in what youd expect in the aum side but the client flows in deposits and other products as we continue to drive the core deep relationship across in the private bank but importantly in merrill across all different segments and even as we enter new markets where we didnt have banking capabilities columbus ohio for example there was robust merrill capability as were building underneath so that relationship and if you move to the commercial side its the same thing so our deposits in commercial are strong they are all operating deposits its a lions share of them they are part of what we at core do but they build off the backs of that great relationship management practice and the gts capabilities of which weve invested billions of dollars and across last things and what seals that all together is not that these are indiscernible group of enterprises that go off and operate it is the common things that they have together which are things like the digital capabilities which would give you the capabilities that backbone goes across all our customer sets and that enables us to drive it and also how they work together in the markets we will set a record in we ended up getting back to where we were in referrals from one business to the other in every market and those are important ways that we cement a relationship our commercial banking investments group as we call it has millions of customers through our corporate relationships that have priority access so it is about how you build the franchise and concentrating on eight lines of business and how they work together our merchant sales are back way over where they were when we had the joint venture our 401k engagements are way up and again thats going through the franchise so we feel good about the relationship side and if thats your point mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well brian assuming you get billion of benefits arent you tempted to take some of that and spend more because it seems like youre letting that fall to the bottom line what are your considerations when you say well let that fall to the bottom line instead of making additional investments and also what do you think about expenses say in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well i think were flat next year mike if you remember back leading in the pandemic we had i think quarters of operating leverage in a row but were starting to make the turn from expenses going down and then flattening that were going to have to start growing again to allow for the rate of investments and compensating our teammates well et cetera and so we feel that that rate of investment is embedded in the run rate and would we start to grow expenses at some point i think that will be based on really some of the market related revenue and incentives that drive it but we still have a lot of room to go on a daytoday basis and cost takeout in this company and then reinvesting that in opex and stuff it is think about that check two years less checks going through the system thats by driving those capabilities allows us to be more efficient so itll go to the bottom line because frankly most of that value comes off the consumer franchise which has been investing heavily in whether its merrill edge whether its the card business whether its the rewards which are a huge investment in our client base meaning that as charges go up and the revenue doesnt go up as much thats actually investment and whether its the branches and the new branches new markets and then but dean and the team have been experts at repositioning the expense base for more efficient execution mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so do we start counting again the number of quarters in a row that your achieve positive outcome youre at two are you trying to break that 20quarter record or brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well were at two so weve got some room to go so were working on it mike and well keep plugging away but you know us we know how to manage expenses in this company i wouldnt be here if we didnt think we could do it the right way and invest so i think people should be confident that we count heads were down people in the quarter and the year from to and all those people are going to make more money because theyve had a fabulous year but the reality is we keep managing the overall human count down which is our biggest cost mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thanks mike operator well go now to jim mitchell with seaport global your line is open jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 hey good morning maybe a question on credit i think were all sort of ignoring that now but youve seen your alltime low net chargeoffs particularly in the card business i think the consensus is that well see a normalization process in the back half of this year and into to but were not seeing any change really in delinquencies are you in that camp that were going to see normalization what are the drivers of that or is there some sort of behavior mix change among customers that maybe we can be a little bit more optimistic on chargeoffs over the next months alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well jim were seeing the same thing you are so when were looking at our days past or days past or days past theyre staying at those same low levels you talked about when brian talked about customer balances being elevated in some cases up five times where they were prepandemic thats probably whats accounting for a lot of the consumer credit quality improvement were anticipating at some point it will go back towards more normal historical levels we just think its going to bump around here for a little while so we dont have a particular timeline on that at this point but im not sure wed be betting on behavioral change jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities okay thanks for that and then just as a followup on the wealth management business theres nice acceleration in new households and deposit growth and net flows but even as fa head count kind of trickles down i guess how are you improving productivity there and do you see a time where you start to see net fa head count grow to kind of accelerate that growth brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah jim if you look at the quarterbyquarter progression on that in the supplement or something you could see its starting to flatten out a lot of that adjustment in the recent past has been due to the work that dean and andy did with aron levine and others on their combined training program so were training we had two training programs running et cetera we combined all that and so that now has sort of stabilized and so youd expect us to see slow growth out for the merrill edge customer its largely a digital execution and thats where the real growth comes from and thats sort of infinitely leverageable that balance is there billionplus new customers growing well and for merrill and the private bank it is people and youll see that flatten out come up but that had largely to do with the repositioning of the training program that the team has accomplished and so now we train one set of advisors they have different career paths in our company but it makes us more efficient going to the ability to keep managing expenses and so youre seeing good household formation the marginal productivity of our advisors is through the roof and you can see that but the reality is you want to have the growth and flows and that billion for the year is a pretty substantial increase over any year past i think its either twice or almost three times so we feel good about it and a year when remember you still could meet facetoface with your clients a lot its not the easiest year to develop business too so the team did a great job bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities no absolutely thanks brian operator well go now to erika najarian with ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes hi i just wanted to ask alastair a followup question on nii in that billion number what kind of deposit repricing is embedded in your sensitivity and as you look at potential actual performance for the year as opposed to the sensitivity how should we expect total deposits to trend in terms of growth or attrition and also re pricing alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp okay so obviously it feels like right now were at the beginning of a new rate hike cycle and so were looking back towards to as the most recent rate hike cycle during that period erica we had deposit base of probably between and somewhere in the middle of that wed like to think this time around itll be something similar hopefully a little bit better based on what weve learned and based on the value we add to our customers and then in terms of deposit growth we have deposit growth moderating back towards more normal growth over time just recognizing were coming off of two years of extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc just to confirm given the deposit growth that youre seeing you mentioned that most of your growth is concentrated in operating accounts you dont expect declines in deposits as rates rise brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp we didnt see it last time from to we saw or weve continued to grow deposits better than the industry and they grew throughout that period of time and so because of the nature of what they are we get the economists to go through all the drawing of the things and because of some of the offbalance sheet financing that fed has put together but this is a strict matter last time we did not see deposits go down as the feds balance sheet shrank by from trillion or whatever the peak was down to around trillion erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just taking a step back this question is for brian brian one of your closest peers jpmorgan sort of gave a mediumterm rotce target of about and as you think about bofa over the next few years and you think about normalizing rates your comment about selffunding the investments a much bigger balance sheet i dont think weve seen highsingle digits growth in quite some time as we put all of that together what will you tell your investors what your rotce mediumterm target would be in a normalized rate environment bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp weve always said that our job is to keep that well in excess of our cost of capital and weve done it and i think again because of the leverage and rate increases instantaneous impact to business like the consumer business which doesnt need any more capital to grow we feel good about it but we have focused people on that will continue to grow the earnings at returns that are we used to say to now id say and well continue to do that but we need to balance the broad nominal returns of the growth and last year we had good rotce and we expect to maintain that erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator the next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi you made some significant announcements on overdraft nsf and i think you framed the drop versus if i remember correctly i guess how much would we be modelling if that goes down in the next couple of years say versus the level and then also remind us what else is in service charges i think you have a bunch of commercial fees and theres always some confusion that comes of what that is alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so lets start with nsfod what brians outlined is we think theres about billion in there coming down over time probably around of that this year just to give you some idea obviously were making those changes as we update systems and processes et cetera so thats some in february some in may i think lee and his team can help you with timing but that gives you a ballpark to try to think about that and then you just asked me the service charges just explain that one more time matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah i think a lot of investors look at service charges and think its all consumer but i think theres a lot of commercial fees in there too and just what exactly are those and remind us like how those react as interest rates go up brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah so those are the gts fees so global transaction services so people can pay us cash fees or they can pay us with balances at which we get the earnings rate and we give them a credit as you well know so generally when rates go up the dollar value of the earnings credit goes up and therefore people shift a little bit to that so lee could take you through some of the dynamics but yes therell be pressure on that fee line but well be earning money a different way believe me all in you make a lot of money and its different for largest companies bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 versus small businesses and things like that so its a complex thing and it also comes back to the deposit betas in the commercial business that alastair referenced earlier also in that fee line is monthly maintenance fees for accounts on both the commercial small business and consumer side theres other things in there but the nsf is the one that in od we wanted to focus on which we gave you about billion and change and its down other than that it ought to bounce around and kind of go up or down a little bit but i wouldnt be too overly worried about the other pieces matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then just a quick clarification question alastair you mentioned about highsingle digit loan growth in was that on a full year kind of average basis or period end or how would you frame that alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah id say thats kind of a full year kind of a growth rate average and i would just say its early in the year but i guess what were trying to impress upon you is were pretty optimistic based on everything weve seen matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator well take our next question from ken usdin with jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning just wanted to followup on the rate sensitivity and the nii outlook obviously what you gave us in the billion is the banking book can you help us just understand the rest of the balance sheet the institutional part thats i think historically more liability sensitive whats the best way of us trying to understand like how that nets out in terms of the true underlying benefit from rates as we move higher overall for the balance sheet alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so wed say our markets business generally speaking is pretty liability sensitive so the short end will have a modest impact negatively on us and then its liability it works in our favor on the long end so obviously when were carrying things short longer assets we end up making some money there so its probably a few hundred million negative at the short end over a 12month period its probably a couple hundred million positive at the long end over a 12month period but thats ballpark how to think about it ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc so its really not a meaningful net down impact then alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 no not compared to our asset sensitivity part of the franchise is liability price and sensitive deposits ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah yeah okay and on that second point about the deposits growth is just outstanding and you mentioned earlier that its good to see the good stuff growing but you are getting tighter on your slr and your cet1 versus your targets so as you go forward would you consider issuing more prefs to keep that buffer free or is it more that you just let the balance sheet grow and take the rwas at the tradeoff of a lower buyback alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so ill talk about the slr i think brian talked about cet and buyback earlier but obviously with slr weve got a couple of different levers there one is prefs as you saw in fourth quarter we issued billion in pref which obviously gets some more balance sheet flexibility where we need it and when we need it and look id just say when we have customers coming in here about to establish a relationship with us for the course of the next years or in the case of commercial clients for the next decades were going to make sure that were in a position to take their deposits and establish that relationship for the longterm ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah thats exactly why i asked okay thank you very much operator well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc alastair a question just as we think about securities reinvestment in this rising rate environment should we think about you trying to keep pace with where the yields are today and shortening the duration of the book which reduces potential aoci risk or should we anticipate that you would be more likely to keep duration where it is and benefit from a yield pickup as rates rise alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so id say with respect to our securities reinvestment right now were finding that weve got the kind of loans growth that we want to see generally speaking its obviously wed come off a period where we didnt see that loans growth so with the excess liquidity we were in a position where were looking primarily and first add securities now were moving more towards loans bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 so if you looked at this last quarter we added billion of loans we added billion in securities now were obviously going to be careful with respect to the oci impact and when you look at our balance sheet youll see most of the securities in availableforsale are treasury swap to floating so thats going to have obviously a pretty substantial offsetting effect to anything that happens with higher rates and then im not sure were going to necessarily change our duration profile around the securities portfolio i believe a lot of that rolling off every quarter and then we tend to just put more back in the stack over time so with any luck well continue to see the loans growth thatll be our primary focus betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay no thats great very helpful thank you and then brian i know we talked a lot about reinvestment in the franchise and the platform i wanted to ask that question from a slightly different angle obviously were all very well aware of fintech competition and whats going on technologically speaking that enables not only competitors in the banking space but nonbanking space to be more active in finance when you think about your current platform is it at the end state that you want or is there more to do with regard to leveraging cloud and ai to enhance the efficiency of the organization overall or maybe thats not even a potential outcome of shifting the technology maybe theres something else im not thinking about brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think ais different than cloud our internal clouds what we do with external has largely to do with cost flexibility security what applications that were running and how do we do that but security and the ability to integrate it and the ability to be never down on things like that are high on our minds put that aside the ability to continue to improve our platform is infinite and you see it i mean you couldve asked me this question two quarters ago and you wouldve had if you look at the pages in to look at the statistics from two quarters ago and what drives these changes is things like erica going from million users to million users and million interactions to million fourth quarter last year to fourth quarter this year is because of the feature functionality and capabilities of it go up our life plans million people i think are using them they have more balances because of what theyre doing so well never be at end state and thats where were continuing to drive investment digital sales capabilities were only starting to be able to take full advantage of it frankly across the platform because you had to get end to end you had to get it all knocked together and its kind of interesting because its growing quickly now so small business capabilities to whole merchant services we finally got our new platform out at a cost of million its now being sold those are major investments so the question is do we appeal and we open twice the population rate for people between the ages of and in terms of new accounts we seem to be gaining share in that segment and the usage by that segment is high and so we feel very good that our platforms obviously appeal to every cohort of age and experience and thats what were driving at and then look at merrill edge new accounts average balance those are deep clients with real money put into work and so are we satisfied we can look at all the awards and the growth and feel spectacularly good about it but you can be satisfied that way but that would be dangerous so we continue to invest and see the numbers of bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 patents we get we see everything we will continue to invest heavily in this platform and what it takes us to is still ahead of us betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and when you think about where you are leveraging the technology in the consumer and wealth versus maybe the high net worth piece of your business versus the institutional piece do you feel like youre running a pace at each of those or is there significantly more to do in one of the sleeves brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp the investment in the commercial cash management side is as we continue to drive global business continues to be high and id say faiz ahmad and the team there continue to challenge themselves to how much more we could do weve invested in merchants now weve got to sell it and mark monica and the team are driving that so i think theres a different again this is a group of businesses that have commonalities and differences and the investment in markets technologies and stuff is critically important but weve built the data capabilities i think all cohorts over the years at billion cost that enables us to build on that platform for risk and finance and markets and then now were continuing to enhance that so id say each one is a different story but all will be better and all were investing heavily and we make choices about the biggest constraint is doability how much stuff can you get done its not the money its really a question you got to make sure you do it right and dont screw it up and that its going to really stick to the ribs when you start driving it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks brian operator well go now to steven chubak with wolfe research your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good afternoon so wanted to start off with just a clarifying question on some of the esg investments i know you provided the guidance on the tax rate of to which includes that benefit from those investments versus is there any incremental drag to other income that we should be thinking about as the pace of those investments steadily builds alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so steven i think were continuing to do more with our clients in terms of the esg side so i think when youre modelling id use say million to million for  to  and then id use just a few hundred million higher for  steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 great and just a question on a followup on capital i was hoping you could just provide some early insights your perspective into how youre handicapping the impact of basel iv adoption in the us and how you think youre positioned relative to peers given lots of significant changes to the regime some positive but also quite a few negative brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp like any other regulatory change when it comes well deal with it but these things have impacts that are like you said plus and minus and life will go on it may cause us to have to adjust a little here and there but wed still have optimization ahead of us in the balance sheet that we can continue to work but when a set of rules get developed and put in front of us and become final well implement them but my guess is it wont be anything that we it wont be as dramatic as going from billion of required capital to billion of tangible common equity over the last decade believe me steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc fair enough and if i could just squeeze in one more followup just a clarifying question on the nii guidance just to help with benchmarking versus peers theyve all guided on nii based on the forward curve i was hoping you could provide just more explicit guidance for full year nii if in fact the forward curve materializes alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so look one of the reasons we dont provide full year is because we dont control what the fed does in terms of number of hikes nor the size of each nor the timing and those things we can control like expenses were quite comfortable with so i think beyond any guidance weve given today steven i would just follow up with lee probably steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay understood thanks so much for taking my questions alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp thank you operator well take our final question today from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi brian how are you bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp good gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc brian can you share with us your thoughts you guys have committed to i think is it trillion in sustainable finance commitments out to and im not asking so much on the climate change and that type of risk i think we all understand that but can you share with us what the financial risk is when you think about your credit card receivable delinquencies obviously if the unemployment rate was to double or triple those delinquencies obviously would go up so we could kind of measure where we think delinquencies could go based on economic activity but what should we be looking at when it comes to sustainable finance just some of the risks that we should be aware of out there again not the climate part im thinking more the financial part brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well at the end of the day these are companies and projects that have to be underwritten and so some of them dont go well so some of the renewable things dont work the way people want them to so its a good and you got bruce thompson and the team in credit and geoff greener and the team in risk i think our track record of underwriting credits strong and so theres a business plan and our investments are to help our clients make the transition we already invest billion to billion and this is a step up from that as we move forward and was a step up so its not some we got to go out and do things we havent been doing we have to just do more of what weve been doing each individual deal is underwritten so whats the risk the risk on the renewable side doesnt work and the risk on the other side is the value of assets comes down because the cash flows start to get impaired by regulation customer change and things like that and so as we go forward that additional consideration of the business plan of a heavily emitting industry will be will its business model sustain and the change in customer behavior and use of things in the near term demand for all energy is going up and the challenge for society is how we meet the needs to have a just transition occur for everyone while changing the emission structure but over time business plans of both the emitter side and the renewable side will come cleaner based on customer behavior people like ourselves reducing our demand for energy it impacts our power companies and how they supply and our demand of our power companies to do more renewables thats going to reverberate through our middle market clients and our millions of small businesses piece by piece by piece so i dont know if thats entirely where youre going gerard but its going to come down to good core underwriting given the circumstances of the individual company its business and its plans and what its transition plans are and the disclosure they make to us in the underwriting process but weve done a great job in commercial underwriting youd have to agree with that over the decades so i think well adjust to each deal and each quarter each deal and each company and each portfolio as we move along bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no no that is helpful thank you and you have done a good job with the underwriting absolutely the followup question brian youve expanded into some new markets i think you mentioned them on the call today maybe columbus ohio if i recall was a relatively new market and minneapolis minnesota are there other markets that you intend to expand into like youve done in those two markets or are you all set youre satisfied with the expansion physically into new areas of the country brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah so a couple things one so why are we expanding in these markets this is a prioritization we first looked at the largest markets that we werent and said why arent we there because were a nationwide brand and capabilities and by the way in a lot of those markets we had wealth management clients so we started in its been a long effort so we did denver starting in and then minneapolis indianapolis pittsburgh south lake columbus cincinnati cleveland and now lexington so theres a list of other markets that we continue to go down largely starting originally the key was to close the top markets which we were in seven if i remember right gerard at the time and were now in all of those so there is really think of the next several years as being going down to the top markets which starts to cover the substantial part of the population where you arent but also even within those markets take grand rapids michigan were not at the level we want to be there and by the way in a place like columbus were now number five in the market we grew at we only have financial centers the end state will be another type of number and so were still building out in these markets and its working and it works because of the way we do it so thatll all be moved but expect us to keep working down by population markets but think about two dimensions one is more markets and the second is also making sure every market what we do is we look at like markets and compare them into same size capabilities and we expect every market will get to the 75th percentile of bank of america business comparative so why is that so that means like even in los angeles were or wealth management share if i remember right versus dc where we have equal representation in consumer dc were market share in wealth management that means we should be in la thats a heck of a lot of work that danny and katie and team have to do so we look at this that way in terms of trying to drive our market share by market and sometimes its people sometimes its branches sometimes its advertising sometimes its charitable work sometimes community work or all of the above but think of us as trying to closeout most of the us population centers over the next several years gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp okay i think thats all our questions operator so let me just close by saying as i said earlier the number one point to remember is the organic growth engine that we had before the pandemic is fully back in gear and driving weve had good expense discipline were now up to two quarters of operating leverage and were working towards driving our streak again the client activity across the board was strong loan growth deposit growth net new households of wealth management gts fees capital markets activity investment banking activity and so those investments across the last several years continue to drive our strong growth and core market share and in the end of the day last year was a record year of earnings and we returned billion of capital to you our shareholders thank you for your support and we look forward to talking to you next time operator that does conclude todays program thank you for your
