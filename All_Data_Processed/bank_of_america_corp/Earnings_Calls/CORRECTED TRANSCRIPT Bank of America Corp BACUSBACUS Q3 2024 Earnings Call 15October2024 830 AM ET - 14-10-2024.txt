earnings materials that are available on the website so with that brian take it away brian t moynihan chairman president chief executive officer bank of america corp thank you lee and good morning and thank all of you for joining us for a discussion of our third quarter results bank of america continued to demonstrate strength this quarter in an economy that continue to be stable albeit with slower growth and falling inflation so many of you have asked from time to time what do we see in our own consumer customer base as we talked about many times our consumer payments is an indicator of activity those payments were up to yearoveryear for the quarter and the total money those consumers moved in the economy the pace of yeartoyear money movement has been steady since late summer this year after having fallen in the spring and early summer this growth in consumer payments continues into the october this activity is consistent with how customers are spending money in the to timeframe when the economy was growing and inflation was under control this report is not meant to gain say that consumers are worry of the cost of living worried about higher rates and other matters but overall activity is fine unemployment is low and wage growth is steady both of which bode well for the consumer overall and for consumer asset quality with respect to what we see in our commercial businesses it is consistent with a lower growth economy line of credit usage rates remain lower than prepandemic levels this does not surprise us what with the dramatic increase in the cost of borrowing for small and medium size businesses they arent being indolent they want to grow they are simply being more careful and worry if final demand will hold therefore they are being cost conscience across the board so how did bank of america do against this backdrop bank of america our commitment to responsible growth remains unwavering and this quarter is another illustration of that we grew we did it the right way in the third quarter bank of america generated billion in revenue and earned billion in net income after tax year todate weve generated net income of just over billion four quarters ago we called it a bottom would occur in our net interest income in the second quarter even with a rate environment that is bounced around quite a bit since we said that we got it right as we expected then indeed troughed in the quarter two nii grew this quarter and as alastair will note later we expect nii to grow again in quarter four even as the market expects two more rate cuts in quarter four this quarter we saw a healthy revenue breath in our wealth and investment management business and in our global markets businesses we returned billion of capital to shareholders while also supporting needs of our clients so with that brief overview lets dive into slide earnings per share came in at this quarter at billion in revenue we grew modestly from the third quarter as improvement in noninterest income more than offset a yearoveryear decline in net interest income fees grew yearoveryear and represented of total revenue bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 the strong yearoveryear fee performance was led by a improvement in investment and broker services mostly in our global wealth management business we also grew investment banking fees yearoveryear sales in trading revenue increased yearoveryear and aggregate these market related revenue streams rose an impressive yearoveryear our total expense in the company increased you can attribute most of the yearoveryear expense growth to these market related areas overall a good job by the team on asset quality a few quarters ago we told you the consumer credit losses will go down this quarter given delinquency trends we had seen at the time we also told you that office losses would be lower both of these proved true again this quarter good asset quality resulted in net chargeoffs and provision expense for this quarter at billion which was unchanged from last quarter our performance is partly attributable to the diversity and balance of the company a little more than half of our earnings come from our consumer and gwim businesses serving people and the other half come from our global banking and markets businesses serving companies and institutional investors so lets turn to see how we grew organically this quarter we are now on slide our organic growth has been driven by continued focus on customers and client experience throughout all our businesses consumer leads the way delivering solid organic growth with highquality accounts and engaged clients for the 23rd consecutive quarter we added significant net new consumer checking accounts and expanded our customer base and market share we added net new checking accounts this quarter which brings our first nine months of to more than net new checking accounts in wealth management we added another net new relationships this quarter in our commercial businesses we added hundreds of small business and commercial banking relationships also note that we saw strong organic growth of investment balances with banking customers and growth in banking products with our investment clients in our gwim business this has led us to now manage trillion in client balances of loans deposits and investments across the consumer and wealth management clients we saw flows of billion into those businesses in the past four quarters in our global banking business we saw loan demands start to pick up late in the quarter we again ranked third in dealogic ib fees indiscernible did have a solid pipeline our global transaction services platform continues to grow around the world and showed strong deposit growth for our commercial businesses over the last year and a quarter this quarter global markets saw continued momentum global markets recorded the 10th consecutive quarter of yearoveryear growth in sales and trading investments weve made in this business and the intensity of the teams has enabled a improvement in sales and trading revenue in the past three years good work by jimmy demare and the team our customers and clients continue to want more from us especially when it comes to our digital capabilities so lets discuss this on slide slide highlights this continued success across our digital platforms as usual we included our disclosures on digital stats across the business which we believe lead the industry i commend you the pages in the appendix which give you more granular disclosure for each of the business digital activities our fully integrated consumer banking investment application drives the utility for our customers across gwim and consumer the usage stats you see are strong proof points our second language capabilities also enhance the customers experience we have grown to more than million active digital users and those digital users logged in more than billion times this quarter we also continue to see more sales through their digital bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 properties digital sales represented of our total consumer sales this quarter note that it simply takes both high touch and hightech to drive continued growth with individual clients across the wealth spectrum in america erica our ai enabled virtual assistant reached billion client interactions since its launch and zelle show continued user and usage increases in our wealth management business we continue to see full relationships increase with both investing in banking relationships being open of the new accounts in merrill were opened digitally whether they were banking accounts or investment accounts this enables more efficient customer coverage for our advisory teams finally of our global banking relationship clients are digitally active we have innovated and significantly streamlined service requests by enabling clients to directly initiate and track inquiries within our award winning cash flow platform as a result app signins for these clients increased nearly in just the last months in summary the economic environment remains solid issues remain out there to external factors that could affect our business and economy generally we still see great opportunities for continued growth across all our businesses were focused on driving market share in all our businesses investing in technology to further enhance the customer experience and continue to increase our efficiency with nii now growing and complementing our fee growth along with our continued solid expense discipline we expect to return to operating leverage as we move through the quarters in with that ill turn to alastair for additional details alastair borthwick chief financial officer bank of america corp thank you brian and im starting on slide of the earnings presentation well touch on more highlights noted here as we work through the material and id just add that we delivered solid returns with a return on average assets of basis points and return on tangible common equity of so lets move to the balance sheet on slide where you can see that the balance sheet ended the quarter at trillion of total assets up billion from the second quarter as global markets client demands expanded and commercial loans grew billion in the quarter otherwise in the quarter the investments of our excess liquidity saw a billion reduction in hold to maturity securities and the combination of shorterterm liquidity investments of cash and available for sale securities were relatively flat to the second quarter on the funding side global markets grew to support balance sheet needs of our clients and total deposits grew billion on an ending basis its noteworthy that our average deposits are now up for the fifth consecutive quarter liquidity remains strong with billion of global liquidity sources and that was up billion compared to the second quarter shareholders equity was up billion with common equity up billion and a preferred redemption driving a billion decline in preferred equity the increase in common equity compared to  included billion in capital return to shareholders partially offsetting our earnings and it included an improvement in aoci driven by an improvement from cash flow hedges given the drop in the longterm rates in the quarter billion in capital distributions includes billion in common dividends and the repurchase of billion in shares tangible book value per share of rose from the third quarter of bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 and turning to regulatory capital our cet1 level improved to billion and the cet1 ratio was and that remains well above our new requirement as of october riskweighted assets increased modestly driven by both lending activity and global markets needs to support clients and our supplemental leverage ratio was compared to the minimum requirement of which leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth our billion of total lossabsorbing capital means our tlac ratio remains comfortably above our requirements so lets dig a little deeper on deposits and the growth from the second quarter using slide here we show you deposits and rates by line of business average deposits grew billion or yearoveryear and they increased modestly linked quarter notably quarteroverquarter increases in rates paid continued to slow again this quarter rising basis points to consumer banking increased modestly driven by product mix and higherrate product offerings and global banking rate paid increased modestly driven by growth in interest bearing balances its worth noting that wealth management declined basis point we acted quickly following the september 50basispoint rate cut in our wealth business and our global banking business and since late in the quarter only a small portion of those cuts are reflected total rate paid for all deposits from these actions is expected to fall below later in october as the fuller effect of the passthroughs occur lets turn to loans by looking at average balances on slide loans in  of trillion improved yearover year driven by solid commercial loan growth as well as credit card and vehicle loans overall commercial loans grew yearoveryear and importantly this included a drop in commercial real estate loans of commercial loans excluding commercial real estate grew yearoveryear and were up annualized from the second quarter consumer banking loan growth was driven by credit card small business and vehicle borrowing and the overall consumer growth was muted by a decline in mortgage balances as paydowns exceeded originations in a higher rate environment lets turn our focus to nii performance and slide so note that our trended investment of excess deposit slide is in our appendix on page deposit levels were billion in excess of loans at the end of  and continue to be a good source of value for shareholders nearly billion or of our excess liquidity is in shortdated cash and afs securities the longerdated loweryielding holdtomaturity book continues to roll off and we reinvest that in higheryielding assets the blended yield of cash and securities on page remains well above our deposit rate paid so going back to slide regarding nii on a gaap nonfte basis nii in  was billion and on a fully tax equivalent basis nii was billion on our third quarter earnings call last year we first provided our expectation that the second quarter would be the trough and then we would begin to grow in the third quarter of marking an inflection point for nii and thats what you see this quarter nii increased by million from the second quarter driven by a number of factors global markets activity and pricing fixed asset repricing and one extra day all benefited nii while higher funding costs partially offset those benefits the 50basispoint rate cut in september also negatively impacted nii bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 with regard to a forward view of nii there are obviously several variables at play in the fourth quarter and we still expect fourth quarter nii to grow and we expect it to be billion or more on a fully tax equivalent basis now we note the following assumptions first we assume that the forward curve on october is the one that materializes so that includes a 25basispoint cut in november and another basis points in december we also assume very modest balance increases in both loans and deposits in  building off the activity seen in  last quarter we told you we expect about billion in the aggregate of fixed rate loans and securities to reprice on a quarterly basis and those are expected to reprice into higheryielding assets and provide a benefit to nii for many periods ahead and as described previously we expect to see roughly million benefit in  from the bsby alternative rate transition so we think this sets us up well for with regard to interest rate sensitivity on a dynamic deposit basis we provide a month change in nii for an instantaneous shift above or below the forward curve on that basis a basis point increase would benefit nii by billion while a decrease of basis points would decrease nii over the next months by billion okay lets now turn to expense and well use slide for the discussion we reported billion in expense this quarter up from the second quarter driven by the revenue improvement in three primary areas that brian noted earlier investment banking investment and brokerage fees and sales and trading revenue all have more activity and incentive variability than other revenues and they were up in aggregate versus the second quarter and up yearoveryear in  our head count of was up a little more than and this quarter we saw the departure of roughly summer interns and we welcomed roughly college graduates from the nearly applications received regarding a forward view in  we dont expect much change in our head count and with continued investments we expect expense to be in line with  of billion as we look into with an expected return of nii growth and through our expense discipline we expect a return to operating leverage and improvement in our efficiency ratio lets turn to credit on slide and the good news is theres not a lot to report here compared to the second quarter net chargeoffs of billion were flat compared to  weve seen consumer losses in a pretty tight range for a few quarters now outside of that we saw lower losses from office exposure and otherwise we had two somewhat unrelated commercial losses the net chargeoff ratio was basis points down basis point from  provision expense was unchanged from  at billion as reserve levels remain constant and with regard to reserve levels on a weighted basis we remain reserved for an unemployment rate of by the end of compared to the most recent rate reported on slide we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios and theres nothing really noteworthy to highlight on this page so lets move to the various lines of business and some brief comments on their results starting on slide with consumer banking consumer banking continues to lead the company in organic growth and this included another strong quarter of net new checking growth another strong period of card openings and investment balances for consumer clients which climbed yearoveryear to a record billion it also included months of strong flows at billion in addition to market appreciation bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 as noted earlier loans grew nicely yearoveryear from credit card and vehicle as well pass small business where we remain the industry leader one highlight to note our practice solutions lending group for doctors and dentists and related professionals saw loans grow yearoveryear all of this organic growth helped to drive billion in net income in  so reported earnings remain strong declining yearoveryear as revenue declined from lower nii partially offset by higher card income with the trajectory shifting in nii we should see earnings in this business begin to shift as well expense rose as we continued our business investments and those investments included those in our people including the announcement of moving our minimum wage to per hour and that raises the minimum annualized salary for our associates to nearly as you can see on the appendix page digital adoption and engagement continued to improve and customer satisfaction scores remain near record levels illustrating the appreciation of enhanced capabilities from our continuous investments bank of americas million zelle users are up in the past months and their volume usage is now up more than customers are now using zelle at nearly three times the rate theyre writing checks and zelle usage is meaningfully surpassed the combination of checks written and atm withdrawals moving to wealth management on slide we produced good results reflecting healthy organic growth and client activity with increased banking activities of our clients and the impacts of increased market levels together with strong assets under management flows with a continued increase in banking product usage from our investing clients the diversity of our revenue base continues to improve more than of our wealth clients now have banking products with us and of our revenue is now in net interest income to complement the fees earned in our advice model net income rose from the third quarter to billion this year in  we reported revenue of nearly billion growing over the prior year led by the growth in asset management fees that brian highlighted earlier expense growth reflects the fee growth and other investments for our future growth as we continue to grow our advisor force through hiring of both experienced advisors and graduates from our training program we welcomed merrill and private bank net new households this quarter and more than a third of those merrill openings were driven by graduates from our training program the business had a margin and generated a strong return on capital of average loans were up year overyear driven by growth in custom lending and a pickup in mortgage lending both merrill and the private bank continued to see healthy organic growth producing strong assets under management flows of billion yearoveryear which reflects a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting money to work we should also highlight the continued digital momentum that youll find on slide as an example three quarters of merrill bank and investment accounts were open digitally this quarter on slide you see global banking results this business produced earnings of billion down yearover year as improved investment banking fees and treasury services revenue were overcome by lower net interest income and higher provision expense revenue declined driven by the impact of interest rates and deposit rotation in our global treasury services business fees for managing the cash of clients continued to offset some of the nii pressure from higher rates investment banking had a strong quarter growing fees yearoveryear to billion led by debt capital markets fees mostly in leverage finance and investment grade we finished the quarter strong maintaining our number three investment banking fee position while began as a slow quarter this summer gained some momentum through september and the pipeline looking forward looks solid an increase in provision expense from last year was driven by the previously noted bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 commercial and cre losses expense increased yearoveryear including continued investments in the business particularly around technology switching to global markets on slide ill focus comments on results excluding dva as we normally do and the team continued their impressive streak of strong revenue and earnings performance they achieved operating leverage and continued to deliver good return on capital earnings of billion grew yearoveryear and return on average allocated capital was revenue again exdva improved from the third quarter of last year as both sales and trading and investment banking fees for institutional clients improved nicely year overyear focusing on sales and trading exdva revenue improved yearoveryear to billion ficc increased while equities increased compared to the third quarter of ficc revenues remained strong growing over both the prior year and the second quarter driven by momentum in currencies trading equities had a record third quarter driven by strong trading performance in derivatives and cash yearoveryear expenses were up on revenue improvement and our continued investment in the business finally on slide all other shows a loss of million revenue was lower and included a charge to other income of roughly million related to visas increase in its litigation escrow account the decline in expense was driven by reduced costs of a liquidating business and lower legal expense our effective tax rate for the quarter was and excluding discrete items and the tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing the effective tax rate would have been approximately so thats where ill stop and with that well open it up for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from jim mitchell of seaport global jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning i guess ill ask the nii question alastair you talked about still feel comfortable troughing in the second quarter poised to grow so can you maybe give us a little bit more on based on the forward curve any kind of rough thinking on how nii trajectory from here beyond and what kind of growth you may be thinking about in just any kind of bigger than a bread box conversation would be helpful alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp jim good morning i think if we went back to three quarters ago we sort of saw this trough appearing in the second quarter and we felt like as the deposits were beginning to find the floor wed be in a position where we could begin to see nii grow so obviously that happened in  and at this point we feel like were in a good position to do that again in  well provide guidance i think for when we get back together again a quarter from now part of the reason we try not to do months in advance is because an awful lot moves with the rate curve remember this year at one point we had six cuts another point we had one cut and even this past quarter i think the market was surprised with an extra cut bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 what were focused on then is just driving the underlying organic growth so deposit growth were getting to a point now weve had five quarters in a row global banking is back to normal seasonality wealth is flattening out and consumer is slowing and is in a place now where we think were pretty close to finding that floor so deposits in a good place the rotation is slowing weve got a little pickup in loan growth this past quarter thats good weve got the fixed rate asset repricing over time from which well benefit and weve got some cash flow swaps resetting as well so look were in a position where we believe were going to grow nii again in the fourth quarter thats going to set us up i think quite well in terms of and importantly weve acted fast with that first couple of rate cuts so we feel like weve put ourselves in a good position to grow from here jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thats helpful and maybe just a follow up on the deposit question you guys had really strong growth in net new checking accounts but consumer deposits still shrinking a little bit do you see any change in behavior since the rate cuts or how are you thinking about consumer deposit growth and wealth too i guess were seeing commercial growth but sort of those other pieces on the retail side that have yet to sort of inflect how are you thinking about that brian t moynihan a chairman president chief executive officer bank of america corp if you look across the last several weeks the wealth management has basically been flat at that 280oddbillion level jim and the consumer business bounces around move billion on a pay day to give you a sense but basically the major moves are over and now were bouncing around billion to billion on a given day importantly the noninterestbearing piece going back to your generation new checking accounts seems to be stable much of the movement in the consumer business writ large has been for more interest ratesensitive clients with higher balances having moved and youre seeing that also slow so we feel good about the stability of consumer at this point and we can the deposits new accounts were putting on today are the future of the franchise and thats where we keep building towards so were investing to generate those accounts that are primary accounts in the household and start with an average balance of say and move up to over time so feel good about it jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thanks operator well take our next question brian t moynihan a chairman president chief executive officer bank of america corp one thing just to add jim just as you think about it remember that were sitting in the consumer we indiscernible basically billion in balances to the billion level now which is a significant difference in the earnings power of that business bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 operator well take our next question from gerard cassidy of rbc hey mr cassidy your line is open please proceed with your question well move next to betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning brian t moynihan a chairman president chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc just to follow up on this last thread of questions two things one the deposits how much do you feel that the rate environment has impacted you in terms of the deposit growth that youve generated here and the degree of shrinkage rate that youve seen in some of the businesses is it rate driven do you think brian t moynihan a chairman president chief executive officer bank of america corp i guess betsy in the end of the day remember that weve grown deposits for four straight quarters what is rate driven is at the margin consumer customers that have have moved have less in their deposit accounts honestly than prepandemic when the aggregate holds up so think about that the constant customers that have been with us since then and so the movement now is just bumping around based on seasonal flows of people paying taxes and people having spent money in the summer and paying down the bills from that and things like that so we feel theres stability on the consumer side stability on the wealth management side including a movement of the higherend balances in the market and a lot of that pricing on both of those business adjust automatically given the rate cut and then on commercial balances thats just evidence of the buildup of cash and corporate balance sheets and the activity levels of those customers so we feel good across the board and basically for several quarters in a row we continue to grow the balances the rate impacts really the higherend balances because remember noninterest bearing and the consumers and lowinterest cost checking is driving a lot of the value and is a stable balance betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right and i know last quarter we were talking a lot about the sweeps and that whole pricing dynamic anything this quarter to say about that reflecting on how you indicated in the slide youre at billion you came down basis point i mean its like de minimis right so just the underlying question is are we past this whole sweep thing brian t moynihan a chairman president chief executive officer bank of america corp we fully effected that through our customer base if thats a question youll ask bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right brian t moynihan a chairman president chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then the other question i had just was on the global banking alastair you mentioned that corporate loan demand picked up late in the quarter maybe you could give us some color on whats driving that is that mainly a function of ma picking up and the legs that you see to that demand would be really helpful to understand thanks so much alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so look weve obviously seen pretty modest loan growth over the course of the past year and its modest loan growth that weve put in our forward nii guidance but we were pleased to see a little bit more loan growth at the end of the quarter there thats why you see the balances up a little more end of period than perhaps the prior quarter and the last two quarters have been better than the previous quarter so i dont know if thats early to call it a streak but were obviously pleased to see it its been pretty consistent across our small business our business banking our commercial banking clients and id say were not really seeing revolver utilization picking up yet probably too early for that rates havent come down that much or hadnt come down till really late in the quarter so that potentially is a place for some upside in loan growth over time but we havent put that in our guidance at this stage betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay perfect thanks so much operator well take our next question from glenn schorr of evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thank you one quickie followup on the nii front im just curious current duration of the securities portfolio and maybe a fixed and floating mix split and how youre thinking about that short duration as the forward curve starts to play out thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yes so not a great deal of change glenn for us in terms of the securities portfolio from what we said before obviously the hold to maturity continues to run off i think its now quarters in a row another billion or so this quarter which allows us to reinvest at higher yields so that remains basically our first thought with respect to bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 the investment strategy is just allow that to continue rolling down and were going to continue to prioritize supporting loan growth for our clients and you can sort of see that htm runoff over time funding the loans growth that weve had over time then whatevers left over from deposits growing were normally putting into cash and cash equivalents or were paying down expensive shortterm liabilities so if you look youd see that weve allowed about billion or so of institutional cds to roll off this quarter and at the margin were taking a little bit of one to threeyear fixed rate maybe billion or billion in the last couple of quarters but remember were trying to balance capital liquidity earnings and its less about a rate view and its more about just how the portfolio composition is changing over time glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc yeah good color i appreciate it wanted to maybe get a little bit more color in the opening remarks you mentioned the 10th straight quarter of quarteronquarter improvements in markets revenue ph which is clear to see can you remind us exactly where youve been investing the lions share of both people and balance sheet and is that an ongoing process that we can obviously we cant get it every single quarter but meaning is this a ongoing capital effort to continue to boost results across markets thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yes well look weve pointed out before and i think youll see it again in our results this quarter if you look at the organic growth highlights on page youll see pretty good growth in each of our four big segments markets is no different in that regard relative to the other three in that we continue to invest in that business i wouldnt pick out any particular area in fixed income or equities for people investments i think as jimmy demare has highlighted its about for us filling gaps with existing clients and making sure were there for them over time so weve added people across the various businesses and then with respect to balance sheet its a little bit of rwas as brian highlighted its a little bit of liquidity allowing us to support the financing businesses and id say were benefiting from the fact that weve got a leading sales and trading franchise in each of the major elements of fixed income and equities that allows us to capture the benefits of having a diversified business with an organic growth strategy brian t moynihan a chairman president chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah i think glenn its if youve been following our company for a long time and its been five six seven years where we started saying our position was set in the business so we could start to grow keeping it balanced to the overall company so billion to billion of balance sheet in the market every day and the security with jim and the team they do a great job turning it over managing the risk indiscernible well managed you can see the no trading losses for many many quarters in a row or one maybe and so the way they are running but its a longterm investment and this business requires investment around data controls measurement financial reports nonfinancial reports trade reports billions of trades a day reported so its a business where we think we have a very good position because of the talent and the team does a good job but its not something that we decided to do yesterday this has been a longterm build that weve been building and growing and keeping a balance of the rest of the company so and it continues to do a good job glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 great thanks for all that operator well take our next question from matt oconnor of deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning was wondering if you could talk about the outlook for share buybacks you did billion this quarter obviously generating a lot of capital has excess capital and sounds like the outlook for loan growth is for some but not a ton so alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp good morning matt no change to the capital strategy obviously whats become very clear over the course of the past year is weve got the capital so we build the capital over time to make sure that we were in a good position for basel iii final as originally proposed if it were put together today and we have the time to build more over time because after dividend youre talking about basis points of capital generation every quarter so were waiting at this point to see the final rules as they come out thats going to allow us to give you a much more precise answer over time and the waterfall priority remains exactly the same its number one weve got to support the clients you saw that last quarter with the loan growth thats always going to be our priority support the clients invest in the future of the business number two we want to maintain and grow the dividend over time weve added another to the dividend this quarter and we want to make sure that were in a great place to hurdle the regulatory minimum so we feel good there and then number three well use whats left to return it to you the shareholder this quarter thats another billion thats on top of the billion last quarter so were in a good position i think to support the future growth of the company and to continue to buy back shares over time matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just a different topic you guys have talked about this concept of normalized net interest margin of about ph looking out a couple of a few years any updates on the timing of that and then i think a lot of that is being driven by the fixed rate asset repricing but how does lower rates impact it can you reach that level with the current forward curve for example thank you alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah well look the most important thing is we got to get back to growing nii and weve been saying that now for three quarters believing the  would be the trough so we demonstrated the growth this quarter were in a good position to do it again next quarter and were on the path were poised to improve with nii from here its a grind every quarter weve got to continue to grow the deposits weve got to grow the loans weve got to make sure that we think about pricing across the board you are right to highlight weve got some attractive fixed rate asset repricing over time weve got some reinvestment over time and then obviously we have to watch what goes on with the rate curve when theres a surprise like an extra basis points thatll flow through the entire fourth quarter it might set us back a few weeks but we just keep doing what were doing the organic growth is going to fuel the net interest income growth over time and then niy will be an output and nii will remain our focus bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator thank you well take our next question from mike mayo of wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i guess im asking the same question each quarter but its because the efficiency ratio seems to be getting worse so reconciling slide with slide once again slide is your digital adoption slide which shows to adoption in all of your lines of business and the trends were all getting better so much more of a digital company and then we look at slide and your efficiency ratio is versus last quarter versus a year ago with noncomp expense up this quarter so when we get back to those days when we count the number of quarters of consecutive positive operating leverage and kind of whats the disconnect here alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp okay so look thats what were focused on is getting back to that operating leverage mike the pressure right now is coming largely from incentive comp related to the fee businesses so think about sales and trading up investment banking up asset management up if you look at wealth management loan were talking about million there just in that segment alone so thats good investment and its good return and i think if you strip that out you see were doing pretty well in an inflationary environment we expect good fees from here we expect the good expense that comes with that and then its about managing the rest its about operational excellence its about the digital and as the nii shines through together with the fees and as the credit costs continue to normalize we think were in a good position to deliver operating leverage again so were looking forward to getting back to that period and its just about grinding out nii growth at this point mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and when you think the nii is shining through will help that inflection is this a fourth quarter event is it next year and can you give us a sneak preview for next year on what youre thinking just because its been a little bit of a slog admittedly with the headwind from nii alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah well look i think again this is one of those things where weve got to see the deposits turn around in all of the businesses and weve got to make sure that weve got the nii trajectory but we kind of feel like thats going to be a operating leverage question and well be able to update you i think with some precision as we get into the fourth quarter some of thats going to depend on the rate curve and well play it by ear as we go through mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 operator well take our next question from vivek juneja of jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks alastair just wanted to go through the waterfall slide you had in the second quarter deck on nii obviously youve got the day count and youve talked about the bsby hedge benefit coming on can you talk through the other pieces that you had on that slide since the slide was not continued this quarter alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah i think if you were to look we havent updated it here because were trying to get a six month forward view back at the time and it was just helpful to do it that way now were just given the three months we just figured we would give you the overall guidance youre going to see the same component parts vivek as we laid out there so largely speaking id say  laid out the way that we thought it would and  is setting up pretty much the same way also were going to get some benefit from the bsby transition feeding back into the pl were going to get some benefit from the fixed rate assets repricing over time some of that comes from things like mortgage residential mortgage on our books some of it comes from cvl some will come from htm securities rolling off and reinvestment and well get some benefit from cash flow swaps so that remains something thats sort of underlying all of the quarters going forward and then the remaining piece is the part that we work so hard on its the growing deposits growing loans its the organic growth showing forward and coming through in the numbers versus what happens with the rate curve so i think as we get together in  well probably give you a pretty good sense for what that looks like as it goes through vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and alastair what about the other two pieces so youd have million negative impact from rate cuts obviously more there and then you have the global markets nii any color on those two components alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well id say on the rate cuts if you were to go back to when we provided  guidance at the time we said one cut in september one in october one in november and as it turns out we all know that there were two cuts in september that extra cut flows all the way through the fourth quarter its not just two weeks in the quarter or six weeks its the full quarter so thats a additional headwind if you like so that obviously hurts overall global markets is liability sensitive and theyve continued to grow their loans so i think if the rate cuts hurt us a little bit more in that original waterfall you get a little bit of that back in global markets nii so that probably answers those two elements vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 operator well take our next question from sharon leung of wolfe research sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc hi im calling in for steven chubak just on the securities side i know last quarter you had laid out the repricing tailwind of about basis points on securities a little bit less on the loan side can you just give us an update on where those figures sit today alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah id say id just use probably basis points on the securities probably basis points on the mortgages probably basis points on the cvl that probably gets you in the right ballpark sharon sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc perfect and then just another quick follow up on the securities portfolio i know you guys are seeing some repricing tailwinds there but have you ever given any thought on like doing a bigger repositioning action just because the market seems to be responding favorably to some similar actions as some of your peers alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well at this stage we dont see any need for that remember most of our securities and the available for sale weve got those held at this point in treasury swaptofloating and we feel like if you look at the nii sensitivity of the company over time its come down with the composition of our portfolio so we feel like were in a good position at this point to grow nii grow earnings and we obviously start with a very good base of liquidity and capital so no plans to reposition at this point sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc okay perfect thank you so much operator thank you well take our next question from erika najarian of ubs erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning appreciate that you want to wait until january alastair to give us an nii update given how much is changing or how much has been changing in the curve so maybe im going to ask this this way youve talked about hedges in the past in terms of the sensitivity of your floating rate loan specifically in commercial as we think about forecasting for whatever rate curve turns out and we think about your floating rate loans ex card should we assume a similar sensitivity or on the way down on the way up excluding bsby or will the hedges essentially give you some floor in that your sensitivity to repricing going forward again exbsby is not as significant as it was on the way up alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 yeah so i think its okay to start with the same sensitivity on the way down as up because the companys largely speaking positioned in the same way at the same time you put your finger on it we are going to benefit from repricings over time and we mentioned last quarter and weve talked about already on this call the fact that weve got the various securities and the various new originations that replace those loans that are maturing so that remains the case and then weve got some cash flow swaps a number of them are pointed against the commercial and as we particularly as we get into the third quarter and fourth quarter of youll see a benefit in commercial yields there because those ones are at lower rates and they will be repriced in  and  so a little bit of cushion there thats one of the reasons that as we look forward into nii we can sort of see how this repricing thats taking place remember were coming off of a period now with a a long period years of a very very low set of yields and were coming back now to something where you can really see the full value of our deposit base and it takes a while its quarterbyquarter we just got to let it develop over time erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and my followup question is clearly you have one of the best views on deposit behavior in the us and its been so long since weve seen a neutral rate thats not zero so i guess a twopart question the first is should we similarly assume the same ability to recapture on deposit repricing on the way down as it was on the way up in terms of the same deposit beta and as we think about it may have better loan growth where do you think if our neutral rate is where does bank of americas natural deposit cost fall relative to that brian t moynihan a chairman president chief executive officer bank of america corp erika i think much discussion over the last couple of years about betas and everything but if you look where we sort of stand at the end of the third quarter the difference between fed funds and the total interestbearing cost of our deposits is around basis points almost basis points if you looked at quarter two in when the fed funds hit the highest rate in the last cycle that difference was basis points basis points so theres a what youre pointing out leave aside betas and everything else theres a fundamental difference of basis points in spread against the interestbearing side and we take the noninterestbearing piece that obviously has a bigger impact so this will settle in but you are right for the and youve been around this industry for a long time but if you go back and think about when the fed funds rate was sustained in the level this industry was able to make more money due to the extra value relative to the last years of the noninterestbearing deposits in the consumer businesses and the small business and commercial business and wealth management business so we feel good about the positioning we feel good about our deposit makeup which is driven by core operating activity the primary household in consumer side the operating accounts in the businesses and small businesses and even the wealth management so you should see more you will see more value im confident and thats what were looking forward to as the rate structure settles in and so the key to your point is not the path of of whether the cuts come in one quarter or another quarter the key that i think is different is the blue chip economists your economists im sure and our economists all predict that well end up the terminal rate at a level as opposed to the past cycles where we didnt ever get there and rates were starting to be cut at the end of erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 that was super helpful guys thank you operator and well take a followup question from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi alastair hi brian apologize for missing the earlier queue brian t moynihan a chairman president chief executive officer bank of america corp we lost you gerard we were worried gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc fell into the ocean alastair you touched on the basel in one of your comments regarding how youre in good position from your capital standpoint from the original proposal can you give us any color on what you guys have seen from that presentation that vice chair barr gave earlier in the quarter what your views are where you might come in i think they said there was an average increase of capital for the group of about and how you might stack up against that brian t moynihan a chairman president chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah im not sure we have enough detail gerard to give you a specific at this point when the reproposal comes out what were told is it will not only be about itll repropose the whole entire picture including the changes outlined in vice chair barrs speech but you could take it for granted that that was more favorable than the original proposal so therefore well benefit from it and once we see something thats a little more detailed we might be able to give you a better estimate but its favorable to us gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i see and brian do you think that could step up your activity of returning more capital if it comes in betterthan expected you would take that as an opportunity maybe to return more capital to shareholders brian t moynihan a chairman president chief executive officer bank of america corp in the end of the day we have excess capital based on the estimates of the old one so yes it would at the margin but remember at the end of the day gerard we are sending capital back to shareholders because of the fact that the franchise generates activity without using a ton of capital and grows its loans deposits earnings et cetera so we will continue to be disciplined with the capital and the capital return and well continue to return more of it if more is available were sitting with a fair amount of excess over the current set of rules and if a new set of rules are more favorable than the original proposal that would set us up better no question gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then just as a follow up you guys have been building out your obviously branch banking system throughout the country and markets in which you dont have a big presence can you just give us an update on bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 how that is progressing and what are you seeing that makes you because youve got great consumer numbers youve got great read on your customers what really makes you guys excited that this is really the way to go a combination of the digital and these branches brian t moynihan a chairman president chief executive officer bank of america corp well i think if we look at markets we just celebrated years in denver from the first opening which the first among the first five markets we went after and so if you look at this market as i was look at the fdic data and you kind of look at the last couple years its kind of chopped up because of the stimulus and everything but you see continued progress by us in all these markets moving from nowhere into the 10th and 7th and 8th and we keep building that out what with that does is we believe in hightouch hightech across all individuals and even small businesses and even a little bit in the middle market and what do we mean by that is for even wealthy customers there are times when they need to utilize a branch and if you have no branch in denver or columbus or indianapolis or minneapolis or et cetera its a little hard for them to get the full experience so weve done that now as we think about it we had extreme discipline were going after this to build out markets to a level we feel comfortable that we have the market covered and so instead of putting one in every place were trying to build out a network in a place like columbus where i think we have branches now and that allows us to build the business we already have a major merrill presence there we already had commercial banking presence there this allows us to build underneath it and so thats why youre seeing our deposits in those branches push past million per branch which is much different than we see in others doing it because the density and the capacity and the digital and the prior customer base for lack of better term that we now can get more from so the team is doing a good job we expect you have to go down those paths but in the end of the day we are trying to get coverage in the top markets across the country so that we cover the american population in an efficient and effective way and the truth of the matter is even though were sales across all of the businesses in consumer all different types of products a lot of the checking sales only digital are about in the as opposed to the which means people still like to walk in a branch and start a relationship and thats why were there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good appreciate the color as always thank you operator and this does conclude todays qa id like to return the call to brian moynihan for closing comments brian t moynihan chairman president chief executive officer bank of america corp i thank all of you for joining us we operated well in the quarter delivering billion of earnings after tax a share as we told you we
