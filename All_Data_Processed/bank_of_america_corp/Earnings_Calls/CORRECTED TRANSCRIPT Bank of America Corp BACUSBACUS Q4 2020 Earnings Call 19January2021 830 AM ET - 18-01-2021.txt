to brian take it away brian brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thank you lee and good morning to all of you and thank you for joining us today before i pass the call to paul to review the fourth quarter i wanted to hit a few points first i want to provide some brief commentary on for the full year then talk about what we see in the economy as we enter and then highlight some areas where i believe we made strong strategic progress that will drive momentum into and beyond so starting on slide was a tough operating environment as you all know in that period we generated net income of nearly billion or of eps and earned a return above our cost of capital our eps was down compared to driven by the impacts of coronavirus pandemic on the company and the economy as you know the fed dropped rates to nearly zero long rates also fell to historic lows loan demand surged and then waned as the panic subsided that reduced net interest income but as we told you last quarter we believe nii had likely bottomed in the third quarter of in fact we saw a modest improvement this quarter which paul will cover later despite the challenges from lower loans noninterest revenue declined slightly but included some interesting dynamics highlighting diversity of bank of americas model consumer fees declined driven by the activity levels of clients but also by higher account balances in customer accounts thats a good thing for the economy going forward bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 our business mix allowed us to benefit from more marketrelated activities in sales and trading investment banking and investment brokerage in the wealth management businesses our full year revenue of billion from sales and trading rose and we generated more than billion of investment banking revenues this year an increase of over last year investment and brokerage revenue grew to nearly billion our expenses were higher as a result of the many costs associated with covid and the support for our teams our clients and our communities we serve for a comparison of and included the third quarter addition of merchant services costs following dissolution of the joint venture in the third quarter of these costs were always incurred as a net revenue deduction under joint venture accounting but now come through our expense line setting aside the elevated covidrelated expense and the change in accounting for merchant services our teams continue to do a good job managing costs and youll see that later when paul will talk about it and maintained a focus on user and productivity gains to fund all the investments were making across the franchise and including increasing client flows expenses then remained relatively flat yearoveryear and we expect them to be flat for versus provision was higher as a result of reserves built given the macroeconomic deterioration experienced in the first part of the year this also reflects the new cecl accounting rules which were adopted as of january but as the macroeconomic outlook improved we released some reserves in the fourth quarter as we look at share count it declined driven by the amount of shares bought as we moving into second half of and then in the first quarter of prior to us suspending share repurchases with billion of excess capital above our common cet1 minimum requirements and excess capital above slr reverting back to its normal calculation and completion of the ccar exam well once again begin repurchasing shares starting today as you know our first priority for use of all our capital is to grow our business organically and we have funded growth in many areas and we have funded expanded minimum wages to an hour for all our teammates we funded increased covid benefits and weve taken care of all that now were looking to return as much capital to our shareholders as were allowed and as our board deems prudent so you saw this morning the beginning of that in a separate press release that our board has approved share repurchase in the first quarter of up to billion including shares issued to employees this is in addition to maintaining our quarterly dividend of per quarter and that accounts for return of another billion of capital this is the maximum allowed under the feds guidelines established for the first quarter beyond the first quarter when we find out what the rules are well continue to change our authorizations to reflect those rules in summary it was a good year given the circumstances of the health crisis and the impact on the economy and the markets around the world i want to thank my teammates for the hard work they did to serve our clients to serve our communities and to help each other as we begin the new year lets turn to the economy and what we see is a continued recovery occurring consumer spending by our clients and asset quality continued to improved our companies are highly liquid and generally in pretty good shape except of course for those industries that are most hardhit by covid as the economy continues to push ahead these companies that are operating will need operating capital and we saw early signs of loan demand stabilizing as we went through the fourth quarter as we all know theres one priority and thats to get everyone vaccinated so the healthcare crisis is behind us and therefore the economy can regain its strength bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 our research team just this past week has upgraded the forecast their view is that us gdp growth will be around and global forecast for growth are let me give you a snapshot of what we see in our customer data that supports some of our views for growth on slide you can see the consumer payments with million consumer and small business clients making payments across all our channels we have a rich dataset that provides a deep view of the us consumer payment trends and small business trends you can see this on slide this chart shows solid lines reflecting cumulative change to the year in spending the dotted line shows the year overyear change for each month during the year in total spending consumer payment activity began and ended the year very strong in the first two months of the year payments were up high single digits yearoveryear by april given the early spread of the pandemic and the full across the board economic lockdowns which is different in the status we are now payments dropped and were down by early summer payments snapped back and you can see that here with the reopening of economies in many areas the impact of government stimulus and increased unemployment as some of those funds were depleted and ran off and the volumes in fact grew back to normal levels we saw a slowdown in the rate of the recovery but still spending managed to grow at a level consistent with prepandemic prior year periods and as we entered the holiday period which was lengthened this year by the difference in activity of retail purchasing the trends continued to strengthen total payments in the month of december hit a high of billion up yearoveryear driven by a record volume of holiday spending full year payments reached a new high of trillion up yearoveryear so one of the things we have done here is provide a pie chart in the lower lefthand side of this page for an important reason when we think about consumer spending we think about all the ways consumers take money and consume and spend it to do things this is outside of just debit and credit spending habits which tend to get all the discussion because theyre easier to track quite frankly but they represent of transaction volume but only about of the dollar volume of transactions and you can see that they make up that smaller amount on the lower lefthand side and especially as travel and entertainment spending has shifted away actually weve been seeing debit spending outgrow credit spending so of dollar volume payments made by our consumers happen through persontoperson payments persontobusiness payments ach wires and many other means including cash taken out of atms and spent and checks written so in terms of transactions you can see at the bottom right of this chart how the physical payment of cash and checks have moved to more digital forms which create operational efficiencies for us and has been a strategic initiative for many years and one that was moved forward by the crisis full year cash and check transaction the volume fell to lowest on record down as covid accelerated the migration to digital cardbased payments has begun as a strong year for payments the new stimulus checks started hitting customers accounts in the first weeks of january more than million of those payments have hit our accounts about billion and they flowed into the accounts mostly from digital transfers through irs so how payments performed in the first half of january the first half of january across all these payment types is up from in good news debit and credit is up growth rates in total exceed precovid levels of growth rates and theyre larger dollar amounts so bigger dollars and faster growth rates and that is with about of the payments being spent by our primary checking customers so more to be spent bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 as we move to slide we can see the activity on the commercial side in the closing weeks of we continue to see some stabilization mainly driven by our middle market auto finance clients as inventories have gotten low and they rebuild them the chart on the top of slide sic slide reflects the total global banking loans across all segments business banking global commercial banking and global corporate and investment banking as you recall in the first quarter of the year we experienced a heightened level of client draws on commitments as the panic borrowing set in with the crisis and that was about three years of normalized commercial loan growth in a single month and as you know driven by capital markets for the gcib clients and soft loan demand as people gathered their wits about them and the crisis moved to a different stage we saw significant paydowns on loan balances during the last two months of the year we have seen more stable results that we hope can continue to turn into increased demand and growth as we look forward on the chart on the bottom of the page you can see that middle market and business banking that core part of the american economy has started to tip up but larger corporate loans continue to be affected by the markets and declines of the period a decade of operating under responsible growth principles prepared us well for this crisis and allowed us to remain focused on our customer under a wellunderstood risk framework and support them and the communities they live in and in fact we have basically reopened all the credit underwriting to the standards that we had before the crisis we are wellpositioned against this improving economic backdrop because of progress we made in respect of our strategic initiatives over the many years lets go to the next slide slide and well talk about the strategic progress we can start with the consumer bank in the upper left as you know we retain the number one deposit share position for retail deposits thats billionplus and coupled with our wealth management deposits for american consumers we have trillion in deposits now we grew average consumer deposits billion or billion of that billion was lowcost checking accounts customer satisfaction ended the year at a new alltime high and of the top markets across america representing over half of us population we now hold the number one two or three leadership position including in of those markets the number one position which is twice as many markets as our closest peer another important consumer objective has been the focus on digital banking digital engagement expanded throughout all our businesses through the year of our consumer wealth management households are now digitally active not just enrolled but active thats up a couple hundred basis points and theres deep penetration of customer base these clients signed in billion times this year representing doubledigit growth and they arent just signing in for transactions or looking at their balances they are also buying things of the sales this year were digital sales it expanded in areas of checking account sales auto sales and mortgage loan sales erica our digital assistant users grew to million they spent million hours those clients did talking to erica interacting with it in zelle the p2p payment form p2b payment form also is up yearoveryear remember those earlier payments charts on the earlier pages theres a lot of growth ahead here and it helps us move from higher cost to lower cost means whats interesting about the zelle customers is the depth of the relationship they have with us on average they have three accounts with bank of america an average checking balance of more than and an average investment balances of when they have investment balances now switching more broadly consumer investment balances these are investment balances of mass affluent in our consumer business surpassed a major milestone and moved over billion with million accounts we added new funded accounts in in that mass affluent segment thats up yearoveryear in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 september we rolled out life plan our financial planning that helps people prioritize their financial goals and weve had millionplus plans created already one of the fastest rollouts of a product weve ever had as we move to the wealth management group we saw record client balances of trillion through both market appreciation and flows product integration continued to improve as merrill clients utilized our checking services and their checking balances at bank of america were up yearoveryear and digital adoption by merrill clients increased as of the checks deposited by merrill clients were done digitally and the private bank clients continued the strong adoption with of the checks they deposited were deposited digitally despite the virtual environment the inability to have facetoface meetings and inherently the wealth management business is a facetoface business household growth accelerated through the second half of the year with merrill adding netnew households and the private bank adding and indeed we had a record year for millionplus new relationships across the two businesses when we turn to our commercial businesses in global banking we focused on virtual services for clients through the covid crisis increased our calling efforts this year in terms of number of engagements with clients we saw a significant gain in our investment banking market share overall in all areas but particularly in our middle market clients weve achieved a strong position this year this has been a multiyear effort of hiring more and dedicating more bankers investment bankers to be part with the commercial banking relationship managers across the country given the nature of clients and staff working from home the digital capabilities we had allowed our client development to continue we saw record signons through our cashpro app this is the way a commercial customer accesses that app in the commercial cash management businesses in december alone of business days there were over billion moved on that app this shows our clients growing comfort level with the system we reported record investment banking fees with three of our strongest quarters in the companys history this year we improved our overall fee ranking to number three as market share grew basis points is up for two consecutive years in a row these market share improvements include our highestever shares in equity capital markets and ma advice in fixed income trading and markets business the trading side of the house we continue to enhance our etrading capabilities increase our system speed and ability to process customer trades even faster in the equities trading side of the house we had our best year since when the merger of merrill and bank of america took place and we gained market share even while the market was growing in cash equities we estimate we picked up basis points in cash equities in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter last year the last point i want to mention is all the work we continue to do with our clients around our activities in environmental social and governance including our awardwinning proprietary research from the number one research platform in the world as well as sustainable financing initiatives including green bonds sustainable bonds and covidrelated bonds our team also committed billion to further economic opportunities and address racial injustice in the middle of the covid pandemic weve made significant progress and made announcements over the last six months on the strong work done there and with that let me turn it over to paul for the quarter bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 paul m donofrio chief financial officer bank of america corp thanks brian hello everyone im starting on slide and together as i did last quarter i will mostly compare our results relative to  as most investors we speak with are more interested in our progress as we traverse the pandemic rather than comparison to prepandemic periods in  we earned billion or per share which compares to billion or a share in  compared to  the earnings improvement was driven by lower provision expense as we released million in reserves nearly offsetting net chargeoffs which also declined also benefiting earnings expenses declined million from  on lower litigation costs and nii moved from the  trough noninterest income declined from  but results across individual line items were mixed first the decline in other income was driven by seasonal client activity with respect to esg investments which created higher partnership losses but benefited our annual tax rate as i have described in previous discussions our tax rate for the year was if we adjust for the tax benefit of our portfolio of esg investments our tax rate would have been roughly i point this out to emphasize that the full year tax benefits of these socially responsible investments more than offset the portion of losses recorded in other income throughout the year relative to  noninterest income was also impacted by lower sales and trading which typically slows from  to  but while sales and trading revenue was down linkedquarter yearoveryear it was up on the positive side noninterest income benefited from higher asset management fees as the market improved and we grew netnew households again this year and finally we had another good quarter of investment banking revenue which increased from both the strong  levels and yearoveryear also when comparing net income to  remember the  tax expense benefited by million from the revaluation of our uk deferred tax asset finally with respect to returns note that our rotce was and our roa approached basis points moving to slide the balance sheet expanded billion versus  to trillion in assets total assets the main point is that deposits are driving and funding substantially all of this growth deposits grew billion in the quarter and are up billion from  on the other hand loans declined from  with deposits up loans down excess liquidity is piling up in our cash and securities portfolios global liquidity sources are up billion yearoveryear and billion just from  in fact global liquidity is up so much that it now exceeds total loans with respect to regulatory ratios the standardized approach remains binding at consistent with  shareholders equity increased billion as earnings were more than three times the amount of common dividends paid plus we issued preferred stock totaling billion but this was offset by higher rwa as we invested more cash in securities at our cet1 ratio is basis points above our minimum requirement which equates to a billion capital cushion our tlac ratio also increased and remains comfortably above our requirements before leaving the balance sheet as usual we provide the charts on slide and to show the historical trends with respect to average loans and deposits for reference we included these same charts on an endofperiod basis in the appendix overall yearoveryear total loans are down and in the lines of business they are down the decline yearoveryear was driven by lower revolver utilization and other pay downs in commercial and by pullback in credit card activity on slide we provide the same trends by line of business for deposits brian already made a number of points on deposits and you can see the tremendous yearoveryear growth in every line of business that led to growth in deposits for the company at trillion in deposits far surpasses any previous record for deposits bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 we believe our strong deposit growth reflects our customers overall experience with us as we continue to innovate around digital capabilities as well as enhance our nationwide physical footprint of financial centers and atms which have continued to prove important to customers and clients i will just add that given historically low interest rates our rate paid on deposits declined modestly linked quarter and we are now lower than the rate paid to customers in before the fed began raising rates and i will point out that our interest cost on trillion of deposits this quarter was only million turning to slide and net interest income on a gaap nonfte basis nii in  was billion billion on an fte basis while net interest income declined audio gap from  the improvement from  was driven by the increased deployment of excess deposits into securities lower loan balances lower reinvestment rates and modestly higher mortgagebacked securities premium write offs mitigated the improvement in nii the net interest yield was relatively stable declining only basis point from the  level note that given all the deposit growth plus the low starting point with respect to interest rates our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains quite large and is a good reminder of the value of these deposit relationships now with respect to nii as we move into we offer the following perspectives our perspectives on nii is assume that net interest rates follow the forward curve and do not move lower than current levels and that the economy does not taking meaningfully step backwards as a result of recent negative covid developments with that said first i would remind everyone that  will be impacted by two less days of interest which is a headwind of nearly million also seasonally we would expect to see payments related to holiday spending result in lower card balances we also have the continuing impact of higher yielding assets maturing or paying off and being replaced with lower yielding ones offsetting these headwinds we currently intend to again invest a portion of our excess deposits which continued to grow in  into securities having listed those specific  impacts nii improvement more generally will depend on all the factors we are all focused on such as loan growth ppp loan forgiveness and ppp new originations and mortgage refinancings as well as mortgagebacked security payment speeds which impact the writeoff of bond premiums should those trends develop in a positive way our nii and earnings will benefit one final note on nii we added a slide in the appendix that shows the difference between when shortterm rates were last this low and today the important difference between then and now is the growth in our balance sheet which improved nii and the decline in expenses since then speaking of expenses and turning to slide  expenses were billion million lower than  the decline was driven by a reduction in litigation expense we also saw a reduction in covidrelated expenses primarily those associated with processing claims for unemployment insurance higher planned marketing costs across the firm and revenue related processing and incentives mitigated the reductions as we move into remember  will include seasonally higher payroll tax expense which we estimate at roughly million given the resurgence of covid cases across the us and in europe we estimate that million to million of net covidrelated expense remained in our  expenses we continued to work hard to lower these types of expense but not at the expense of the safety of our employees and customers and outside bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 of these covid costs we continued to manage expense tightly using gains and productivity and digital activity to mitigate other increases turning to asset quality on slide our total net chargeoffs this quarter were million or basis points of average loans net chargeoffs continued to benefit from years of responsible growth as well as government stimulus and loan deferral programs a million decline in net chargeoffs was driven by lower credit card losses the loss rate on credit card declined to a 20year low of basis points of average loans provision expense was million which not only reflected an improvement in macroeconomic projections but also incorporated uncertainties that remain in the economy due to the health crisis these considerations resulted in an million reserve release this quarter reducing consumer loan reserves by million and commercial by million our allowance as a percentage of loan releases ended the year at which is well above the where we began the year following our day adoption of the cecl accounting standards with respect to key variables used in setting our reserve as done in previous quarters we continued to include a number of downside scenarios based on our  weighting of those scenarios gdp is forecasted to return to its  level in the early part of this improved by a couple of quarters relative to  the weighting scenario also resulted in an unemployment rate at the end of consistent where it is today just north of on slide we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios on the consumer front covid effects on net chargeoffs continued to remain benign overall consumer net chargeoffs declined million driven by card losses and remained near historic lows we experienced modest increases in delinquency and npl levels but they remained low and were expected given the deferral activity of customers while expired deferrals drove consumer 30day delinquencies modestly higher compared to  importantly they remained below the yearago level and consumer deferral balances continued to decline in  ending the year at billion moreover balances are now mostly consumer real estate related with strong underlying collateral values we added a slide in our appendix which further highlights delinquency trends for credit card it shows a modest bulge of the expected deferral related delinquencies moving their way through time and into the bucket at yearend as the bulge of deferrals related to delinquencies passed through time periods delinquencies receded as an example in  fiveday delinquencies were down more than yearoveryear which shows that after deferrals pass through this time period delinquencies fell and stayed lower so assuming net losses follow their historical relationship to delinquencies in the 90plusday bucket and no other changes in card payment trends we would expect card losses to be higher in  but then decline in  moving to commercial net chargeoffs were relatively flat to  even as we sold some loans in affected industries crystallizing losses but reducing risk overall given the environment the asset quality of our commercial loan book remained solid and of exposures were either investment grade or collateralized our reservable criticized exposure metric continued to be the most heavily impacted by covid and increased this quarter by billion from  led by downgraded exposures in commercial real estate primarily hotels importantly commercial npls while up modestly remained low at only basis points of loans turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide consumer banking throughout has been the segment most impacted most heavily impacted by covid it bore the brunt of revenue disruption from interest rates customer activity and fee waivers reserve building impacted provision expense and expenses increased for ppp programs and protection of associates and customers bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 in  compared to  revenue expenses and provision all improved we earned billion in consumer banking in  versus billion in  but with earnings still below prior year prepandemic levels we know we still have plenty of room for improvement client momentum in this business continued to show strength around deposits and investment flows while near term loan growth has been impacted by the decline in mortgage balances from heightened refinance activity looking at the components of the pl linked quarter revenue growth included both higher nii and fees consumer fees reflected an increased level of holiday spending as well as higher investment account activity even as revenue moved higher expenses move modestly lower as we had a reduction in pandemic costs and continue to realize the benefits of a more digitally engaged customer base as brian noted and as you can see on slide we saw an improvement in digital enrollment most importantly customer use of our digital capabilities increased with not only more signons and higher digital sales but also more service fulfillment through digital channels as reflected by volume growth in both erica and zelle note also that both our rate paid and cost of deposits declined cost of deposits is now basis points in the past year we added over net new checking accounts grew deposits and dropped our cost of deposits basis points even with the increase in costs associated with the pandemic lets skip to wealth management on slides and and i will refer to both slides as i speak okay here again the impact of lower rates on a larger deposit book pressured nii impacting an otherwise solid quarter with positive aum flows market appreciation and solid deposit and loan growth net income of million improved from  as revenue growth and improvement in provision exceeded a modest increase in expense with respect to revenue nii grew driven by solid growth of both loans and deposits and asset management fees grew to a new record on higher market valuations and solid flows expenses increased driven by revenuerelated expense and investments in our sales force merrill lynch and the private bank both continue to grow households as we remained a provider of choice for affluent clients client balances rose to a record of more than trillion up billion yearoveryear driven by higher market levels as well as positive client flows lets move to our global banking results on slide covid has also heavily impacted global banking through lower interest rates softer loan demand and higher credit costs but here again we saw improvement the business earned nearly billion in  improving million from  driven by lower provision expense and improved revenue on a yearoveryear basis earnings were million lower driven by nii looking at revenue and comparing to  revenue improvement was driven by higher investment banking fees as well as more leasing activity associated with our clients esg investments investment banking fees for the company of nearly billion grew from  and were up year over year as brian noted this performance led to improved market share overall and in a number of key products provision expense reflected a reserved release of million in  compared to a build in reserves of million in  noninterest expense was higher compared to the linked quarter and yearoveryear primarily reflecting investments in the platforms as well as support for the ppp program and also reflecting the recording of merchant services expense given the change in accounting versus the year ago quarter as brian noted earlier bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 customers continued to appreciate the ease safety and convenience of our digital banking capabilities and usage continued to grow helping defray other costs we present some digital highlights on slide as noted earlier loans declined but saw stabilization late in the quarter and continuing the trend since  the spread of the loan portfolio continued to tick higher at spreads on new originations on average exceeded the average spread of the portfolio average deposits increased relative to  as businesses remained highly liquid okay switching to global markets on slide results reflect solid yearoveryear improvement in revenue from sales and trading but a decline from the robust levels of  as i usually do i will talk about segment results excluding dva this quarter net dva was a small loss of million on that basis global markets produced million of earnings in  a decline from the more robust trading in  but up markedly from  focusing on yearoveryear revenue was up on higher sales and trading the yearoveryear expense increase was driven by higher activitybased costs for both trading and unemployment claims processing sales and trading contributed billion to revenue increasing yearoveryear driven by a improvement in equities and a decline in ficc the strength in equities was driven by market volatility and investment repositioning which drove client activity higher the decline in ficc reflected strong credit trading performance which was more than offset by declines across most macro products and mortgage trading as brian noted the yearoveryear performance of this business has been strong in every quarter of you can see that on slide and that produced strong segment returns of on allocated capital for the year okay finally on slide we show all other which reported a loss of million compared to  the decline in net income was driven primarily by the prior quarters tax benefit of million associated with our uk deferred tax asset revenue decline from  driven by the accounting for wind and solar and other esg investments we also experienced some modest equity investment losses expenses declined from  on lower litigation expense but were partially offset by higher marketing costs for absent any changes in the current tax laws or unusual items we would expect the effective tax rate to be in the low double digits driven by the level of esg client activity relative to pretax earnings and with that ill turn it back to lee and brian for qa bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning i wanted to ask a question on expenses brian mentioned expecting the cost number to be flattish in versus just kind of wondering is that allin expenses paul or some kind of core metric if you can give an outlook for the expenses that you expect and the covid trend for covid expenses this year thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah john thats allin given the sort of around billion both years since we feel good about the ability to keep bringing down covid it came out a little slower this quarter largely due to the fact that if you go back and think where we were in october on case counts the need to continue to provide strong benefits to our teammates including the childcare in our homes so they could be effective thats why we get those customer scores and why the growth in checking sales was of the normal year with half the of branches closed so yeah flat yearoveryear following number and then well work in the dynamics underneath it but importantly remember we are investing billion in technology next year new financial centers expansion employees to help sell more and well continue to drive it through so youll see sort of a change in the covid costs coming down hopefully as we move through the year but weve got some work to do but flat yearoveryear overall john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then longer term brian youve talked about getting back to a low billion as kind of a run rate ex covid is that still how youre thinking about things brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah we should start to work down again as weve said many years ago as we get in the out years and get more and more efficient the daytoday the quotidian cost of rent increases and pay increases work at you but the idea is to have a net expense grow sort of at a year so up from just daytoday cost to manage a couple percents out and so well continue to work that down in the future weve got work to do on getting these covid expenses out of here john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks operator our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i also wanted to followup on the efficiency i mean youre making big strides with digital banking in so many ways with million digital households are engaged and you go through all those metrics and you see efficiency ratio for the quarter of and if you take out your million of covid costs maybe it would be but thats still a far cry from the to where you had been and i know low rates hurt a little bit but either youre investing more than youve disclosed or there are some other covid costs in there or youre not becoming more efficient as you said in your opening comments brian so help me kind of reconcile your current efficiency or my adjusted efficiency ratio with a more normal level brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so mike i take you back to page on the net interest yield and the net interest income and realize that basically in the four quarters last year we realized billion of revenue per quarter which is the bridge from a lot of that bridge and so as we work that back up and ultimately as rates rise that billion thats per quarter so billion in revenue with really no cost that will go up so we continue to get more efficient in our branches as the cost of operating over the deposit base is now basis points and we added new checking accounts so youre right but its more affected by the revenue impact to nii than it is by anything else in terms of expenses were saying net covid19 cost of million million that includes offsetting against all savings of travel and stuff the gross costs are obviously much higher than that we opened up ppp today weve got employees ready to go to complete the next round of ppp and the forgiveness process and as that finishes off that stuff will come out of the system so we got you mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then the follow up to that going to nii im not sure if you gave a specific outlook or not paul when you went through that i mean as you said liquidity is now greater than loans your loantodeposit ratio at close to i think its the lowest in history like ever right and also theres a lot of dry powder there but did you give guidance for nii for this year assuming the forward yield curve stays where it is and do you think you can somehow pull out positive operating leverage this year or is that too tough given the rate environment paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp we didnt give specific guidance i can give you a little more color on our perspective on but i do think as you think about how you want to estimate and model nii and how it may unfold in i think its really helpful to review the progress we made in theres a lot of clues there remember in  of interest rates fell to historically low levels short rates were down basis points and long rates were down basis points plus loans declined significantly beginning in  as demand weakened and larger companies assessed the capital markets to pay down debt and build liquidity in the past when weve had situations like this where interest rates andor loans have declined it always takes several quarters to reach a point where renewed balance sheet growth was significant enough to compensate we believe weve found that nii bottom in  and nii indeed moved higher in  all else equal day count etcetera it should become easier from here to grow nii bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 i think what helped us to start to grow again quickly in this crisis was the tremendous influx of deposits and our relatively recent confidence to invest the excess in securities instead of holding that excess in cash so our continued investment of that cash in  leads us to believe that we can offset the headwinds of low loan demand in the near term reinvestment yields and two less days of nii in  leaving nii relatively flat in  versus  before moving up through the balance of the year remember in  and  we picked back up those days of interest we lost in  as brian reviewed we also saw commercial loans stabilize at the end of  providing hope that increased loan demand will soon follow given that we expect some loan demand through the year and using the existing rate curve which has steepened over the past days we would expect nii in  for example to be much higher than  and when we get to the second half of yearoveryear quarterly comparisons to as well as the second half of compared to the first half of should be quite favorable mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful and then when you say a lot higher in  than  bigger than a breadbox or i mean any sizing to that brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp once we get the the simple way to think about it mike is once you sort of get underneath the levels you start growing the loan growth and wed said well outgrow the economy in loan growth in normalized times and that feeds the nii yeah but weve got to work it back up from here its a four or fivequarter fight to get this huge balance sheet turned and repositioned and just fight it down and have it grow back out so well see mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator and our next questions from glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much you guys are pretty predictable and steady on this front but im curious on your thoughts on capital im not sure your cet1s ever been higher and your requirements are not going up so as capital continues to build and your gsib target is reasonably low relative to your big peers just what are you thinking in terms of how aggressive do you get on the capital return versus we dont talk much about bolton acquisitions with you but curious how you think about that and if you might address asset management particularly given your great distribution franchise thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp then lets go backwards to that one the big leverage point but be more deposit acquisitions in markets were not and stuff like that but we cant do it its illegal and has been for all the way back since glba or whatever it was bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 or years ago so even before but and then asset management remember we sold our asset management because we believed that being the large distributor is the priority so dont expect us we look at stuff from time to time like everybody does but the way we built this company was organic growth and then delivering the capital back to the shareholders and whats interesting well see what the rules change but remember that things like the slr and the accommodations that were given we didnt need and we have plenty of slr it doesnt have any constraints it doesnt become an issue that like you said even if you look at the seb recalcs and stuff weve got plenty over that so we will be aggressive on returning capital weve got basically two months to return those billion and change weve got to return now and then well see what the fed instructions are and then well get after it as we move forward and we look at things from time to time but theres just isnt much to consider in the united states right now and the best answer is to continue development of this franchise on an organic basis and it works if you look in the markets where weve expanded our branch system to were averaging million or more in deposits per branch in the ones that have been open a couple of years and moving share up literally year by year by year and so we think thats where weve got to keep driving glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate all that is there a specific either buffer above the cet1 andor you want to put it in the billion excess wheres a natural resting ground not tomorrow but just whenever you get there brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp we always said sort of basis points above the relevant binding criteria is where youd start slow down but remember were basically only getting back to earnings and so we got a lot of room between us and whatever the requirements plus basis points and from time to time those move around events to standardize slr whatever is binding but think about thats where the board targets are glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks brian thanks for all that brian operator our next question is from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning can you talk a bit about the timing of the liquidity deployment in the fourth quarter i think mortgage rates actually came down and one could argue if you look out six to months longerterm rates will be higher as vaccines get rolled out and the economy picks up so obviously you have tons of deposits but its also pretty longduration assets i would think that youre buying so if you could talk about that paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 yeah youre absolutely right the year was up in the quarter but rates and mortgagebacked securities well certainly mortgage rates to customers declined and rates and mortgagebacked securities i think declined slightly having said that were always going to balance liquidity capital and returns in profits and we did deploy and as we said in our third quarter call approximately million of our cash and securities it went into both mortgagebacked securities and some treasuries in the quarter and we think that was the right thing to do we understand the rate structure we did get probably an improvement on our yield on that billion of approximately basis points so and i would say weve still got a lot of excess cash matt if you look at our balance sheet cash grew by billion billion this quarter so i mean that was the growth on top of what we are ready had net of deployment so we still have a lot of room to invest in the future and we plan to do some more investments in  but were obviously always looking at the rate environment matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then i guess somewhat related is there a point where you just say we dont want some of these deposits its better to free up even more capital or just have a little bit more of an efficient balance sheet and not have to make some of these tough decisions or charge for the deposits brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well so if a customer comes to you to open a checking account start a lifetime relationship youd never turn that down whether its a commercial customer or consumer customer for core deposits and so if you look at the growth were not bidding for cds and money markets on the consumer side you can see that billion to billion was checking account balance growth and by the way when rates rose before we continued our checking account growth and we would expect that to continue as these are core customer relationships so if you go back and look as rates rose we continue to grow checking in doubledigit type of numbers quarter after quarter after quarter which means youre just taking market share and so on the commercial side the same thing the gts business we are not out in the market taking shortterm deposits from people havent been and so this is all real core stuff that were getting paid to take and albeit it gets sandwiched a little bit as the zero floors are hit in the commercial side frankly that services overcome the zero floor but youd be hardpressed to turn it down so its not like we have a lot of heres a few billion dollars can you put on your balance sheet and give us that just doesnt happen we dont do that we turned that down already matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator our next questions from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey thanks paul just first off a followon question to the last one around the reinvestment into securities like you mentioned you did billion or so this past quarter so as were thinking about the nii guidance you just gave should we be anticipating an increase into the securities book thats above and beyond that roughly million run rate that you did in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp look we continue to assess the excess deposits and we do expect to continue to deploy more cash into securities were not really planning on disclosing how much more but there is a meaningful amount in that guidance that we gave you the size and pace of the purchases are obviously going to be influenced by a number of judgments including things like expected loan demand and customer deposit behavior so yeah im not going to give you a number but its a meaningful increase that were expecting to do in this quarter betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay got it and then just separately in talking about credit you indicated that the delinquencies are suggesting that your ncos are going to be coming down qonq in and its a pretty stunning statement given that we still have this unemployment rate where it is can you just talk a little bit about why you would expect thats happening in your book of business do you just have a population thats really not being impacted by the unemployment rate maybe if you could give us some color there paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp sure now i want to correct i think i heard you say something you may not have said it but i want to make sure everybody heard it we expect ncos for card to be up in audio gap its not going to be down in  and the reason for that brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hey paul paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hey paul we lost you there for a second just as you said what you were saying paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah okay sorry well i wanted to make sure everybody heard because i thought i heard you say something different we expect that chargeoffs per card which obviously the primary driver of consumer losses we expect those to be up in  and then decline in  and the uptick betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thats what i thought i said so sorry about that bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp okay and that expectation is being driven by what we see in the 90day plus bucket in terms of delinquencies and those delinquencies if you look at the other buckets youll see in the 90day plus bucket theyre higher than the other bucket and thats the deferrals have worked their way from the 5day to 30day the to day theyre now in the 90day bucket and we can look back historically and say x percent of our delinquencies in the 90day bucket show up as losses in the next quarter because you get to days and so thats all were seeing but importantly when you look behind the 90day bucket you dont see the same elevated levels in fact if you look at the 30day bucket youre down meaningfully yearoveryear in terms of levels betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp so thats why we think  will have to come down probably maybe have to is too strong of a word all else equal would you think it would come down and the question is really if you think about it the people who have been affected by this health crisis who are unemployed who have been helped by stimulus will this new stimulus carry them to the point where they get vaccinated and they get jobs back and will we ever see those losses or will they just be pushed out into future periods brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so just to give you some extra information we included if you look at page of the deck and the appendix and the four charts at the bottom were put in specifically because this question we knew would arise so if you look across the buckets and you look from the mid2019 to the end of you can see the different delinquency buckets are all down even the 90plus days down a gross dollar amount yearoveryear but you can see that what people thought was the analogy of a pig through a snake is probably more of a mouse or a snake in that it went up its still a lower dollar amount and it would come back down because you move from the left to the right side of page and if you go back to page you can actually see in the top chart that the total chargeoffs in consumer this quarter were million if you look at the red bars which is the credit card you can see that they are down dramatically yearoveryear in terms of gross dollar amounts and then this will bode well in the future so when we talk about going back up theyre going up to a level that was much below where they had ever been historically in terms of dollar amounts and so the last point you made just say you have it is that the unemployment rate in our customer base is below the unemployment rate in american society and thats just due to especially on the borrowing customer base due to the client selection and being in the prime business paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp hey betsy maybe just to complete the conversation with respect to commercial we have seen increases in reservable criticized but we havent seen npls increase significantly theyre at basis points of loans right now so we think commercial losses in future quarters are going to be driven by really companyspecific events bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 that play out over the coming quarters and will obviously likely be concentrated in industries more heavily impacted by covid i would point out that in this quarter we took some losses as we chose to reduce exposures in industries that were affected by covid and that crystallized some losses and shown up on our ncos this quarter if we hadnt taken those losses we wouldve hadnt sold those credits we wouldve had even lower ncos in commercial betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah now i get it were forecasting ncos peaking sometime in the end of but given your comments maybe the question is have they already peaked or will they have peaked for you in like brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp the care there is to think the consumer is really this point sort of run the course and the commercial reserves have built and the activity may occur in the out quarters but the consumer runs of course by just straight throughput to days to days to days so were showing you the charts that really tell you whats going to happen in the first half and because its a pretty mathematical calculation betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yes now i got it impressive thank you operator next question is from vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey brian hey paul brian a question for you can you talk a little bit about the effect in trading youve lost share in including in what are you thinking about this business what are your plans for it brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well our plans are to keep running it the way we do and if you look at it yearoveryear its an integrated business markets jim does a good job we showed you on that chart its up its one of the highest years its ever had or whatever it is up yearoveryear so they do a great job we dont play in certain areas which run on a given quarter interesting enough when they dont run people forget about that and so we have more of a stable level of revenue so if you look on page youll see that billion billion billion billion so we had a good year and the ficc was up from billion to billion in revenue which was substantial and some areas we dont trade in so were more creditdriven and thats what drives us versus some of the competitors were happy with the business they do a great job and its really there to help drive the connectivity between our issuing clients and our investing clients and well continue to drive it paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 can i just add one indiscernible happy to see what data youre looking at but i dont think were losing market share in ficc i think were actually gaining market share but perhaps not as much as were gaining in equities but were gaining market share certainly in the segments where were investing within ficc vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc paul your growth rates have been below peer so are you doing that by segment of business like brian was talking about and parsing that out between commodities and macro and credit products or is it something else because certainly if we look at yearonyear growth rates youve been below your peers through several quarters in paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp some of the peers but not all of the peers vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp theres lots of peers in europe vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right the bigger ones yeah but i guess paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp so if you look at indiscernible youll see that we are gaining market share in ficc vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay well go back and compare with the europeans different question paul for you mbs premium amortization expense what was that this quarter paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp i dont think were giving the exact number but it was up and it did impact i would say meaningfully nii from here were going to need to see customer mortgage rates stabilize and go higher for that number to stabilize and go higher excuse me if that one was to stabilize and go lower vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i understood what you meant yeah bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah but ill give you this sense of its impact though if you look at the decline in net interest yield for the company a third of it was due to premium amortization in the quarter vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and so by the time the fourth quarter guide that you were giving us for nii to be much better how much of a reversal are you forecasting in that mbs premium amortization in that guide paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i would look at the forward rates to get it for you to estimate that were not assuming that it goes up in that guidance because if you look at the forward curve rates by the end of the year are up from where they are today vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah yeah no i was yeah my question was how much are you expecting it to decline paul and i know indiscernible expected to grow paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp i understand youre asking for the dollar amount and im not going to give you the dollar amount vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc not the dollar amount but any sense of percentage since you said onethird of the decline came from that any sense of im not asking for the precise dollar amount paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah yeah vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc im not expecting that but any sense paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp maybe we can followup i mean i dont have it off the top of my head i could probably give you some sense of how much what percent of the improvement is from that but i just dont have it off the top of my head the other thing i would point out just to keep in mind as youre thinking about the writeoff of premium is that its not just at this point due to the decline in rates you have to remember that the portfolio has gotten bigger too bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great but youve been hurt more than others by it so obviously that should turn around for you later in the year if refis starts to slow paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah thats a meaningful sort of tailwind if mortgage rates increase vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thanks operator next question is from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning just one accounting followup for you paul just you mentioned the low doubledigit tax rate and that other fee line for where the esg investments go through has been pretty volatile but a pretty big negative number and i just wanted to see if theres any way you can help us understand just what that looks like when youre helping us understand the tax rate as the other side of it paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah sure i can try to help you with that i guess theres two ways to triangulate on it look at the other income line for the company okay and with respect to modeling that line its going to bounce around a lot quarterto quarter but for modeling purposes a good assumption going forward absent unusual items would be about a loss of million in that line except the fourth quarter will normally be higher as it was this year given the seasonal increase in partnership investments that we saw this quarter i can give you a lot more theres lots of things in that line item but the volatility is often driven certainly in the fourth quarter by those partnership losses other things in that line are equity investment gains gains and losses on the sale of debt securities and theres some marktomarket income in there on our fbo loans fair value loans and related hedges so theres going to be volatility in there i would use a loss of around million per quarter with a larger loss in the fourth quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah understood okay great and then just a followup just on you mentioned the progress that has been happening in the franchise as we kind of get a little bit closer to reopening a lot of those card and consumer related fee items are still kind of hanging in there plus or minus what do we think needs to happen for those to start moving the right way obviously youve got all this excess liquidity still weighing on fees and overdrafts etcetera so is this a new normal or with the economic improvement do you expect to see also that stuff start massive fees start to improve as well bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp the biggest line item is the interchangetype dynamics in both debit and credit and theyre growing but theyre recovering from a deficit as i spoke about earlier so yes that should help and then the numbers of transaction accounts go up but remember weve had a strategy that is to lower a clients overdraft charges by our safebalance account which are million accounts round numbers and were trying to get customers to really use our services in a way that benefits them the most and so that works against the overdraft line as the sheer dollar volume goes up so well see but whats really also driving us is just sheer numbers of growth in accounts will be the driver itll grow slowly though because we have been constantly taking down we have the lowest percentage of overdrafts as total fees in consumer of any of the large peers and well continue to drive that down because that means the customers in good shape ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay last thing any quick update on the merchant and how thats progressing along as well now that weve seen another kind of full quarter of that broken out brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah i think its still getting weve put the new system in and were starting to sell it we feel okay we feel its a core part of our business but one of the things thats held it back is thats a sales process which is more integral to the types of people that use merchant services to be open more and thats obviously affected by covid so its okay but we need to improve it ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right got it thank you brian operator next question is from jim mitchell with seaport global please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey good morning maybe just a little bit on consumer loan growth it seems like you deliberately shrunk residential mortgage auto looked pretty good but credit card was a little sluggish i think given typical seasonality so customers are flush with cash how do we think about the demand for lending going forward you gave some nice color on the commercial side on a monthly basis how do we think about the consumer side brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well let me just the issue was if you think about being a large consumer lender and especially you watch the unsecured space when march april may hit you pulled in and even in the small business space so the good news is that were reverting to norm and so in december for example we had booked accounts in credit card thats the highest really going back to precovid days but we were running back then so weve got some work to do to get it back to the full amount on the card side for example bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 in terms of mortgage again we were careful there but also were conservative on rates and weve gone to look at that so we booked about billion in the unsecured lending side including mortgage in the core consumer business and so we feel better about that auto picked back up but home equity is down to billion a quarter or something like that when it was running billion or something so weve got some room to go but the good news is the cards stable the balances are sort of stabilized at the million you have some seasonality but at least they stabilized there and then the mortgage looks like were picking back up a bit as weve made some adjustments and gone back to the more normalized underwriting and autos been strong so well see it play out but youre right we had to pull back and that lost about half the credit card volume on a given month and were picking back up from at the low point to but weve got some work to do james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities so is the uptick in marketing spend sort of reflective of that push to reengage with consumer and we should expect some nice brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities sort of improvement going forward brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp all our marketing really is around consumer product capabilities so yes james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities okay great thank you operator our next question is from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning brian brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning paul bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp hi gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc brian just to followup on that consumer commentary you gave and in your prepared remarks i think you said that youre bringing your underwriting standards back to the precovid levels two questions i guess or two parts to it can you give us some color of how they changed when you tightened them up now theyre back to normal was it fico scores on the consumer side and was it also on the commercial side did you do the same thing and some color around whats changed today there brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah so let me start with the commercial side and this is about sort of the relationship side of the commercial business business banking global commercial banking global corporate investment banking basically in marchapril we stopped prospecting frankly because it was sort of impossible to do plus you want to make sure you understood the portfolios weve done quarterly portfolio reviews every single loan going through to make sure the ratings are right make sure we understood where the customer stood make sure we understood whether theyre going to need covenant waivers that over the course of the time here has sorted the group of customers which are in the industries that paul talked about that are difficult and the rest of the customers are solid in good shape and frankly their credit has been improving as we looked at it by quarter and so about four months ago we moved into prospecting with very narrow list of prospects for business banking commercial banking big four middle market and upper end of small business across our markets then recently we flipped and they can go back to full prospecting except for limited industries that youd expect in the small business side because of the nature of the business it was a little more dramatic and weve opened back up and were getting were up i think in the fourth quarter to give you a sense we were up in terms of originations quarteroverquarter but were still were up a lot more than that more than were still down yearoveryear up 100plus percent in quarter to linked quarter i think and so new commitments up but yearoveryear still down so that shows you thats coming through and we will see that happen on the small business side so that was probably the slowest because they are the most at risk and so thats the commercial side when you go to the consumer side the reality was we basically we stayed on ltvs on the commercial on the consumer mortgage side we basically stopped with the fico requirements we slowed down and do the market dynamics home equity slowed down auto we went back out more quickly just because of secured nature of it the shortterm nature of it so we felt good about that and probably were always superprime and stayed there but its really whats changed in consumer in the last few months has been the move and were back to probably of the ability to generate that we had we were down probably and we moved back up and so well see that flow through but it was really just until you had some clarity where this thing was going you had to be careful for a while so that bodes well to economic activity and loan growth in the future gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you and then paul in your comments you were talking about having greater confidence with the deposits to go further out on the yield curve you talked a little bit about that already i guess the question is bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 what changed on the confidence side that now youre comfortable to take those deposits and move them further out versus maybe six months ago paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp sure so whats changed is a the level of deposits right we continue to get more and more deposits in b reviewing as brian noted earlier where the deposits are coming from predominantly highquality deposits checking etcetera new accounts three when you look at just the sheer growth of the money supply coupled with the expectation as we come out of this recession that the velocity of money will likely increase its hard to build a case that were going to see a significant decline in deposits in the us and were going to get our fair share if not more of those deposits so because of how we run our business on both commercial and the retail side in terms of focusing on highquality deposits we just feel good about the deposits we have brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah and gerard just to make it sort of straightforward once you got by the feeling that this was an ephemeral move and especially on the corporate side that this was going to stay with you you could be a little more interested in the consumer side you always know those are going to hang but the reality is the big inflow on the commercial side you had to make sure it wasnt ephemeral gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and brian and paul hopefully well see you guys at baab this year in person brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well try paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp hope so gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you gentlemen operator next question is from brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thanks i just have one question its regarding the reserve levels overall i guess when you think about it i know there was some changes with this quarter driven i think by qualitative factors but i guess when you look at relative to the base case how much of the reserve is still related to qualitative factors meaning that if the base case comes true that could be released over time bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah i dont im not sure we well im not sure we give the exact methodology but let me just give you a sense if you take our reserve setting weighting in other words what we set the reserve by december for year end because we set it before the statistics the unemployment rate was and for year end it was and obviously the actual was basis pointsplus below that so you would expect as you have more confidence that the forward path is into a narrow range in the forward probability two things are going to happen as you go forward one is the sheer dollar volumes of activity has changed and so youre dealing with less in terms of chargeoffs and things like that which gives you confidence of where the path is but most importantly as you think about real reserve setting and lifetime reserves is that the economic assumptions are clarifying and the end of the covid era is clarifying with the vaccine and as we see that youll see the uncertainty come down pretty quickly on the other side of that when that shows up in our assumptions so we weighted downside nearly of the elements that weighting will come down over time and so when that comes down over time youll see the reserves releases come away from that the second thing is as the duration of the rest of the crisis comes in with more certainty ie more people vaccinated you also see the lifetime calculation include the other side of the river to a bigger bigger portion and so that will drive it so both those things will change it and as paul said earlier if you look at our underlying economics team they have the economy crossing over where it was before and growing past in terms of sheer size the end of this year and our reserve setting takes it into next year and things like that so we are using a more conservative case which implies judgment brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks operator well take todays last question from charles peabody with portales please go ahead charles w peabody q analyst portales partners the first deals with whats going on in the regulatory front recently we just had two new potential appointees one to the sec and one to the cfpb wondering what sort of issues you thought might emerge with these appointees and more on the consumer side because thats what im hearing where the biggest opportunity is going to be some of the things im hearing theres going to be a crackdown on payday lending overdraft fees usurious rates artificial intelligence used in redlining most of those probably wouldnt affect you less than overdraft fees but are there anything you can think of that might affect you and specifically what sort of things might affect overdraft fees brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well a decadeplus ago we started changing before the rules were changed our posture in overdraft fees realizing that a more stable customer base was vastly better for the franchise than the operating efficiency and so we welcome an industry which has a great consumeroriented path to it because thats how we run our company weve been doing it that way for a long time so our fees on overdrafts have been declining really as a percentage of fees every year and probably in gross dollar amounts most years and so were not dependent on those largely because of how we run the business being core customer check plus the primary checking bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 account and the household and therefore they tend to overdraft less and this year with the stimulus and stuff its even lower so we welcome we introduced this new loan product that basically gives a right to get an emergency loan for and that is our response to allowing our customers who have been with us for a while to access their money for really no interest at all and use it in anticipation of paying us back quickly these are things that weve done to really help our retail customer segment which is the mass market customer segment manage their lives effectively and so we dont have a business built on those kind of fee structures and were not thats why we welcome any regulation that brings the market to us because as the most efficient and the best brand and the best customer service largest franchise thats fine with us charles w peabody q analyst portales partners and my followup question deals with i recognize the fourth quarter on a historical basis was very very strong indiscernible trading revenues didnt indiscernible and so my question is indiscernible a little more conservative in the fourth quarter we already have for the year indiscernible making it more difficult indiscernible lee mcentire a senior vice presidentinvestor relations bank of america corp hey charlie youre really cutting out this is lee youre really cutting out im not sure we picked up i think you were asking a question about ficc and something but we couldnt hear you charles w peabody q analyst portales partners yeah basically the ficc trading results in the fourth quarter on a historical basis were very strong but they didnt miss analyst estimates not just bofa but at jpmorgan at citi at goldman everybody im trying to understand is there something in the environment thats changing thats making it more difficult indiscernible too aggressive in their expectations brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp that i dont develop those expectations but our team had a good year and jim and the team drove the business well they do it consistent with how we run the franchise keeping the balance sheet a third of the balance sheet in the billion of capital we have in the markets business and for the year we earned well above our cost of capital and they did it think about the environments almost by month that were shaped so we feel good about it and so ill let lee follow you offline to some of the broader questions but we dont set other peoples estimates we only set our own so let me i think that was the last caller lee lee mcentire a senior vice presidentinvestor relations bank of america corp thats right brian bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp okay thanks let me finish here and let you get back to your day lets close the book on that it was a strong year by the team as we think about what we faced a wild operating environment with work from home massive customer deferrals that diminished over the course of the year massive borrowing that paid us back deposit inflows government programs to implement changes in those government programs multiple cases of those government programs and yet the team did a great job so i thank the team for all the hard work they did we finished the year stronger than the stronger quarter of the three during the crisis we continue to see asset quality mitigate now and so we feel good were back in the market buying back stock today we told you well buy billionplus this quarter our strong balance sheet and capital ratios allow us to do that and as we also said nii dropped in the third quarter and we continue to push up from here and expenses
