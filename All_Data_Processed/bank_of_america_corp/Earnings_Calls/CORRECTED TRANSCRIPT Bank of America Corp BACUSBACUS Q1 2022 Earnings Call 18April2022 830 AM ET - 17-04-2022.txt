to all of you and thank you for joining us as we open our earnings call this quarter we want to acknowledge that theres the humanitarian crisis continuing to take place in ukraine and we remain watchful and have provided assistance from our company to the ukrainian citizens and stand ready to help further where we can before we get into some discussion on the current outlook and activity i want to step back and focus on the big picture about bank of america this quarter in a quarter that had a lot of variables show up we delivered responsible growth again we reported billion in net income or per diluted share we grew revenue we reduced costs and we delivered our third straight quarter of operating leverage coming out of the pandemic net interest income grew and is expected to grow significantly from here we saw strong loan growth we grew deposits we saw strong investment flows we made trading profits every day during the quarter we grew pretax preprovision income by we had a return on tangible common equity of all this came in a quarter that saw geopolitical conflict rising interest rates the pandemic rising inflation concerns and much much more i want to thank our team for delivering on responsible growth once again bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 so as you look at the statistics on slide you can see some of those highlights you can see the organic growth engine that our company is delivering once again in our banking business you can see the strong loan and deposit growth we grew and expanded customer relationships across every business in fact we grew net new checking accounts by more than this quarter alone we opened new financial centers and we renovated many others we added more digital capabilities and crossed in digital sales in our wealth management businesses you can see over billion of client flows over the year and more than trillion in client balances including merrill edge we saw both strong investment flow performance in addition to banking flows over the past year we brought on a significant number of net new households in the merrill and another in the private bank across the combination of our consumer and wealth businesses we saw more than billion of investment flows weve now had managed client balances including deposits and loan investments of more than trillion with us in global markets jimmy demare and his team had a solid quarter of sales and trading results which included a record quarter for equities and despite the market turmoil we had zero days trading losses while the investment banking fee line was down from the record quarters of the past year matthew koder and his team put in solid results with a strong forward pipeline and we gained market share in several areas including moving to number two in midcap investment banking from a broader enterprise perspective part of managing costs well comes from the drive we have in the company to provide enhanced digital capabilities to our customers which in turn drives adoption further digital engagement and lower cost if you look at slide and beyond you can see we are now selling more digitally than we are in person it takes both to be successful what makes it even more impressive is all the financial centers are now open and back to operating at their usual great capacity so adding the digital capacity clearly increases our total production capabilities you could also see our digital sales are now twice the prepandemic level just three years ago even more impressive look at zelle and erica volumes up more than times from the prepandemic levels were now processing more outgoing zelle transactions than checks in our cashpro mobile app for the commercial clients we see many billion usage days there are a lot more stats on those slides showing strong digital growth i indiscernible you to see how a hightouch hightech innovative company drives organic growth this quarter our resilience was tested and once again we maintained a focus on what we can control and grew responsibly and earned our way through the turmoil so we talked to you during the quarter many of you expressed questions about the impact of the macro environment and changes in our company the lingering impact of the pandemic on supply chains and business opportunities inflation and fed reduction of monetary accommodation the impacts of the russianukraine war both on the firstorder effect and secondorder effects we do remain mindful of all these so could a slowdown in the economy happen perhaps but right now the size of the economy is bigger than prepandemic levels consumer spending remains strong unemployment is low and wages are rising company earnings are also generally strong credit is widely available and our customers uses of their lines of credit is still low ie they have capacity to borrow more we are all focused on the ability of the fed to use their tools to reduce inflation we all know that will take interest rate hikes and a reduction in the balance sheet we predict it will slow the economy from growth in to a little below in that is back to track so with interest rate hikes comes better nii does the fed have to push harder to slow inflation perhaps that is why we run stress tests each quarter to look at scenarios to see what would happen in a highly inflationary environment bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 if rates move up fast are there implications to capital sure and you saw some this quarter but in the context of the capital built those impacts are manageable the impact increases earnings also and then over time the bonds pull back to par all that results in a rebuild of the capital quite quickly but for some short period of time that capital usage along with customer usage might slow share repurchases a bit but it will be temporary what if were wrong and things do get tough we already know what that looks like in as we built significant reserves we also built basis points of capital during the economic shutdown period rates moved against us and earnings fell so we have already proven resilience we continue to focus on responsible growth and the things we control if you go to slide i want to mention show some of the strengths we see in our us consumer base bank of america consumers spent at the highest ever quarter one level which is a doubledigit percentage increase over the level that you can see in the upper left from our card spend data we have seen a strong recovery in travel entertainment and restaurant spending in the upper right you can see that by the way even with fuel costs up or more from last year fuel represents about of overall debit and credit card spending and a lot less of overall spending as cards you can see in the lower left is of all spending importantly despite march of last year including the stimulus bonus we saw the spending in the month of march on a comparable basis to higher by dollar volume and we saw a increase in the number of transactions so both dollar volumes and numbers of transactions rose nicely and as you expect the methods by which people spend continues to shift away from cash and checks and replaced with digital alternatives and you can see that below our data shows continued growth in the average deposit balance across all customer levels which suggests capacity for strong spending continuing on an aggregated basis average deposit balances were up from prepandemic levels and higher than and the momentum continued through quarter one particularly in the low balance account which grew in february to march continuing a streak since mid last year now a couple of examples so you can see how this works we looked at the prepandemic customers who had to of cleared balance with bac today they had an at that time prepandemic they had an average balance of if you take that same cohort of customers the same customers in versus and they have an average cleared balance now of so an increase from to if you go to the next cohort up those with to of cleared balances in the prepandemic their average was now those same customers today have an average cleared balance of what does that tell us the consumers are sitting on lots of cash why is this true well you know high wage growth high savings by limited enabled spending but what it means is theres a long tail to consumer spend growth and in april through the first two weeks spending is growing even faster at over april of another economic signpost is the continuation of loan growth a year ago we highlighted the green shoots of our loan growth we then delivered growth in quarter two and quarter three and quarter four despite ppp runoff and the changing economic conditions to convey where we are today we focus on ending loans to give you a progression through the quarter if you go to slide you can see the highlights of that growth in the upper left of the slide i would remind you that in quarter four we highlighted to you that of the billion of growth in that single quarter billion was global markets and we did not expect that to hold true for quarter one of so as we thought global markets did come down billion this quarter despite that overall commercial loans grew billion from quarter four excluding ppp that means commercial loans excluding global markets grew billion every single customer group global banking large corporate middle market business banking grew as well as bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 commercial loans in wealth management that improvement came from both new loans as well as improving utilization rates from existing clients you can see in the top chart loans have moved back above our prepandemic levels on the righthand side of the slide and you can see it being led by commercial consumer loans continued to grow linked quarter as well this is despite typical seasonality and despite the continued suppressed credit card balances you can see in the lower left mortgage loans grew billion originations remained at high levels and paydowns declined card loans declined billion from quarter four driven by the transfer of billion ph thats in the card loan portfolio to the heldforsale category absent that transfer card loans would have declined very modestly whereas in previous quarter one quarters theyve declined several billion on slide we provide data around consumer clients leverage and asset qualities compared to prepandemic periods which further supports our belief that consumer remains in good shape on the upper left we looked at our customers that had both a credit card and a deposit account with us as you will note the average card balance of our credit card customers that had deposit relationships are still lower than they were pre pandemic they continued to pay down their balances on a monthly basis at a higher rate than prepandemic and as you know delinquency rates are significantly lower further as you can see to my earlier point these borrowing customers have built significant additional savings and their average deposit balances are up so a lot of strength or dry powder as its called so what if we went to the modest fico more modest amount of low fico customers we have at bac looking at that small subset of our base you see a similar trend even stronger on cash balances and lower debt levels and you see it in the bottom charts we believe this is not just a phenomenon at bac as industry data points around debt service levels are hovering near historic lows and household deposit and cash levels are trillion higher than we entered the crisis now a word on russia this is not an area of material direct exposure for bank of america more than a decade ago we reduced our exposure in russia and it has resulted in having less before the most recent crisis our current very limited activities in russia are focused on compliance with all sanctions and other legal and regulatory requirements our lending and counterparty exposure to companies based in russia totals approximately million and is limited to nine russianbased borrowers it is largely comprised of top tier commodity exporters with a history of strong cash flows who continue to make payments prior to the ukraine invasion these exposures were mostly investment grade we report all of them on our reservable criticized our quarter one allowance includes increased reserves for this direct exposure and id just note that even with the addition of these loans to reservable criticized we still declined billion in this category during the first quarter we continue our daily monitoring of sanctions and interest payments that might impact these loans we also evaluate our portfolios and continue to do so considering secondorder impacts of this crisis currently we believe this to be modest and reflect our international strategy to focus on large multinational clients that have geographically diverse operations our quarter one allowance for credit losses reflects all of these things as well on russian counterparty risk our teams have done a tremendous job ph in managing down our exposures and at the end of the quarter we had de minimis meaning less than million counterparty exposure with a single russianbased counterparty and very limited impacts from indiscernible impacts in our trading results for this quarter so responsible growth has served us well here and as you might note after the crimea conflict we intentionally reduced our exposure and russia has not been in our top country risk exposure table since bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 so a few comments on nii on nii remember the rate increases came late in the quarter and had little first quarter nii impact and there were two fewer days of interest in the quarter and decreased ppp fees ph hurt nii growth yet we still grew nii by million in line with our guidance we gave you last quarter given the forward curve expectation for higher interest rates and our expectations of further loan growth we expect significant nii improvement through the next several quarters alastair will expand on this point for you we have more than trillion of deposits and trillion of those are with our consumer and wealth management clients with more than of those in low to no interest checking that is a franchise that isnt viable we will benefit as the rates move off the zero floors allowing us to earn more money on those checking deposits on deposits i know several of you are wondering if deposits continue to grow as rates begin to rise so we went back and looked at the last rate rising cycle in the last decade we pinpointed the peak rate paid to customers during the quarter reflective of the peak fed tightening we then went back and looked at the months preceding growth rate in deposits in effect during that months preceding that peak deposits grew driven by organic growth engine our market share gains and overall economic growth if you go to page slide you can see the common equity ph well talk about capital just to start off our capital remains strong with cet1 ratio well above our minimum requirement as you can see billion of earnings net of preferred dividends generate basis points of capital as you look on the righthand side of the page you can see that basis points of that capital was used to support our customers growth thats a good thing we also returned billion to shareholders in common dividends and share repurchase will represent about basis points of use the spike in treasury and mortgagebacked securities rates caused the fair value of our afs debt securities to decrease and lowered our cet1 by basis points thats the part that goes to the calculation of the capital while one wouldnt expect this impact every quarter were wellpositioned we were wellpositioned for the spike as you recall weve invested much of our securities books in heldtomaturity due to our huge excess in stable deposit base we have trillion of deposits and less than trillion in loans in addition to be cautious we hedge a large portion of securities in the afs portfolio protecting it from much larger hit to aoci ill remind you as the securities mature the aoci reverses and the higher rates result in higher nii over a relatively short period of time that should result in higher earnings that will benefit cet1 ratios on an ongoing basis and more than offset the negative upfront aoci impacts the last thing i would note is our balance sheet growth to support our customer means our gsib buffer will probably move higher by basis points beginning in ie to regulatory minimums while this is nearly two years away we continue to move towards it given this new higher minimum over the next couple of years well look to gradually move to target cet1 range of towards importantly while we grow into this range well be able to support our clients well be able to continue to increase our dividends and well be able to continue to buy back stock with that let me turn it over to alastair alastair borthwick chief financial officer bank of america corp thank you brian and ill start with the summary income statement on slide where you can see our comparisons illustrating yearoveryear operating leverage produced by growing revenue and managing our bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 costs well that was nearly enough to overcome the change in provision expense driven by the billion reserve release in the yearago period compared to a million release this quarter on asset quality more broadly we continue to see very strong metrics net chargeoffs remained low and in fact theyre down more than in just the past year consumer early and late stage delinquencies are still below levels and reservable criticized moved lower again in  looking ahead we continue to feel good about the asset quality results of our consumer and commercial businesses near term given our customers high liquidity low unemployment and rising wages we produced good returns again this quarter with an rotce of nearly and we delivered billion of capital back to shareholders driving average shares lower by yearoveryear looking forward and with continued expectations of growing nii combined with strong expense control we expect to drive operating leverage and see our efficiency ratio work back towards lets turn to slide and the balance sheet and you can see during the quarter our balance sheet grew billion to a little more than trillion this reflected billion of growth in loans and the growth of our global markets balance sheet as customers increased their activity with us a decline in cash this quarter was associated with that growth in global markets our liquidity portfolio was stable compared to yearend and at trillion it represents roughly a third of the balance sheet shareholders equity declined billion from  with a few different components i would note shareholders equity benefited from net income after preferred dividends of billion as well as issuance of billion in preferred stock so thats billion that flowed into equity in  and we paid out billion in common dividends and share repurchases aoci declined as a result of the spike in loan rates that brian referenced and we saw the impact in two ways first we had a reduction from a change in the value of our afs debt securities that was billion thats the piece that impacts cet1 as brian noted and second rates also drove a billion decline in aoci from derivatives that does not impact cet1 that reflects cash flow hedges against our variable rate loans which provide some nii growth and protected cet1 at the same time with regard to regulatory capital since brian already talked about cet1 id simply note that our supplemental leverage ratio was stable at versus the minimum requirement of and still leaves us plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth and our tlac ratio remains comfortably above our requirements turning to slide we included the schedule on average loan balances and in the interest of time the only thing i would add to brians earlier comments and for your perspective is simply a reminder that ppp loans are down billion yearoveryear theres just a few billion of those left and excluding ppp our total loans grew billion or compared to last year moving to deposits on slide first lets look at yearoveryear growth and across the past months we saw solid growth across the client base as we deepened relationships and added net new accounts our yearover year average deposits are up billion or retail deposits with our consumer and wealth management businesses grew billion and our retail deposits have now grown to more than trillion where we lead all competitors looking at linked quarter growth from  and combining consumer and wealth management customer balances our retail deposits grew billion in just the past days with our commercial clients theyre up nicely year overyear and we simply note the  decline which is entirely consistent with previous years seasonal trends bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 turning to slide and net interest income on a gaap nonfte basis nii in  was billion and the fte nii number was billion so ill focus on fte where net interest income has now increased billion from the first quarter last year as brian noted thats increase driven by deposits growth and our related investment of liquidity nii was up million versus the fourth quarter as the benefits of lower premium amortization and loans growth more than offset the headwinds of two less days of interest accruals and lower ppp fees so lets pause for a moment to discuss asset sensitivity because i want to make a couple of points as we begin what the fed has signaled to be a significant rate hike period remember asset sensitivity is our measure of nii for the next months above an expected baseline of nii given changes in interest rates and other assumptions in an environment of sharply rising rates each quarter the baseline of nii actual nii increases and therefore the future sensitivity declines now we typically disclose our asset sensitivity based on a basis point instantaneous parallel shock in rates above the forward curve and on that basis asset sensitivity at march was billion of expected nii over the next months and of that sensitivity is driven by short rates that billion is down from billion at yearend largely because higher rates are now factored into and running through our actual or baseline nii now you asked the question last quarter about the same sensitivity on a spot basis relative to our current curve and given that the yield curve is projecting basis points of rate hikes over the next three meetings we thought it was appropriate to provide that disclosure so in a basis point shock to the current curve using spot rates our sensitivity to that kind of move would be billion or billion higher than on a forward basis so assuming rising rates as reflected in todays forward curve and if we see continued loans growth i would just reiterate what we said last quarter that we expect to see robust nii growth in compared to were not going to provide numerical guidance for the full year because the changes in interest rates have proven quite volatile in just the last days let alone a year we do provide that asset sensitivity so that you can use it as guardrails to think about changes as you modify your own assumptions i do however want to provide a nearer term expectation and say that if loans grow and rates in the forward curve materialize we would expect to see nii in  increase by more than million over the  level and then grow again significantly on a sequential basis in each of the following two quarters okay lets turn to expenses and well use slide for that discussion our  expenses were billion down a couple hundred million from the year ago period ill focus my remarks on the more recent comparison versus  where were up million and as expected and we conveyed to you last quarter the  increase was driven mostly by seasonality of payroll tax expense of roughly million we also experienced modestly higher wage and benefit costs as we look forward we continue to invest heavily in technology people and marketing across our lines of business and weve continued to add new financial centers in expansion and growth markets we modestly increased our full year new tech initiative budget for the year to billion and thats on top of more than billion that we put to work over the past years to help us build powerful more secure and scalable technology platforms this is the investment thats allowed us to maintain a leadership position in patents than some of our peers we had of them granted in and were maintaining a similar pace this year we think this is one of the things thats helping us to protect our moat around leadership positions in places that matter most to customers bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 in addition to modestly higher marketing costs this year our investments also include adding up to new financial centers and we also plan to renovate more than more during the year we will also continue our upward march on minimum hourly wage toward by so how do we pay for all that through continued work on operational excellence and digital engagement and as we look to  we expect our expenses to be down modestly from  as much of the seasonal payroll tax expense abates and is somewhat offset by investment timing inflation and the costs of opening up more fully for travel and client entertainment because it feels like weve got a lot of pentup demand for facetoface meetings by our clients and our people so lets turn to asset quality on slide and as you can see asset quality of our customers remains very healthy net chargeoffs this quarter were better than our expectations once again and remained below million down compared to  provision expense was million in  as reserve release of million closely matched net chargeoffs in the quarter and that reserve release was primarily in our consumer portfolios on slide we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios and im happy to answer any questions later but a couple things are worth repeating consumer delinquencies remain well below prepandemic levels and despite reporting our commercial russian lending exposure in reservable criticized those levels still declined billion from  npls saw a modest increase and that simply reflects a small amount of consumer real estate deferrals expiring with the expiration of the cares act turning to the business segments one thing wed ask you just to keep in mind for each of the businesses is  expense includes the seasonal payroll tax expense which has negatively impacted efficiency ratios or profit margins in  also and as usual  of every year includes segment capital level evaluation and youll note we put additional capital against each of the businesses due to their growth and as usual weve tried to include business trends and digital stats for each segment so lets start with consumer banking on slide where you can see the consumer bank earned nearly billion thats up over  as revenue growth more than offset the larger prior period reserve release its probably most easily identified by looking at pretax preprovision earnings which grew yearoveryear revenue grew on nii improvement and expense declined creating operating leverage and the fourth consecutive quarter of operating leverage for our consumer team notable customer activity highlights included our net new checking accounts opened in  which represents our thirteenth consecutive quarter of net new consumer checking account growth now this occurred as we began to implement our previously announced insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes which lowered our service charges about million so during this time we saw accounts grow and we saw expenses decline we also grew investment accounts and we saw those balances grow from  to billion and that included billion of client flows and once again we opened nearly million credit cards in the quarter and grew average active card accounts and saw growth in combined credit and debit spend of our continued investment in digital capabilities drove activity with our customers as we crossed in digital sales this quarter and we continued investment in our financial centers opening another eight in the quarter its also worth noting that small business saw continued growth in loans in deposits and in spending small business card spend was up yearoveryear gives you an idea of how small businesses are reopening for business bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 id also draw your attention to slide in the appendix weve shared this with you previously and it simply highlights the origination strength and quality of our consumer underwriting throughout everything our underwriting standards have remained consistent moving to slide wealth management produced strong results earning billion and that represented yearoveryear growth driven by strong revenue improvement good expense management and low credit costs bank of america continues to deliver wealth management at scale across a full range of our client segments and with the best advisors in the industry according to barrons rankings that coupled with our digital leadership is delivering a modern merrill and a modern private bank for clients with enterprise relationships and our clients and advisors have recognized the value in a holistic financial relationship that extends across investments planning and banking and thats what helped drive the billion of clients balance flows that you see here over the past months not only did we see strong investment flows of more than billion but deposits grew billion up and we added billion in loans over the same period marking our 48th consecutive quarter of average loans growth in the business just consistent and sustained performance from the team revenues grew to a new record and were led by growth in nii on the back of those solid deposit and loans increases as well as a improvement in asset management fees expenses increased driven by higher revenuerelated costs and resulted in over basis points of operating leverage and we generated nearly net new households in merrill and more than in the private bank this quarter moving to global banking on slide the business momentum with our commercial clients remains strong in the first quarter the business earned billion in  down million yearoveryear driven by the absence of a large priorperiod reserve release and lower investment banking revenue revenue improvement of yearoveryear reflected higher leasingrelated revenue and nii growth partially offset by those lower investment banking fees net interest income grew on the back of strong loans and deposits growth and the leasing revenue improvement included more esgrelated investments particularly in solar as well as the absence of weather related losses recorded last year while the companys overall investment banking fees of billion declined yearoveryear we gained market share in some important areas and recorded a number three ranking in overall fees and importantly our investment banking pipeline remains quite healthy provision expense reflected a reserve build of million compared to billion release in the yearago period and this quarters provision includes reserves taken for russia exposure and other considerations for loans growth offset by continued improvement in asset quality metrics finally we saw expense decline by driving strong operating leverage switching to global markets on slide and as we usually do i will talk about the segment results excluding dva  net income of billion reflects a solid quarter of sales and trading revenue and it includes a new record for equities the business generated a return in  even with a increase in the capital allocated to the business our investments in this business saw good results as our financing clients continue to increase their activities with our company focusing on yearoveryear sales and trading contributed billion to revenue versus  that was a improvement a little higher than typical seasonality and versus  we saw a decline of as the prior year included higher commodities results due to weatherrelated events ficc declined while equities bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 improved that ficc decline reflects the higher prior period commodities and a weaker credit trading environment and it was partially offset by improved performance across our macro products especially rates and foreign exchange the strength in equities was driven by strong performance in derivatives and yearoveryear expense declined reflecting the absence of costs associated with the realignment of a liquidating business activity to the all other unit as well as some  accelerated cost for incentive changes absent those impacts expenses were up modestly finally on slide we show all other which reported a loss of million declining million from the year ago period revenue declined as a result of higher volume of deals particularly solar and therefore higher partnership losses on esg investments and this is partially offset by the tax impact in this reporting unit expense increased as a result of costs now recorded here in this segment following the  realignment of that liquidating business out of global markets and as a reminder for the financial statement presentation in this release the business segments are all taxed on a standard fully taxable equivalent basis so in all other we incorporate the impact of our esg tax credits and any other unusual items for the quarter for the company our effective tax rate was benefiting from esg investment tax credits and excluding the tax credits the tax rate would have been roughly we expect our effective tax rate in to be between to absent any tax law changes or any unusual items and with that lets open it up please for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions well go first to glenn schorr with evercore your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much and forgive me if this is a drop long but listening to all your comments about the consumer about spending about no real stresses in credit net chargeoffs nonperformings debt service levels all that sounds great and in the past i think higher rates were designed to pull leverage from the system and caused some recessions and so the market is trying to assign some percentage chance towards a recession yet every comment i hear out of your mouth doesnt sound like were going towards a recession so i wanted to see if i could a get you to comment on your thoughts around todays environment versus history and then also specifically ask what you did with the ins and outs in reserves and if youve changed any macro scenarios as you bake in cecl reserves thanks for that and thanks for bearing with me alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp thanks glenn so youre right to pick up on the commentary because brian is highlighting the strength of the consumer which remains extraordinary and at the same time what we see on the asset quality side of commercial is just continued steady improvement as the economy reopens so thats what were seeing thats contemporaneous bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 now youre asking a question about what does it look like in the future and were obviously aware of what the fed is trying to engineer so going through this every quarter as we always do we have an opportunity to think about how we look at our reserves and this quarter we took some of the upside out weve got a little more weightings towards a baseline a little more towards downside so thats one thing weve done second thing weve done is weve upped our forecast for inflation so we see that flowing through and those scenarios are a little more weighted towards inflationary and third we have adjusted gdp growth down largely based on blue chip consensus so we like you are looking at two things number one were looking at what were seeing in the actual results and number two were thinking about how we balance that going forward with our scenarios brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp glenn i think just generally the fed has a task to bringing inflation out of the system and our gdp assumptions by candace browningplatt and her team are for the economy to slow its growth rate from this year to the next year the question of great debate is a soft landing hard landing et cetera but i think whats unusual this time is how much cash is sitting in the consumers accounts if you and i are sitting here when they start normalizing rates in the middle of the last decade late to middle last decade you wouldnt have seen the consumer balances sitting with those multiples i gave you earlier in their accounts and then having tremendous borrowing capacity left in terms of unused credit lines and same on the commercial side lines are bouncing along just above the low point and so we continue to adjust our reserve levels to as alastair said to factor in our base case includes higher inflation through the rest of the year and to next year our ph seats reserves set by that base case which is a weighting to adverse frankly equal maybe of the actual reserves we have because the rest are judgmental and ph imprecision and things like that so were very strongly reserved and were very mindful of that i think its very different to think about the situation where the consumers the unemployment is already so low and the consumers are sitting on money and i think that puts more tension on the fed to architect a successful change and they know that but on the other hand its a better place to start glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate all that one little tiny followup is in global banking i noticed billion more allocated capital deal activity is down but you mentioned pipelines are good so maybe you could just talk about just whats going on there thank you alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well we dont have a great deal to add there obviously were coming off of record quarters last year and were just operating in the market conditions that were given the volatility has obviously been hardest felt in equity capital markets and in high yield and across the board wed say our pipelines look very strong so i think when i asked matthew he said somewhere between strong and very strong so that should tell you everything you need to know but obviously we need market conditions to cooperate glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 perfect thanks so much operator our next question comes from john mcdonald with autonomous research your line is open john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about expenses and operating leverage are you still thinking that expenses will be flattish this year in the billion ballpark brian and you did mention expectations for the efficiency ratio as your operating leverage improves with nii maybe that marches down from kind of the mid to low i think you said brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah and alastair gave you some detail but just simply put john we expect it to be relatively flat for versus thats the guide we gave you last quarter and we dont see anything different this quarter john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thats helpful and then alastair maybe just a little more fleshing out about the capital and how youre managing the cet1 obviously youre generating already capital each quarter above what youre paying out the dividend it seemed like basis points this quarter and that probably gets better at the same time it sounds like youre maybe going to manage up to around over the next year maybe you can just give us some of the dynamics there and how that plays into the ability to do some buybacks through the rest of the year thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so no change to our approach john relative to prior years i think the waterfall that we laid out in slide is pretty constructive first priority for us will remain just invest in growth well support our clients and let them get after the teams get after the loans to help our clients there second will be well make the dividend payments and then well have capital left over for share buyback as we have had in the past and well make those decisions in the context of future rate environments and future capital requirements i think brian pointed out to you that were going to build capital over the course of the next couple years by about basis points weve got seven quarters so its a small amount every quarter that well be doing brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp and john you said operating leverage im proud of the team we have three straight quarters of operating leverage ppnr growth was strong thats different than what weve seen out there generally but remember during as the rates rose in the prepandemic setting and glenns question about soft landing hard landing inherently weighs on everybodys mind the simple fact is we had straight quarters of operating leverage and were starting to see that come through and if you look at the consumer efficiency from the first quarter last year to this quarter ph you pointed to the efficiency ratio this has all come through nii and all falls to the bottom line and therefore you end up with a fairly significant impact to those businesses which are obviously ph highly sensitive to growth in nii bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it thats helpful thanks very much operator our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi brian and alastair i wondered if you can ask just make a distinction between the economic regulatory and accounting outlook so from the economic standpoint youre marking to market your assets and your securities and you saw a swing to aoci but you dont marktomarket that billion of deposits from a regulatory standpoint aoci causes you to slow buybacks i believe you said but from an accounting or earnings standpoint maybe you win in the end maybe you dont so i know youre not giving specific guidance for nii but just at a basic level is your guys earnings outlook better because of the nii and the higher payment rates and the better efficiency or is it worse because you have less buybacks maybe more provisions due to the potential for a recession brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp mike those are all the pieces but simply put i think alastair said nii pick up next quarter so you pick up the million this quarter you put that in the bank then you pick up another millionplus next quarter and then it grows from there out so yes thats tremendous operating leverage and as we just said to john the expenses are flat so that flows through the bottom line all the different vagaries of not only regulatory accounting versus gaap accounting but also what ph counts in the capital ratio calculations versus not at the end of the day you said trillion trillion of deposits trillion just on the for people side of the business and even on the business side we only have operational deposits and so at the end of the day those are very long deposits we extract the value through investing and thats why we put it in heldtomaturity and the cash flow off that heldtomaturity portfolio is odd billion a quarter even when the rate environment changes so whatever hit we had to cet1 the growth in nii and the growth in earnings power covers up this side of the year and so we feel very good about that so a rate environment where we come off the zero floors makes us a lot more money you know that and we know that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc can you elaborate a little bit more on what you mean by operational deposits i know youve talked about that and the linkages and i guess thats the reason why you would expect deposits to be more sticky but can you elaborate a little bit more you mentioned that zelle and erica volumes were up four times higher than pre pandemic so i guess you have a little bit more lockin but if you can just elaborate more brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 on the consumer side you have people meaning wealth management consumers and general consumers of the trillion were or more in checking accounts and thats the money people have in motion in a given day and what the big volume ph moats comes from frankly million checking holders which is a new record for us and so thats important and all the feature functionality helps our retention for our preferred customer base in the consumer segment which represents or of all deposits is 99pointsomething and so those customers stay with us a long time what i meant operational accounts on the commercial side all the cash is money in motion for those commercial customers meaning its part of their daily cash flow so whether its small business customers whether its business banking customers which are under million revenue companies or even middle market this money is coming in and out every day and so its very stable it doesnt disappear from the scenes and if you look at our gts revenue you can see the global transaction services revenue on the page on global banking youll see its grown nicely yearoveryear and thats due to the stability of that deposit base and what we see so its not going to move away from the balance sheet thats the point i said about in a rate rising cycle last rate rising cycle as money supply shrank at the end of the day we grew deposits and so well see what happens because its different but we feel pretty confident mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp mike the only other thing id add is when brian talks about operating its one of the reasons we highlight that of our consumer accounts are primary and weve had 99plus retention rate on those accounts so these are sticky deposits thats what were just trying to make sure that everyone understands mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator well go next to betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey thanks good morning two questions one on expenses i know you mentioned this year that youre still anticipating relatively flat and that youd deal with inflation pressures et cetera from some of the opportunities you have to get more efficient can you give us a sense as to how long you think you can stay flat for like is that going to be into as well and can you unpack some of the things youre doing to get more efficient i know you did a ton of efficiency precovid so whats left thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so betsy remember coming into the pandemic we had hit the point where we brought expenses down and said now were an operating leverage company so well get revenue growth faster than expense growth but wed start bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 to grow modestly then the pandemic had a lot of expenses coming in and out and so when we say flat year overyear basically meaning versus in that billion to billion range our view is that our goal is to keep that down to a modest expense growth if any and as we move to et cetera but we are fighting all those discussion you had but the key is to have the revenue grow much faster and thats what we expect to see as nii kicks back up and the efficiency ratios as mike or john referenced ought to kick back down pretty nicely betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then the other question is just further rate backups obviously year is already at its up bps from march so if it goes to like we get the same kind of hit as this past quarter can you just give us a sense as to how youre dealing with that rate backup is there anything you would do differently would you move any afs to htm or would you engage this new accounting rule thats been finalized in march that enables you to do last layer hedging on htm book i mean does any of that matter to you and just give us a sense as to how much longer this rate backup is or would you change how youre dealing with it thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so the piece that will matter the most will be the afs securities and weve talked before about the fact that we have about billion of treasuries there and theyre all swapped theyre all swapped to floating precisely to insulate us so i think thats one of the reasons you see our aoci hit is much smaller than many others betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so then its just a question of managing around the billion or so of securities that we have there that arent swapped to floating and i just note that that number has come down a little bit month after month after month i think it will keep coming down we have some ability obviously to hedge that if we choose to and so well manage our interest rate exposure as the environment develops from here betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks operator well go now to matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi i was hoping to get a little more detail on the net interest income trajectory in the back half of the year if we follow the forward curve and i appreciate you dont want to give explicit guidance because maybe a month from now the rate environment will change but its also the key driver for bank of americas earnings from here and obviously a very positive story so just want to dig in and maybe ill start it with next quarter is up more than bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 million if you follow the forward curve it seems like that quarteronquarter increase could actually accelerate in the back half of the year so maybe ill indiscernible alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so look i think we broadly speaking agree with you we obviously dont control rates so thats why were always reluctant to give guidance over the course of the next days but were very levered to rates going up from here and we said in our remarks that we believe this second quarter well be up at least million in nii and i think if you look at the forward curve yes we would expect to accelerate over the course of the year and then we tried to give you the broad outlines around billion versus forward billion versus spot its obviously very meaningful but were only prepared to look at over the course of the next days because we feel like weve got pretty good confidence around that and i think the other thing just to bear in mind is our next meeting is may so youll see like the fed meetings and the hikes in the forward curve really do accelerate things in the back half of the year matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and how do you think if we do get kind of the second basis point rate increase that the market is anticipating what does that look like in terms of your rate sensitivity and then just kind of squeezing similar at some point do rate hikes not help net interest income or it helps but just to a lesser extent thank you alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i think just the fact that youve got billion compared to billion tells you a little about successive rate hikes become less valuable but were probably a long way from where they stop having value so look wed expect as brian talked about were kind of at a rate floor when rates are at zero and obviously well get significant benefit over the course of the next basis points i like you would anticipate less from the following basis points but again were going to capture a lot of value because our strategy is based around operating accounts in commercial and primary accounts in consumer brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah the question always is if the fed is hiking rates because of inflation that they cant get back under control you got to look at the stuff thats everybody focuses on nii but you got to look at whats going on in the economy generally so thats why we have significant reserves in case its a harder landing than people at the fed would like to engineer and thats why weve run the company with such balance but generally a higher sustained rate environment will help us earn a lot more money and you saw that pick up as we picked up through and youll see it happen again youve already seen it happen just think last year first quarter and this year first quarter we have billion more nii per quarter so thats already helped and as loan and deposit growths are matched with some modest rate increases matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you very much operator our next question comes from erika najarian with ubs your line is open bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning my first question is a followup to what matt was asking about alastair could you give us a sense of what the deposit repricing assumption is in the plus billion in sensitivity for the first basis points and given your focus on primary and operating accounts contrast that with chunkier rate hikes how should we expect deposit repricing to behave in the second basis points alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so we normally take a look at our deposit betas over the course of history and if you go back to the last rate hike cycle through on average you cant its obviously very different by account and line of business and client but on average it was somewhere between and for bank of america wed hope to perform a little better in this cycle just based on the value we deliver to clients particularly in things like digital et cetera but for now i think thats a reasonable assumption its difficult to project out first basis points versus second basis points i would imagine for the first couple of hundred its going to be pretty i would hope pretty stable but at some point when we think deposit betas we drift higher well obviously be able to give you guidance on that in the future based on what were actually seeing erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and i just wanted to clarify something brian that you said to betsy did you say that you expect expenses to be between billion and billion and then for modest growth to return in brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp no we said is flat to and then erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp to grow modestly then erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay got it and then the followup question there is you mentioned your trajectory your target for getting back to on the efficiency ratio what kind of timeframe are you thinking in terms of when you can accomplish that relative to the forward curve brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think that if we make progress each quarter basically ph but were on to were down yearover year i think if i gave you the specific quarter indiscernible basically give you an earnings projection for the rest of the quarter so erika i think just as you look at the businesses youre starting to see them drop bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 more in line obviously we always have such a huge wealth management business which at pretax margin which is industryleading moves up to last quarter ph will impact in fact its a bigger part of our business than others but youll see relentless progress but i cant give you the exact quarter erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just one last question on capital so today your current cet1 minimum is and the higher g sib surcharge when is that is that effective by january so therefore your minimum goes up by basis points and brian what how are you thinking of buffers relative to your new minimums i think one of your counterparts said that he was no longer thinking of buffers upon buffers as he thinks of capital management going forward alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so erika our gsib minimum would increase effective january so weve got seven quarters to build towards that brian talked about operating and managing the company to basis points above our regulatory minimum thats obviously exactly where we are right now and so over the course of the next seven quarters we just expect to build that basis points of capital erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you operator well go now to ken usdin with jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning just wanted to look at the commercial side of loans fourth quarter loan growth ex ppp was great at and this quarter a little slower just wanted to ask you about just that end demand question any supply chain any interchanges in line utilization and just what are you seeing out there on the commercial demand side thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well our clients are definitely seeing supply chain challenges theyre working through it admirably theyre also seeing inflation and theyre seeing labor and wage pressure so that i think we all know at the same time the economy is returning more towards normal and our line utilization is returning more towards normal too thats a part of whats driving our loans growth so revolver utilization in commercial now in banking is pre pandemic our normal was around so thats another i figure thats like billion to billion of loans potential as the economy continues to heal and as clients begin to take utilization back so its one of the reasons were still comfortable with loans growth and we see the same momentum that we have over the course of the past months brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 ph importantly in the small business area originations are strong and back past prepandemic levels of quarterly originations and youre seeing home equity come back up even though mortgage will fall off i think prepandemic we did billion so we have room on the consumer side and on the commercial side for further loan growth as people sort of normalize their behaviors and activities and you all read about the car industry the line uses at car companies car auto dealers was real low and just as an example they cant keep enough inventory on the line ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah and one followup on the fee side i know investment banking and trading are going to be hard to forecast but just any thoughts on some of the consumerrelated and brokeragerelated fee areas theres been some underlying moving parts there just can you talk about just the growth trajectory of some of those fee areas and i guess well kind of leave the ib trading to well see what happens in the markets alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah well i think were wise to do that when it comes to the card side id say flattish were managing to the total client relationship there that remains something where were focused on total value so well see some growth there well see it in balances well see it in nii mostly and well see it in indiscernible elsewhere on the asset management side mostly it will be around market levels so well follow that as you will closely and a little bit of net new household growth and flows growth again this year so thats how were thinking about it but i would say across all kind of flattish slightly maybe slightly up the only one thing to bear in mind is just as a reminder on insufficient funds and overdraft just remember that those that started to kick in in february and the remainder will pass through in march so thats probably like a sorry in may and thats probably a million hit for the year if you like on total fees ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks ph for the reminder thanks alastair operator well go now to steven chubak with wolfe research your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning i wanted to ask a followup on the earlier discussion on the efficiency ratio if we look at what you achieved last cycle your terminal efficiency trajected closer to the upper once the fed funds rate eclipsed basis points i wanted to get a sense whether theres a credible case for delivering a better than efficiency ratio this cycle are there structural factors supporting a higher terminal efficiency in this coming cycle brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp steven the dynamics could be how big the wealth management business sits as a percentage of the total and just the dynamics of that business and thats always what constrained ph the fee in the rest of businesses if i remember right peak cycle both global banking went well below consumer went well below and then between markets and wealth management now wealth management has done a great bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 job of growing its loans and deposits so that will help but thats always going to be the debate and you should be cheering for strong wealth management revenues even if it means a little less efficiency ratio steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc well ill certainly be cheering for that brian maybe just for my followup on capital i know we spent a lot of time talking about aoci volatility and the like what i was hoping to get a better sense of given that rwa growth has actually been the biggest source of capital consumption over the last couple of quarters its up about yearon year just given the pace of continued strong loan growth thats anticipated what level of organic rwa growth should we be underwriting as we think about the capital algorithm going forward alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i think what youre looking to is some of the rwa growth has been coming from a pretty significant loans rebound particularly in commercial and i think youre looking at some of the investments weve made in our global markets business some of thats a little seasonal so it pops up in  and some of it is yearoveryear so going forward i think our growth well have plenty of capital to support the growth that we expect in terms of rwas we manage that pretty closely again the economy is beginning to return now to something more normal after bouncing around a bit a bunch so this quarter when you think about those riskweighted assets basis points brians talked about a third a third a third for share repurchase dividend and growth thats probably a fair starting point steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my questions a couple what are you i heard the commentary about deposit balances brian from you that theyre still very high in the lower end customers however if we start to get a little more granular very recently are you starting to see any drawdown with higher spending because of inflation or any color on that i know quarteroverquarter they are but as we start to look forward to see how things are progressing are we seeing that yet brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp its actually the opposite of that they grew faster from february to march and thats partly because of tax returns vivek ph that they have basically the broad way to think about it is beginning around may of last year they grew sort of not annualized but per month pretty consistently to higher at the lower end balances only in the month of november i think we saw a slight downdraft in the lower end balances and that picked back up in december grew january february march each month it grew this quarter and the march month was the strongest so we might we havent seen the data for april yet but its growing very strong all the way up into the people who carried prepandemic to in balances are still growing and fairly strongly so were not seeing that deteriorate at all yet bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and a completely different question for you folks securities growth didnt see that this quarter even if you x out the marktomarket stuff whats your plan for that are you planning to grow securities balances should we be or what are you thinking at this point brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp it all comes down to deposits if we keep growing deposits we got to put them to work so alastair can give you more detail you got to remember that what drives the size of our balance sheet is our righthand side not our left and so a trillion we grew billion billion of deposits last year first quarter to this year first quarter so if we grow deposits which you should be cheering for on the core basis we do we will then invest those deposits in a careful way alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp and vivek if you look at this quarter we added billion of deposits we added billion of loans thats always going to be our first choice in terms of investment the securities balances came down a little bit billion and remember if you go back over the course of the past couple of years in the pandemic we didnt see the loans growth so in many ways thats why we purchased some securities it was to replace loans that were coming off but thats not what were seeing now now were seeing loans growth so our first use will always be for loans and if we keep seeing the same kind of loans growth were seeing right now the securities may decline over time and they stay flat well see it depends on deposits vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and how about in terms of liquid assets what level should we expect you would bring that down to because those have come down a little bit when you look at them quarteroverquarter and theyre also down some year overyear is there room for that to come down further whats sort of a run rate for that assuming lets assume deposits were flat and didnt go down didnt grow much grew modestly where can that be drawn down to alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so liquidity is down in the quarter thats largely based on funding the global markets business with seasonal if you look yearoveryear at our liquidity numbers youll see our global liquidity sources at billion theyre up like a scooch from  of last year hqla surplus is up thats largely based on things like again brian talks about our deposits at trillion we have were probably more liquid now than weve ever been and weve got plenty i think as we continue to grow deposits in the future id hope our liquidity just continues to stay where it is or go higher vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator and well take a followup from mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i was a little disappointed about the question related to terminal efficiency i get if you ph weight adjust wealth management but with all the technology investments shouldnt your incremental pretax margins be greater on your new revenues and if so shouldnt your terminal efficiency business mix adjusted be better than it was before for example specifically your pretax margin in was where should your pretax margins be on new revenues that are generated ph by that brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp the new revenues will generate more margin profit mike and the efficiency ratio lets always see where we get to but itll keep coming down and we are improving every all the way through until the pandemic and with operating leverage every quarter and i think it ph now going back and checking it quarter by quarter i think it improved every quarter leaving aside some seasonality but we will keep driving it down headcount this quarter was down another people it was down last year we are adding salespeople were opening new branches were investing in the franchise weve opened in markets and we have billion of new deposits in those branches to give you a sense and theres only branches you know our strategy mike so its always going to come down to balancing all that but at the end of the day were saying expenses are flat this year and the nii improvement is going to flow to the bottom line thats a pretty strong impact to efficiency especially because its going through the businesses even the wealth management business mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then one another followup i dont think theres a recession this year but ive been wrong before and the stock market is telling us there might be a pretty good chance of a recession so brian and alastair what do you think the chance of a recession is in you have a lot more people data businesses insight into the us economy and you need to have a percentage for that for your provision for loan losses so is this chance chance what do you think brian kind of gut feel and alastair by the numbers brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think youre a good critic and observer of banks mike but the reality is we have economists predict recessions and all the adages about them and the reality is they always have a prediction for recession that runs around according to economists that talk to me but let me flip to what you really said which is we weighted the adverse scenario factor ph about factor in our baseline reservesetting that produces a formulaic reserve which is around of our total reserves and so we have reserves on top of that that brace us for tough times so im not going to chatterbox with you about soft landing hard landing and all that stuff but the reality is theyve got to take the inflation out of the system they know that theyre raising rates to do that but theres tension against how easy or hard thats going to be obviously pandemic war but also this issue that the massive amount of stimulus is still out there being spent so were braced for every scenario we model every scenario but i dont put a specific percentage i just thats somebody elses job to do that but our economists do not have a recession predicted in terms of this year around growth next year a little low at and even though there may be some quarters that are going to show modest growth i think they were all positive if i got it right bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc understood thank you operator our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi brian hi alastair brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp gerard how are you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good thanks alastair you guys are very wellpositioned as you pointed out through your balance sheet for rising interest rates which seemed very very likely this year obviously and obviously you guys are not a pt boat but a battleship to turn the balance sheet into a position and when the fed finally succeeds lets say in hitting inflation knocking it down they stop raising rates maybe even have to cut rates to get the economy going when do you guys start thinking about after the fed succeeds at reducing inflation that you may have to reposition the balance sheet and not be as asset sensitive brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp we dont well gerard just to start we you remember indiscernible you know this as well as anybody having been around this industry for a number of years lets just say at the end of the day the reason why we have securities investments is because we have trillion of deposits and trillion dollars of loans and so we got to do something with the money and the deposits are stable the core checking accounts the core operating accounts for commercial customers so we put it to work to extract the value for the shareholders and so its not that we lean the balance sheet its as we do all the work we do in the core franchise to grow the number of customers or since prepandemic in core consumer checking customers to grow the commercial customer base small business base et cetera that results in us having a balance sheet that is positioned to benefit from the rising rates because we have so much zero cost deposits and so we dont sit there and say lets move the balance sheet what we do is we try to protect in a cautious way ph all the risk so we hedged a couple a year or so yearandahalf ago there were a lot of questions about oh my gosh youre investing and rates are low and we told people we hedged it and now youre seeing the benefits of those hedges that gave ph up nii from then till now to protect the capital and thats what we did so were always trying to manage extracting the value of deposits and then look to the other side and see the capital constraint question and the impact to capital to see other constraints on us but its really and we only invest in treasuries and mortgagebacked securities we dont take any more credit risk in the treasury book for lack of a better term because we take enough ph in the company bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 so i just dont we dont sit there and say lets move around its just how do we invest this and we may move a little shorter or longer in what we invest in but frankly weve swapped a lot of it to short just to protect ourselves so that wed be able to redeploy at higher rates in the future gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup on the gsib buffer that you guys pointed out that will take effect i think you said in the basis point increase is there any strategies you can employ that could actually reduce that buffer before we get there or is it really just retaining more earnings from your balance from your daytoday operations brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think were growing through it because it has the way thats calculated that are not sensitive to our size relative to the economy stock price all these kinds of things in it that move it around a little bit but the reality is that it wouldnt when we look at the core customer base we wouldnt constrain core customer growth we can always make efficiencies and move stuff around and we saw believe it or not as you can see in the other category have loans which ph in that quarter our franchise still left over frankly from years ago whenever the heck it was that we can let run off and stuff like that or sell off and stuff but the reality is is that the gsib buffer is growing because our customer franchise is getting bigger and the method of calculation does not adjust for business success size of the economy stock market cap increase all those things which i think youre in pretty good favor of gerard so were going to have to retain basis points more capital so divide that basis points by quarters and think about us pulling that through the question of buffers to that number you should expect us to operate close to that i guess because frankly the number is getting so big that we never had an issue of the size of capital implied by that buffer to the minimum regulatory minimum gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc indiscernible brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp indiscernible the franchise generated return on tangible common equity this quarter and will continue to go up and continue to be strong based on the nii improvement gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you appreciate it operator well take our final question from chris kotowski with oppenheimer your line is open chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022 yeah good morning thank you recognizing that the heldtomaturity portfolio doesnt get marked to market i would think though on an kind of underlying core economic basis its never fun to have a large bond portfolio thats under water and just looking at your yearend disclosures it looks like the vast majority of that heldto maturity portfolio is agencies with a more than 10year maturity and i guess how do you look at the extension risk on that portfolio again recognizing its not marked but economically is there any way to protect yourself in kind of a tail environment where rates go up a couple hundred basis points like they did in ph or alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp okay so let me address that one i think brians earlier answer got to the first part of it which is were not interest rate traders were interest rate managers through the cycle we got to deliver for our shareholders in low rate environments and we have to deliver for them in high rate environments those mortgages protected us in a low rate environment and now what protects us in a rising rate environment is precisely the asset sensitivity we still have left in the company and so when you look at that billion of growth and now were telling you you should expect nii growth from here successively in each quarter thats what protects us its that balance between capital earnings and liquidity brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp its just the cash flow of the portfolio even in a very low prepayment rate scenario you got to remember you have people pay you principal and interest people pass away and then people move irrespective of mortgage rates refinancing and those numbers all that cash can be redeployed at the higher rate structure so it turns a little faster than people think because ph everybody takes it to zero as your prepayments that the cash flow off of it is fairly significant so well redeploy that and walk back up the ladder but and also remember economically if we dont mark our deposits its one of the great debates weve all had in proper accounting for banks but at the end of the day the deposits are growing economically at a much faster rate than the degradation on the mortgagebacked securities portfolio chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay all righty thank you brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp all right i think thats all our questions thank you for joining us again this quarter it was a strong quarter by the team and i want to thank the team for all the great work theyve done at the end of the day as we told you last quarter and a few quarters before that the organic growth machine at bank of america is driving hard growing its market share growing its deposits growing its loans and doing well in the market we will accelerate the pl from that growth with higher rates as we told you well continue to hold expenses in check driving operating leverage and that will always be a focus to get the most efficient growth we can the strong customer activity which we spoke about continues even in the first part of april here and so that would end up driving is good for our company and will drive earnings so thank you we look forward to talking to you next time bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2022
