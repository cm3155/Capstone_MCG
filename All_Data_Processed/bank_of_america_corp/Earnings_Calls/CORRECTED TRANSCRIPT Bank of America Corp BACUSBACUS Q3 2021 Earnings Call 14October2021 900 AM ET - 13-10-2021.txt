morning to all and thank you for joining us this quarter the economy continued to make solid progress and our clients continued to perform well having adjusted to the operating environment many companies are making healthy profits and our research team expects another strong quarter of profits by american businesses we reported billion in net income or per diluted share in the third quarter up significantly from the yearago period weve now earned over billion through the first nine months of the year this quarter strong results include some themes that i want to highlight ahead of paul going through the details on the quarter so prior to the pandemic bank of america was growing and creating operating leverage quarter after quarter after quarter as i said last quarter the prepandemic organic growth machine has kicked back in you see that this quarter and is evident across all our lines of business in addition this quarter we saw the return of operating leverage we also saw another quarter of solid loan growth the good news is that the nature of this growth has broadened in the third quarter indiscernible even as commercial banking utilization rates have improved somewhat niis improved significantly reflecting the many quarters of growth in deposits and now loans it also reflects a steady management of the interest rate risk and deployment of cash from our core deposit growth at the same time we still have a high level of asset sensitivity we invested in our core deposits and had supported stability in nii over the last year as rates in loans declined what that did is bridge us to where we are now this quarter where growth in loans and other factors have led to an improvement in nii and in nim strong fee growth has complemented that nii improvement and with the expenses moving sharply lower we saw a notable return of operating leverage yearoveryear our revenue is up and expenses were flat our efficiency ratios improved to as ive done in the past i wanted to spend a moment on what we see in our consumer data let me hit a few slides beginning first on slide the improvement in the vaccination and hospitalizations all the things you know about have seen the us economy continue its reopening trajectory following the modest slowdowns in the surging cases caused by the delta variant while theres been some discussion around the slowdown i would just note that the us economy is now as large as it was in prepandemic our own research team not being intransigent at all expects the us economy to grow plus this year and next year these growth rates are more than twice the growth rates that occurred in the prepandemic decade or longer unemployment rates continue to fall back to prepandemic levels while the us still has issues around labor supply and supply chains of materials the economy is moving along looking at our own customer base and consumer spending id offer you a few insights third quarter total bank of america consumer spending you can see in the lower lefthand part of the slide payments were robust they bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 reached billion up over for the quarter and a similar percent of growth over september was the best month of the year and weve seen that spending rates continue through the first part of october combined spend on debit and credit cards which is a subset of this total about 20odd percent of it in that retailers and services remained strong in third quarter we continue to see spending shift toward travel and inperson entertainment as well as fuel driven by both increased use and higher fuel prices yeartodate you can see in the chart a total payments of trillion by our consumers are ahead of the levels in the chart on the right you can see how fast the growth rates occurred this year and thats another economic signpost of the steady recovery now as we turn to loan growth on slide you can see this chart that weve been presenting to you for last several quarters why do we show you this we wanted to show you that as we hit the bottom in the inflection point and what happened a couple of quarters ago and this chart gives you a sense of the daily progression across those quarters as you can see every loan category has seen improvement and if i showed you this by our lines of business you would see similar progress across each one of them overall pending loans excluding ppp loans which are in the forgiveness process as you well know overall those loans increased billion linked quarter and if you look at the commercial portfolio they grew billion quarteroverquarter compared to growth in  growth this quarter was broadbased across global banking and global markets in the commercial space ci growth was driven in part by improved calling efforts from commercial relationship managers that we deployed across the world including in addition to a growing demand for credit as you might note weve invested in hundreds of relationship managers in our commercial lines of business and theyre now those investments are now bearing fruit loans with our wealth management clients continue to grow this quarter as these customers borrow for the reasons they borrow for liquidity and asset purchases and other things interesting in our small business area were seeing the business stabilize and start to grow one of the areas is our practice solutions group what that group does is lends to medical dental and veterinary practices they continue to see momentum and are on the pace for the best year theyve ever had now turning to consumer loans the american consumer continues to borrow from bank of america card loans grew annualized from quarter two levels with increased spending and that as you well know prepayment rates trends remain high all products in the consumer side except to home equity balances had higher balances for the quarter the decline in home equity balance is understandable given the prepayments in mortgage loans et cetera but still we saw billion in originations this quarter up more than from last years third quarter now turn your attention to a slide in the appendix not to cover it now but you should take a look there and youll see the true loan lending business on the bottom lefthand side of that slide and youll see without the volatile ppp in and out thats occurred there because the program design the loans this year in those lines of business are basically within of where they were last year and we can grow out from here moving to slide we want to show they continued reemerged the prepandemic growth machine of bank of america we give you a few highlights on the deposit side we grew net consumer checking accounts which is the primary transaction account for our consumers being primary for the 11th consecutive quarter this drove the continued growth in deposits and our leadership position in us retail deposit market share reaching trillion of deposits in our consumer segment alone bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 our credit cards we crossed back over million new card production thats the same level as we were pre pandemic new investment accounts have increased during the pandemic digital progress has occurred across every business and youll see that in pauls slides later and thats increased sales of products and high use of digital platforms this bodes well for future sales levels and for future efficiency sales of banking products in merrill lynch and the private bank have remained strong and with return to inperson meetings we should even see them grow stronger we have seen yeartodate assets under management flows grow and it nearly tripled compared to yeartodate in markets and banking we had record or near record quarters at both investment banking and equity trading revenue so these are just a few examples of the customer growth we are seeing a point or two on capital this quarters level of profits coupled with our excess capital allowed us not only to pay higher dividends to shareholders but also to buy back billion in shares in total we returned billion to you our shareholders through these actions proving that we can support our customers in a growing economy support our teammates with great pay and benefits and support our communities as ill describe in a minute but above all and return capital to you our shareholders and drive good returns for you going to slide with regard to how our teams are delivering more broadly in our communities we gave you on slide an update on our billion commitment to date we have directly funded nearly million about onethird of that commitment this includes million completed in equity investments in mdis and cdfis million in equity investment commitments to minorityfocused funds to support minority and women entrepreneurs and businesses and million are directed at philanthropic giving directed at the priorities shown on the slide in addition to the amount we usually give on a yearly basis now its worth noting that in addition to these equity investments we have billion in deposits in cdfis and mdis the largest in the us doing that if you go to the next slide slide this is what were doing with our customers to help live with their financial lives even better it highlights the products and services starting in the financial wellbeing of our retail clients particularly in the lowtomoderate income areas we serve this includes our commitment to our pathways program where we hire teammates from our local communities to serve our communities and then be successful in our company as the company of opportunity for them weve recently ph reupped to hire another teammates from our communities over the next five years thats because we completed the first a year early the unified ways in which our teammates in local markets to a spectacular job of approaching both banking from a global scale and both banking from a local community is unique and delivers every day for us its been a great job by our team this quarter and i want to thank them now im going to turn it over to paul but as you know paul has been our cfo since and has done a spectacular job with our company hes going off to help us do some interesting things in the company and i just want to congratulate and thank paul for his support and i will turn it over and to take you through his last earning call paul paul m donofrio chief financial officer bank of america corp thanks brian hello everyone i will start on slide by adding a couple of comments on revenue and returns on a yearoveryear basis revenue rose the improvement was driven by a nearly billion increase in nii and bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 a nearly billion increase in noninterest income by the way every business segment produced yearover year improvement in noninterest income expenses declined from  and were flat with  despite the yearoveryear improvement in revenue and related costs solid revenue growth while holding expenses flat created basis points of operating leverage and resulted in billion of pretax preprovision income up yearoveryear with respect to returns our return on tangible common equity was and roa was basis points both of which improved nicely from the yearago period moving to slide the balance sheet expanded modestly versus  to a little more than trillion after funding billion of loan growth deposit growth of billion generated excess liquidity that was placed in a mixture of securities and cash our liquidity portfolio grew to trillion or onethird of the balance sheet shareholders equity declined billion from  as capital distributions outpaced earnings this quarter with respect to regulatory ratios cet1 under standardized approach was basis points lower than  driven primarily by a reduction in excess capital through share repurchases and to a lesser degree higher rwa as a result of commercial lending growth the ratio was basis points above our minimum requirement of which translates into a billion capital cushion given our deposit growth our supplementary leverage ratio declined to versus a minimum requirement of which leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth our tlac ratio remained comfortably above our requirements turning to slide i will focus on average loan balances because they are more closely linked to nii note that loan growth over the past two quarters has begun to show signs of improved demand and i will refer to quarter overquarter improvement on an annualized basis also note that these charge include ppp loans which have been moving lower driven by forgiveness the footnotes detail the change in ppp loans from a peak of billion last year ppp loans have declined through forgiveness to a little more than billion on an indiscernible basis focusing on the link quarter change in loans and excluding ppp loans total consumer and commercial loans grew on an annualized basis by with commercial growing and consumer improving gwim continued to benefit from securitybased lending as well as custom lending while mortgage continued to perform solidly in global markets we again looked for investment grade opportunities with clients as a good use of liquidity in global banking we saw utilization move past stabilization this quarter but utilization rates are still basis points lower than representing a billion gap from current loan levels in consumer we saw credit card grow as new accounts continued to build across the quarters and credit spending continued to rebound and importantly in mortgage as brian noted we saw growth as prepayment volumes slowed with respect to deposits on slide we continued to see significant growth across the client base adding accounts across all the deposittaking businesses combining both consumer and wealth management customer balances i would highlight that retail deposits grew billion from  these deposits these clients now entrust us to manage more than trillion in deposits which is more retail deposits than any other us bank we also saw a strong growth of billion with our commercial clients and remember the deposits we are focused on and gathering are the operational deposits of our customers in both consumer and wholesale bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 turning to slide and net interest income on a gaap nonfte basis nii in  was billion billion on an fte basis net adjusted income increased million from  driven by deposit growth and related investing of liquidity as well as ppp loan activity these drivers were partially offset by lower loan levels nii versus  was up million there were several positive contributors to the quarteroverquarter growth first we had an additional day of interest we also benefited from the continued deployment and growth of liquidity average loan growth also contributed to nii again this quarter and we experienced an acceleration in the forgiveness of ppp loans which improved nii quarteroverquarter by a couple of hundred million last but not least we had lower bond premium amortization expense which declined from billion to a little more than billion with respect to ppp loan forgiveness i would emphasize that this was an acceleration or pull forward of nii into  from future periods and as a side note i would point out that the revenue from the ppp program has helped to defray some of the enormous costs of administrating this assistance program on behalf of the government our net interest yield improved basis points from  to driven by the improvement in nii importantly given continued deposit growth and low interest rates our asset sensitivity to rising rates remained significant highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships as we move to  and assuming no significant interest rate changes we expect benefits from expected loan growth liquidity deployment and lower premium amortization expense to more than offset the expected reduction in ppp revenue i mentioned assuming the forward curve materializes and given  nii growth as well as expectations for  and assuming we see any loan and deposit growth next year we would expect nii and full year to be well above full year turning to slide and expenses  expenses were billion an improvement of more than million versus  higher revenuerelated costs were more than offset by the absence of the prior quarters contribution to our charitable foundation as well as lower costs of unemployment claims processing compared to the year ago period expenses were flat as improvements in net covid costs the absence of elevated litigation in  as well as digitalization benefits and other initiative savings were offset by higher revenuerelated and other costs as we look forward we continue to see investment in technology and people at a high rate across the businesses and we are adding new financial centers in certain growth markets turning to asset quality on slide as ive reported for several quarters the picture is very good here net chargeoffs this quarter fell again to million or basis points of average loans this is the lowest loss rate in years net chargeoffs were lower than  and more than below the same quarter in our credit card loss rate was and several loan product categories were still in recovery position this quarter provision was a million net benefit driven primarily by asset quality improvement as delinquencies and reservable criticized commercial loans continued to move lower we had a reserve release of billion split roughly in commercial and in consumer our allowance as a percentage of loan to leases ended the quarter at which is still well above the level following our day one adoption of cecl especially considering the mix of loans today versus then to the extent bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 the macroeconomic environment and asset quality improves further and remaining uncertainties dissipate we expect our reserve levels could move lower on slide we show the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios the only point i would make here is just to note the continued low level of latestage delinquency loans which drives expectation that card losses could decline yet again in  before leveling off turning to the business segments and starting with consumer on slide before i touch on the financials i want to highlight what a great job this team has done in turning this business around since the pandemic of all our businesses consumer banking was the most heavily impacted by the pandemic which at its worst drove quarterly profits to a very narrow level before rebounding we incurred heavy cost to protect the health of our associates and customers and we added contractors and other resources to support the government and our own customer assistance programs we added billions to credit reserves depressing profits as worries mounted with respect to potential credit losses net interest income declined as interest rates fell quickly and significantly fastforward to this quarter and the segments rebound has accelerated as earnings rebounded to more than billion net chargeoffs are at historic lows and nii has rebounded reflecting not only deposit growth but also the value of their deposits and customer relationships the business alone has now crossed over trillion in deposits up yearoveryear our point here is that years of investing and operating under responsible growth positioned us to not only deliver for everyone during the pandemic but also rebound quickly to organic growth and operating leverage we were never down and we never stopped investing and while this is true of every segment the rebound in our consumer banking earnings is just a great illustration of the resiliency of our business and our people the segment earned billion in  higher yearoveryear as revenue expense and credit cost all showed improvement revenue improved reflecting higher card income on increased purchase volumes and higher service charges due to client activity net checking accounts grew more than yeartodate and of our consumer checking accounts are primary accounts with an average checking account balance of more than expenses moved lower by as a result of a continued reduction in covid costs mitigated by higher costs from minimum wage increases and other operating costs on credit we had a million reserve release this quarter however the more direct indicator of improved asset quality is the decline in net chargeoffs net chargeoffs of million were down yearoveryear and lower quarteroverquarter our credit card net loss rate for the quarter was prepandemic it was over on slide you can see the increase in consumer deposits loans and investments we covered loans and deposit growth earlier with respect to investment balances we reached a new record of billion growing yearoveryear as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering yes balance grew as market values increased but we also saw billion of client flows an important element of this growth has been the growth in the number of accounts over the past year to more than million on slide let me highlight a couple of points regarding the continued improvement in digital engagement as all of you know enrollment is important but usage is key we now have nearly million customers actively using our industryleading digital platform this quarter of households used some part of our digital platform within the past days logging in more than billion times and while erica and zelle usage has been tremendous what i would draw your attention to is the digital sales growth which is up yearoveryear lastly while not bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 reflected on the slide i would just add digital engagement has become foundational to maintaining our customer satisfaction at historic levels turning to wealth management the continued economic reopening client flows and strong market conditions once again led to not only record investment balances and asset management fees but also record levels of loan and deposits all contributing to a record pretax margin in  in fact this is the 46th consecutive quarter of average loan growth in this business both merrill lynch and the private bank contributed to the improvement and are driving digital engagement to deliver products and services to clients you can expect this to continue as we drive towards a modern merrill which is advisorled powered by digital growth in our new households at merrill and at the private bank continued as we continued to build pipelines and moved back towards our prepandemic pace net income of billion improved yearoveryear driven by the strong revenue performance with respect to revenue record aum fees which grew yearoveryear complemented higher nii on the back of solid loan and deposit increases expenses increased in alignment with higher revenue client balances rose to trillion up yearoveryear driven by higher market levels as well as strong flows of billion lets skip to slide to highlight our progress in digitally engaging wealth management clients the clients of this business continued to lead the franchise on digital adoption utilizing not only digital tools to access their investments but also other banking needs like mobile check deposit and lending more and more clients logged in to easily trade check balances and originate loans all through one simplified signon and through leveraging ericabased ai capabilities and through use of webex meetings and secure text messaging we are making it easier and more efficient for clients to do business with us wherever and however they choose this creates additional capacity for our teams to spend more time advising existing and potential clients moving to global banking on slide the segment had very strong performance with nearrecord investment banking fees another solid quarter of deposit growth and an uptick in loan demand strong deposit growth helped to improve nii which complemented the continued strength in investment banking the business earned billion improving billion yearoveryear driven by both higher revenue and lower provision costs provision expense reflected a reserve release compared to builds in the yearago quarter revenue grew and included an improvement in nii while firmwide investment banking fees were up to billion down only modestly from the  record level this ib performance resulted in a number four ranking in overall fees with a pipeline that remained strong we ranked number one in leveraged finance and investmentgrade with strong market share improvement compared to the yearago period we also had record ma results it is worth noting that we continued to see strong momentum in investment banking with our middle market clients as many of you know we have been investing in our investment banking capabilities with middle market clients for a few years now over that time we have executed transactions for nearly firsttime ib clients and we now have investment bankers in cities across the us noninterest expense increased yearoveryear primarily reflecting higher revenuerelated costs and continued investment in the franchise weve already covered much of the balance sheet on slide so lets skip to digital trends on digital investments strategy and tactics are an enterprise effort with learnings in one segment benefiting another that has been particularly true in global banking and as we continue to invest we continue our investments in digital solutions our client adoption and usage continues to grow enhanced banking solutions have helped us capture bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 greater market share as wholesale clients do more with banking partners that are the most stable and secure and have the capabilities to invest in new technology that will provide better data and global integrated solutions switching to global markets on slide results reflect solid sales and trading activity led by our equities business as i usually do i will talk about the segment results excluding dva this quarter net dva was a modest loss but the yearago quarter had a higher million loss global markets produced million in earnings on par with the yearago quarter focusing on yearoveryear revenue was up driven by sales and trading sales and trading contributed billion to total revenue improving yearoveryear ficc declined while equities improved recording one of its strongest performances ever ficc results reflected a flat yield curve and rangebound interest rates for much of the quarter with continued tight credit spreads with interest rates moving late in the quarter we saw an improvement in activity and revenue opportunities the strength in equities was driven by growth in our client financing business as well as a strong trading performance and increased client activity in both cash and derivatives the increase in expense year overyear was driven by increased activity related sales and trading costs on slide we note yeartodate revenue trends across the last few years as you can see while our performance was elevated in during the pandemic remains well above the prepandemic years presented driven by continued elevation of client activity and volatility in the markets as well as investments made to extend more balance sheet to clients finally on slide we show all other which reported a small net loss revenue declined by million year overyear reflecting higher partnership losses on esg investments expense was lower yearoveryear driven by the absent of litigation accruals in the prior period our effective tax rate this quarter was excluding the tax credits driven by our portfolio of esg investments our tax rate would have been roughly we would expect the tax rate in  to be between and absent any taxlaw changes or unusual items and with that we can go to qa bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question today from glenn schorr with evercore your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much lots of detail i love the forwardleaning commentary on nii audio gap bigger than a breadbox sized it on the expense side obviously expenses go up a little bit with all this marketrelated and activityrelated revenue so maybe if we could think about it ex whatever markets are going to do over the next couple of years youve indiscernible great operating leverage but as you still invest so maybe you can give us an idea of what to expect even if its just over the coming years as you invest yet eke out further efficiency gains thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well i think glenn you might take you back a little bit in history to the and when we started seeing the efforts from the bac and the operating excellence kick in and what we said is wed bring the expenses down and then wed expect them to grow you sort of have a inflationary between raises and leave aside that the market is going up as you said and it could drive a moment in time et cetera but if you had sort of sort of embedded and cpi type of increases and in merit and rents and things like that and what we said is through our efficiency when we got to the sort of floor which was in the year the idea was then to manage that to sort of net growth and weve been able to keep working at that with the ppp and with the covidrelated costs and stuff its kind of threw it all around for the last months but youll see that start to emerge come out the other side so the idea would be to grow revenues faster than the economy and grow expenses at a rate of net maybe if the revenue growth is stronger and thats the operating model and you saw that come on quarter after quarter of operating leverage i think for basically three years plus quarters or something like that and the pandemic pushed that around and as we stabilized after the pandemic a couple of quarters ago youre seeing it come back through the systems glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thats great so it sounds like no change and still operating efficiency cool brian while we have you i think there was like a sevenpage press release announcing all the leadership changes its a lot and so i figure while we have audio gap can talk about whats happening how you is this all natural succession next level steppingup type changes maybe to just put the right perspective around it all brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah sure we announced we have some teammates who are retiring ive been ceo this is 48th quarterly earnings conference call so its been a long time and i would rather never have to have senior leaders move but they have a choice in life and when they retire we have to adjust to it but what we try to accomplish if you go back to last summer we put a lot of senior executives on to the management team what has happened now with annes retirement toms retirement and andreas retirement is those executives now are reporting directly bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 to me and thats really the effort so were a younger more diverse three women running the eight lines of business same philosophy how we run the company and now with a group of people who have to years ahead of them and then we have two international colleagues on the management team for the first time in bernie and cathy cathy is needed to help us in the european context as brexit came through its different in that so so shes going to go help us in that and be a great help to us bernie has international does a great job for us but the idea was to elevate people who and also focus on people who are thinking years out as opposed to one or two and retirement so thats really the genesis of it that people retire and we make reactions tom and anne and andrea have been tremendous teammates but the best thing they did for us is develop a bench behind them that is extremely strong that can step into the jobs and frankly will run a lot of the businesses as they over the last few years as they we all spent more time on driving our brand in the market now that things are more ph at the company level glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thank you brian thank you operator our next question comes from matthew oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i was hoping to circle back on the net interest income commentary which was clearly positive overall but i think youve been talking about net interest income to be up billion versus the first quarter level on prior calls and i think the guidance implies maybe similar to even better than that and i was just hoping to get a little bit more of a point in kind of update for in nii paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp sure so relative to  well have less nii from ppp loan forgiveness however we think we should be able to overcome this decline and produce modest growth in nii in  through a combination of loan growth liquidity deployment and modestly lower premium amortization expense matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay which i think does get you i guess so that up billion versus the ph billion paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp modestly it would imply that brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp matt we tend to tell you what we could do and we do it so thats how we run the company so yes bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc understood okay and then secondly on the expense question you talked about to growth long term but as we think about next year you obviously had some kind of covid and i think some onetime costs in the first quarter how would you help frame costs versus thank you paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp so the way i would think about were not going to provide specific guidance but as a quarterly base for just start with our rough estimate of  or  here  should be flattish to potentially modestly lower than  so just start with that as a base and add to that the seasonal higher payroll tax in the first quarter which is roughly million then as brian said add in inflationary costs which weve been as brian said targeting at around but given the war for talent right now maybe want to a little bit more than next year and then lastly adjust that base for any assumption you make around higher or lower revenue expectations in the areas that are closely linked to compensation and exchange fees and if you do that math youre going to come up with i think a pretty good estimate for matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and anything that we can kind of back out in terms of covid or the ppp costs going away as you think about next year paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah look covid theres still a couple of hundred million of net covid in our costs its down modestly from  were seeing some reduction in covids costs but we incurred some new costs as people returned to the office while theres not a lot left it does create i think modest opportunity over the next year or so to get those costs out matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks for all the clarity operator our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi my question relates to tech ph up due the front office and back office but the front office you have the slide number so net new consumer checking accounts up by half over the past two years how much of that is directly or indirectly related to digital banking and then my back office question which we dont really see is what are you doing as it relates to the cloud your relationship with ibm what sort of efficiencies do you think you can get and i think you indicated you dont plan to go to the public cloud like some of your other peers have targeted so if you could elaborate on your tech strategy thanks bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so mike on the first the production of net new checking accounts and you remember mike this is not youve been around us a long time and these are core checking accounts so the primary keeps going up it actually went from to over the last year the primary accounts so the production hit this quarter was i think a year high in terms of net accounts and thats coming both from the digitals of sales round numbers and we now have to your point over the last three years developed full digital execution in terms of account opening for core accounts in terms of auto purchases in terms of mortgage origination et cetera which now allows a fully digital practice to take place half the sales are digital the good news honestly is that as the branches reopened over the last and people the visits went up you saw the accounts so it would rise because it takes both high touch and high tech to be successful so the percentage in sales of digital came down but thats because overall sales jumped up and obviously that more branch dominated but youve got it exactly right we think that is a more efficient method of accumulating customers we think we have about market share in the gen z area that is heavily digitally originated lot of ph colleges lot of other things going on but the key is to realize that net balances per account have gone from to over the last couple of years so youre seeing a bigger and bigger core position when you go with and thats one thing to keep in mind is when you give you our indiscernible digital customers these customers are core customers with big balances so merrill edge for example i think were up to or something average balance per account not or but anyway just on the cloud the cloud is a complex question so as you are well aware over the last years cathy and the team led an effort to internalize our cloud which made us lot more efficient and so we look at we run a percentage of our business outside due to certain executions and things like that we have different software programs that run in a saas the saas basis which is the question of cloud can be misleading as can you get to the all the product types or capability types you can get there because of the new companies that develop them on the cloudbased systems and we can get to them all the idea was an effort to internalize the cloud that we can use as a financial service industry and ibm is working on that but these things have to be done carefully for purposes of security and trust and understanding our businesses and so far weve come to the judgment that were continuing to internalize and saving a lot of money and we continue to add modest amounts to the cloud but importantly theres no restraint on our ability to tap innovation or ingenuity based on whether its running internally or externally paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp next question please operator our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi brian how are you bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp good gerard how are you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good can you guys share with us youve had an incredible deposit growth as you pointed out the retail consumer areas over trillion when the fed ends qe sometime next year can you share with us what you think will happen to deposit growth and second your loan to deposit ratio similar to your peers is very low how do you see growing that over the next two or three years and where can you get it to do you think brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp paul why dont you add a few comments on the change in monetary policy and ill talk a little bit about sort of some of the other thing paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so look we expect deposit growth to continue although its going to be likely at a slower rate than what was experienced so far this year and we expect our growth to continue in line with or slightly better than the industry youve got to remember that were entering a phase of tapering tapering is still qe so deposits are really not likely to decline until many quarters if you look back at historical data after qe ends if they ever do because as the economy expands the multiplier effect we could see growth in deposits even though money supply is coming down so well just have to wait and see but what we do know is as qe starts were still going to be stimulative from a deposit standpoint and then as i said if deposits do decline itll probably be many quarters or a couple years maybe after qe ends brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah gerard just a couple things when looking at the consumer deposit base sometimes i think its déjà vu all over again its a classic statement because in it was all about the feds going to normalize rates and youre going to have to raise prices and we didnt have to because the reason why we dont have to is these are core transactional accounts in a large part not interestbearing and so youll see some of that same dynamic apply again as the rates normalize and the monetary supply is changed but in the consumer business of the balances are checking so that would say those are core transaction accounts money moving in and out very little cds i think billion billion or something like that so the trillion its all basically in checking and money markets so can it move around yes if you look one of the things that bodes well for the economy is that if you look at checking customer that has maybe or in balances with us theyre sitting with three times of what they had before the crisis thats good news they will spend some of that i assume but interestingly enough thats been growing month over month for the last few months so its not going down even though the stimulus payments to customers in large part other than the childcare stopped so one thing that bodes well for the economy and this isnt trying to indiscernible you to some viewpoint about it is that consumers still has a lot of money in their accounts and theyre going to spend it bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 going back to your deposit question could that mean those balances come down a little bit but itd be overcome by the new accounts coming on at a million a year that carry a average balance et cetera so we feel good about longterm deposit growth and its driven by the checking and core transactions loantodeposit ratio its our customers drive it so when the usage by the auto dealer lines is down to of what it was because inventory is being down of course they want to borrow we want to lend to them because that means they have the inventory to sell to the consumer so this is a customerdriven business and so billionodd of loans against trillion of deposits is largely driven by the customer activity the good news is you can see in those charts that i call the smile charts on the loan growth page there that the other half of the smile is coming up meaning that the customers are starting to draw on credit and use it and thatll bode well for the customer growing their businesses and stuff but importantly thinking about just the economy generally one of the things i just want to that ill remind you of gerard is we break out consumer and gwim and a lot of people talk about retail deposits that is trillion when you combine them together so is a big machine and its all transactional and we just dont think that moves as much on monetary supply questions as obviously the institutional side gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning hey brian i wanted to ask weve got a setup into that looks pretty positive especially when you think about the topdown gdp growth you were mentioning earlier how are you leaning into that with regard to your footprint where do you see the biggest opportunity for share gain across your business platform brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so id say theres a of couple areas one as youre well aware of weve expanded the balance sheet in the markets business and are seeing that returns on that stronger in the equities business and good and jim demare and the team under toms leadership continue to do a bit strong in the equities business in that so deploying balance sheet against that recognizing the activity level sustaining et cetera and then if you go in the lending business its customer selection so we were out with those extra relationship managers banging away at the world getting more customers the hard way and youre seeing net new customers in the business bank and small business segments and stuff growing you see that in the wealth management business bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 so what youll see is that the balance sheet deployed to markets is a capital and balance sheet question everywhere else its going to follow the customer but its the core customer growth and thats why you put those statistics in that you see meanwhile merrill edge is over billion and becoming a fairly significant enterprise on its own and you see some of these other aspects so we feel good about it and like you said candace and the team run a great research platform and they basically are plus this year and next year which sets up well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so is there an opportunity thats even larger outside the us im just thinking about your franchise outside the us borders is that an engine of growth for you potentially here relative to what youve been doing brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah well invest well continue to expand our we have more loans in the global corporate and investment banking segment outside the us than we do inside the us and we continue to expand that matthew koder and team have done a good job lead the client and team in the corporate banking area doing a great job so yes were going to invest in that and then the gts faiz ahmad and the team and continue to develop our capabilities there and were getting high singledigit revenue growth off the deposits and fees combined together and we continue to invest in that realtime payments and its just one thing after another so were doing that but outside which yeah i dont if the question is are we going to change and go into the consumer business or wealth management business outside the us the opportunities in the consumer business or just in the wealth management business in the us are staggering to us think about we just opened our 15th branch in indianapolis you and i would have been talking four years ago and i dont think we had any ph maybe just five were now seventh in market share moving up strong you look at it in columbus in cleveland in cincinnati in salt lake city in minneapolis and youre seeing us move in the top five seven from zero and that growth in the new households is running multiples of in merrill and the private bank theres just so much opportunity to distract ourselves would be not the time to do it were in a war with the competition and were winning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just lastly paul you were mentioning how youve got bigger than breadbox on growth in nii as you look into next year and you outlined the drivers im just wondering embedded in that is a forward curve what about opportunity here for the forward curve to shift higher when youre thinking about the increase in nii if we had inflation come through stronger rates rise sooner would that be an opportunity for you to take even more duration than youve got in the book or would you keep the securities duration where it is today paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp look we have a lot of excess liquidity right now so theres always an opportunity to deploy some of that in the future were always balancing liquidity capital and earnings and if rates rise i think we probably would have to study whether we want to deploy some of that liquidity at higher rates weve got our interest rate sensitivity disclosure which is probably the best way to talk about the opportunity if rates were to rise it fits today because of our liability ph insensitivity the value of those deposits as customer relationships as brian just bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 talked about thats sitting at billion for a parallel shift of that is on the shortend so that gives you a sense of maybe the opportunity here as rates rise betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks operator our next question comes from jim mitchell with seaport research your line is open james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners hey good morning maybe just a question one of your peers this morning talked about the impact of saccr adoption i think it disclosed that standardized rwas could grow to is that a similar impact for you just trying to get a sense of how you think about the adoption of that paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp we already adopted saccr i think and that was a benefit for us in markets james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners oh really paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah and lee can come back to you with the details we were the first to adopt james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners okay well thats great and then so when we think about the buybacks the billion the acceleration of buybacks this quarter is should we just expect that acceleration to continue until you get towards your target of around to paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yes i mean simply put we manage it dynamically the board manages it dynamically on a quarterly basis and whats happening is if you look at where we thought wed be were ending up with more capital because were earning more money and then we clean up a little bit here and there but were working towards over multi quarter period towards where back towards our target and well continue to focus on that james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners okay thats great thanks operator our next question comes from ph charles peabody with portales your line is open bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 q actually my question was asked but on the nii youre if you just extrapolate third fourth quarter kind of guidance youre looking at a midsingle digit rate of growth yearoveryear in and i think you used the word modest nii growth is expected for in that what sort of yield curve or nominal rate environment are you assuming to get above or towards that level paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp let me just correct you i think if you didnt hear us right or we said something wrong but were expecting modest nii growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter q oh okay paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah we gave some perspective in the initial comments that i made about versus were not really providing specific guidance on but let me just give you a couple of reminders and qualifiers that its going to depend nii is going to depend on loan and deposit growth and we expect both of those to continue to grow consistent with a growing economy we also are expecting lower premium amortization expense over time consistent with the ph path for forward rates when all the guidance we ever give you is always dependent on the forward curve at that moment so assuming the current forward curve and given our expectations around improvement in nii in the second half of this year weve already booked the third quarter ive given you guidance on the fourth quarter that one could expect i think robust improvement in nii comparing the full year versus the full year by the way i want to correct one thing i said earlier i mentioned that our asset sensitivity basis points rise parallel shift to the curve was billion its actually billion so sorry for that q but so on the interest rate structures what im thinking about and please help me here theres a significant amount of liquidity on bank balance sheets thats being put waiting to be put to work and im wondering if that doesnt put somewhat of a cap on how much rates can rise and then youre going to have some decline in treasury issuance because of the declining budget deficit and then youre still going to have qe at least through the first half of next year so youve got a lot of demand for shrinking supply on the treasury side so thats why im curious what sort of rate structure either nominal or curvewise youre anticipating going forward brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah all the factors that youre talking about go into it but use the curve and so all you market participants and all of the debate we dont use some internal estimate so weve always used the curve and weve been doing bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 that for a long long time going back a couple of decades so thats how we build that estimate of the asset sensitivity based on the forward curve at the time at the end of the quarter whenever we calculate it q all right thank you operator our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning and thanks for taking my questions so wanted to start off with one just on the tax rate guidance and paul youve always provided with these helpful color on how to think about some of the potential fee income drag as well associated with those esg related investments recognizing that the impacts are intended to be pl neutral i was hoping you can help size just how we should be thinking about the other income drag related to the guidance for and whether you guys would consider a potential change to the accounting just given all the noise and volatility that that creates in the income statement paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah look we expect our esg activities to increase over time so as we go into and and as we long talked about the fourth quarter is generally the highest for that pretax for that loss that we book in other income for entering into these partnerships i do think its important to remind everybody i know you know it but ill remind everybody that these partnership losses are booked in other income but theyre more than offset in the tax line so as we grow these activities in the future there will be a small headwind to revenue growth but not to net income growth given the tax benefits of these investments as you think about modeling everybody out there we expect the fourth quarter loss to be million on the other income line from these tax investments or even perhaps a little higher reflecting both the sort of typical seasonal increase in the fourth quarter and partnership investments as well as there were a few deals in the third quarter that got delayed because of all the logistical stuff and we think theyre going to pop into the fourth quarter beyond that putting the fourth quarter aside a good modeling assumption for the normal threequarters of i would say absent unusual items itll be quarterly loss of kind of million to million for those esg investments again in the other income line more than made up for in the tax line steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that color paul and just for my followup i know you guys are reluctant to give some explicit expense guidance for next year just given the sheer amount of like inbound that weve gotten after you made your remarks i just wanted to at least provide some ranges and just see if we thinking about things appropriately it does sound like the billion we saw this quarter annualizing that as a jumping off point that gets us the you have the million of additional incentive expense or seasonal expense sorry that you spoke to that gets us to and then thats the starting point for thinking about how much incremental growth somewhere in that range of to is that the right way to think about it bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp you got some but not all the components because you got the covidrelated expenses and what happens next year but i think the leading things for everybody to focus on is watch the head count because at end of the day if you think about the expense base its dominated by people and the buildings and the equipment they operate on and positioning them for success and that head count now is drifting down as it has because the impact of the run off for some of the special programs that we had the million ppp loans million customer deferral applications the unemployment payments all those stuff its going down and thats coming down so in client facing investments in technology stuff that goes up but we continue to engineer the back office but watch that number i think it was this quarter if i got it right down for the quarter down for the year managers are down about in the company round numbers at this point and we just continue to manage that down so youve got the component parts that have come clear we sort of brought the run rate back down to flat yearoveryear and well continue to work on it paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah the only other thing that i would add brian if i may were clearly focused on managing expenses well but what were really focused on is creating operating leverage and you saw that this quarter and thats how we really think about the business model weve got to grow revenue and in terms of expense growth weve got to grow expenses slower than were growing revenue and weve given you the sort of percentage framework steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc all right thats great and just one quick followup if i may just on the securities yield you guys actually saw some nice expansion there i know thats going to be reflected at least in part of some of the premium and benefit that was cited i was hoping you could maybe help frame how large could that benefit be from premium am if prepay speeds really start to normalize in earnest some are closer to precovid levels and then separately just where are you reinvesting along the curve and how youre thinking about duration and risk appetite given the size of your mbs portfolio paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah i mean if you think about premium amortization expense over time its going to depend on the path of rates and i just would remind you that prepayments lags movements in mortgage rates people tend to focus on the 10year its about mortgage rates and they lag that by a little more than two months and i would also just remind everybody that as you think about premiumization expense its also important to really remember that the size of the sort of the securities portfolio has increased a lot yearoveryear so all those things sort of have to go into your modeling steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc understood thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies your line is open bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning just a question or two on card interesting to see that your purchase credit card volumes continued to grow really nicely and debit did come down a little bit so did the overall interchange fees just wondering if you can talk through what youre just seeing in terms of the underlying trend there and is that stimulus starting to change as far as debit or was it delta variant and just what do you see in terms of the forward outlook for in terms of your views of spend trend and balances in card thank you paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp sure well look in card income just a couple of points to make just so no ones confused when you look at our sort of consumer banking card income fees they were up very nicely year over year at about driven as you said by the purchase volume increases despite the fact that payment rates were still relatively high but when you look at the consolidated line youre not going to see that its up only slightly versus  because of the decline in card income associated with processing unemployment claims which sits in global markets so just some clarification there in terms of balances look were expecting card balances to continue to improve that balances grew quarter over quarter on an annualized basis including some small growth in revolving balances and we opened over million new accounts which now matches prepandemic levels i think balance growth reflected higher spend and the reinitiated marketing efforts that we talked about including promo offers while again payment rates remained elevated we expect higher  seasonal purchase volume and thats going to drive additional balances in cards steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah i think just a couple things you got the balance question on cards but you do always have to look at the spending side of it and we said debit and credit cards are only about 20percentodd of the way consumers spend money out of accounts cash out of the atms checks written zelle is taking off and becoming a meaningful amount of the payments so i think that cards are an easy form of payment were already seeing tap cards and things at of the penetration already so but the good news is no matter how you cut it and how you look at it there are two good messages card balances are growing but theres still tremendous capacity for the consumers to borrow if they want to do things the second thing is that the spending levels are growing at growth rates an economy in the us which is led by the american consumer that is a tremendous amount of spending thats going on and its accelerating even as the stimulus is not is in the rearview mirror by quite a many months so as people get back to work in higher wages and things theres just more money to spend so i think the focus on card as a spending vehicle versus a borrowing vehicle would be or will be something we look at but we like the business we continue to generate million new cards as paul talked about and it will break down about who needs to borrow and what and the asset quality is unbelievable the nim is high as its ever been and thats a good business bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thanks a lot guys operator our final question comes from chris kotowski with oppenheimer your line is open brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp morning chris chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc yeah good morning and thank you im trying to kind of disaggregate the strength in net interest income and just wanted to make sure i have all the moving parts right so the ppp revenues were up million and amortization was down million its still kind of implies like a million or roughly kind of linked quarter growth in nii up against say average loan growth if i have that right is there an explanation for that strength is its the securities you put on or is it how did it become quite that strong paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp you got to add an extra day chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc extra day okay thats more paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp and then what youre left with i think is the loan growth for two quarters now and we took in a lot of deposits quarteroverquarter we put some of those towards the loan growth we put some of those in cash and we put some of those in the securities portfolio chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay and if you had to guess if with the size of the securities portfolio that you have now if you were in a say kind of rate environment the billion in amortization currently what would that go to if you can say brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp you can look at that by just tracking cprs and make your estimates you know the size of the portfolio and the basis but just backing up a little bit this loan growth in the first quarter we said we thought we were seeing the stabilization and there was a lot of people fulminated against that saying wait how can that be true the second quarter we said in the second half of the quarter especially we saw growth all that loan stayed on the books plus we grew it on top of that as we said earlier i think billion excluding the ppp thats whats going to build into the nii projections going forward because thats basis point spread stuff bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 and remember were funding it with zero cost deposits to the tune of million to billion up yearover year so thats what will drive it long term shortterm it will be all the things you talked about but thats going to stabilize it somewhere at a point and then its really going to come back down to what we do on the banking side of the balance sheet make loans take deposits and make the spread between them and the best news is the nim percentage actually started moving up and that shows you that the stabilization leads to that coming true as we grow the loans chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc it was an awesome quarter thank you thats it for me thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp we agree with that thats all brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp all right thank you all for your attention just to close the quarter out i could just take chris comment and say weve returned to organic growth trends seen prepandemic we saw solid loan demand good revenue growth yearoveryear expenses flat yearoveryear for great operating leverage of returning to that effort to drive that quarterbyquarter to make the great investments to drive the franchise at the same time having expense discipline billion of capital went back to you this quarter well continue to return the excess capital and all the current earnings because frankly we can grow without retaining capital because of the core way we run the business on a risk basis we continue to do what we need to do in our communities outside at the same time and just in closing i want to thank paul for his service as cfo and we look forward to alastair and the
