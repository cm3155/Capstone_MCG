moynihan chair chief executive officer bank of america corp thank you lee and thank you all of you for joining us today this quarter thanks to a great team here at bank of america we reported billion in net income or per diluted share we delivered on our fourth straight quarter of operating leverage we grew revenue while expense rose for of operating leverage compared to quarter two we also saw a yearoveryear improvement in nii these earnings generated return on tangible common equity of and return on assets of basis points as a reminder when comparing our earnings in the second quarter of to the earnings this quarter in the second quarter of we recorded two items of note in that quarter net income benefited by billion from a tax adjustment for a uk tax law change and that was worth to eps we also released billion in credit reserves during that quarter that benefited earnings by billion or in eps this will bring that quarters reported eps of down to the low and that compares to this quarters per share this gain is illustrated by the increase in pretax preprovision income which would exclude those two impacts and that was billion this quarter improving in ppnr improvement from the second quarter of so lets go to slide and lets talk about some of the drivers of results the organic growth engine at bank of america that existed prepandemic is back in full place here and you can see that in the second quarter of this reflects in net new checking account openings net new consumer investment accounts net new household growth in wealth management very strong loan growth across all products and good performance by global markets and investment banking teams even given a quarter with volatile capital markets our expense management continues strong and it benefits by the best digital banking platform in the world once again we drove more users saw more logins and usage and that generated more sales from the platform compared to last year our asset quality remains very strong with net chargeoffs in the second quarter of still below prepandemic levels in late when credit was pretty good breaking down the performance by segment id make a few comments our consumer banking segment continue to see good momentum as we grew loans at the fastest quarterly pace in nearly three years we added more than net new checking accounts in the quarter in the second quarter alone we opened new financial centers and renovated others and deepened digital engagement with both consumer and small business clients and after considering the highly elevated consumer income tax outflows payments of taxes which is good for government we saw good deposit activity in our wealth management segment in a period of declining market values where stocks and bonds had the worst first half in five decades revenues still grew in that business yearoveryear and we expanded our pre tax margin our banking business ph we had clients that overcame those market values and weakness we added more than net new households across merrill and private bank across our entire wealth platform merrill the private bank and our consumer investments team merrill lynch client balances including deposits investments and loans totals trillion at aided by nearly billion of client inflows over the last year into those businesses bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 our global banking team grew loans linked quarter thats in a single quarter annualized we also saw global treasury services revenue as customers utilized our service ph to manage their quality stand up well in the quarter overall revenue in global banking was impacted by the weaker investment banking fees that were available in this volatile market lower investment banking fees and we also had marks as previously discussed to our leveraged finance positions our nii improvement nearly offset all those impacts leaving revenue only modestly down yearoveryear we maintained our number three investment banking market share ranking in markets we had a solid quarter of sales and trading results growing from last year ex dva our macro ficc business where we have been investing over the last couple of years performed well as did the equity derivatives while other ficc businesses felt the effects of spread widening and customers taking a more riskoff position from a broader enterprise our pl perspective quarter two expense was down modestly from quarter one and consistent with what we told you on our last call it is notable that we achieved that even as quartertwo included approximately million in regulatory matters that alastair will discuss in a few minutes as i said earlier one of the reasons we continue to have good expense results and continued progress on digital engagement across the businesses i ph command you to look at slides and in our appendix where we set forth our digital operating results by lines of business overall digital sales continued to grow up digital choice for payments continued to grow zelle transactions continued to outdistance checks written crossing over last year and the gap continues to widen erica is approaching billion interactions since we started with it clients have filled out million life plans enhancing our asset growth and account retention thats one of the fastest growing product implementations weve had it is also worth noting the strong credit quality most all of that asset quality metrics improved again this quarter you will note however the chargeoffs rose in quarter two but this increase was largely due to some loan sale accounting and some other credit decisions due to the past pandemic issues as ive done for several quarters i want to make a few points about customer activity lets go to slide by our data across the million core checking households plus we have in million consumers in america us consumers remain quite resilient i would offer a few thoughts as you look at slide in addition ill give you what we see so far in july in a moment first consumers continue to spend at a healthy pace even as quite some time has passed since the receipt of any stimulus second the overall average deposit balances for most client cohorts are higher than they were both last quarter and even rose in june versus may they remain at multiples above the prepandemic levels and importantly were seeing no deterioration in our customers asset quality and they have the capability to borrow our customer data shows bank of america customers spend at the highest quarterly period on record in quarter two at trillion in total spending thats up yearoveryear this quarter also was the highest debit spending period on record for us but as you think about more recently just to give you the more recent statistics in june spending was up over june transactions also rose more than for the first two weeks of july the spending is up 10plus and transactions again rising 6plus this is strong consumer resilience we continued to see shifts in what people are spending on as the quarter took place more on experiences travel and things like that and a bit and bit more on fuel due to increased prices and less on retail stores in quarter bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 two we saw that higher gas spend as well as a continued recovery in the travel categories and continued recovery in restaurant spending on the lowerright hand chart youll note the continued shift in how people spend money ph as check and cash volumes continue to come down and are replaced by digital alternatives this continues to help on our cost structure regarding our customer liquidity average deposit balance of our customers remained at high levels relative to the year ago and prepandemic periods they are largely unchanged for the mass market customers they rose about over june from may the only area where we had any change to the negative was a small dip for the most affluent segments of those customers that reflects the tax payments made in april and the build back coming more slowly for those customers in addition to this data ill refer you to slides and which completes the resiliency picture this shows you strong asset quality across our consumers also look at elevated payment rates on credit cards that means people paying off their debt at a good clip theres no real differentiation across the trends in of customer cohorts even for the very small portion of our card book there is a lower credit quality so while this is good news it clearly makes the feds job tougher when you take these statistics and this activity and combine it with low unemployment rate i want to switch gears now and talk a little bit more about credit weve provided more information on credit this quarter as would be obvious given the debate about a future recession ph while theres debate and discuss this potential outcome we just continue to drive responsible growth at our company and so were prepared so if you look at slide you can see how much the loan book has changed under more than a decade of responsible growth as you can see on the topleft chart our loan book is quite wellbalanced now between consumer and commercial loans focusing on the topright chart note that the consumer portfolio is even more collateralized with a greater mix of mortgage and less card in addition much less second mortgage and obviously second mortgages today underwritten clearly differently than they were in the mid2000 to decade and all consumer portfolios have much higher ficos in the bottomleft chart youll note the more diversified commercial mix as well and if you look at the lowerright chart you can see our results on the stress test and how they fared time and time again when you go to slide we gave you a little detail on what we look like in the height of last crisis compared to where we are now you can see the loan portfolio in when risk were at the peak for bank of america because this was after wed closed the merrill and the countrywide transactions and the company was all put together we give you those metrics what they look like prepandemic at the end of and what they look like today on the right are the changes weve made under that decadeplus of responsible growth given all these changes of our commercial loan book today is either investment grade or secured and while there is not much difference in something like the commercial real estate book you have to look underlying to see the changes for instance the land development loans have decreased from billion in to million currently and secured residential exposure decreased from billion to million now weve also included a few slides on our appendix pages to that highlight the consumer resilience and delinquency points as well as the consumer lending statistics highlighting this continued strong quality of all our originations take note of the ficos on this newly originated activity there so in the end despite the worries of a bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 slowing economy and other global issues client activity remained good this quarter nii has improved quickly and our customers resilience and health remains strong we recognized some expense from regulatory matters and still managed to keep expenses flat to the first quarter and in line with what we told you we continue to drive strong operating leverage in a weaker capital markets environment these earnings are delivering strong returns and delivering capital back to shareholders in thinking about capital remember first we use our capital to support customers and related loans and we continue to invest in the franchise second we are delivering capital back to you as shareholders we now intend to increase our dividend in quarter three which would have our dividend higher than it was just months ago in addition we retired shares this quarter third were going to be building capital given the new higher minimums received during the stress test itll make our balance sheet even stronger along the way we believe our expected earnings generation over the next months will provide an ample amount of capital which allows us to support customer growth pay dividends and use the rest to allocate between buying back shares and growing into our new capital requirement and with that ill turn it over to alastair alastair borthwick chief financial officer bank of america corp thank you brian and since brian hit the highlights of the income statement i just want to reiterate we saw good returns in the quarter with return on tangible common equity of and return on assets of basis points so im going to begin my comments on slide and the balance sheet and as you can see during the quarter the balance sheet declined billion to a little more than trillion and that reflected an billion decline in deposits and a decrease in our global markets balance sheet we utilized a combination of cash and some rotation from securities this quarter to fund our loans growth given the decline in deposits our average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter reflecting a drop in deposits and lower securities valuation and it remains very elevated at nearly trillion for reference that was billion prepandemic just to give you an idea of how much liquidity has increased over the period shareholders equity increased billion from  with a few different components we should note shareholders equity benefited from net income after preferred dividends of billion and the issuance of billion in preferred stock so thats billion flowing into equity we paid out billion in common dividends and net share repurchases aoci declined as a result of the increase in loan rates and we saw that impact in two ways first we had a reduction from a change in the value of our availableforsale debt securities of billion and that impacts cet1 second rates also drove a billion decline in aoci from derivatives that does not impact cet1 and that reflects cash flow hedges mostly put in place last year against some of our variable rate loans and that provided some nii growth and also protected cet1 at the same time with that equity growth we saw book value increase in the quarter with regard to regulatory capital our supplemental leverage ratio increased basis points to versus our minimum requirement of leaving plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth and our tlac ratio remains comfortably above our requirements bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 okay lets turn to slide and well talk about cet1 where our capital levels remain very strong we have billion of cet1 and a cet1 ratio which increased from the first quarter and remains well above our second quarter minimum requirement that cet1 ratio is also expected to be just above our new requirement from ccar when its confirmed by regulators at the end of august and that new level will be effective for us on october ill walk through the drivers of the cet1 ratio this quarter first billion of earnings net of preferred dividends which generated basis points of capital and looking at the chart you can see how we use that we grew loans by billion and with a decline in our global markets balance sheet and some loan sales and other balance sheet initiatives we were able to hold rwa flat this quarter second we returned billion of capital to shareholders representing basis points third this quarter the movement in treasury and mortgagebacked securities rates caused a decline in the fair value of our available forsale debt securities and that lowered our cet1 ratio by basis points and we remained wellpositioned for that rate movement as our hedge of a large portion of this portfolio continued to protect it from aoci movements so we ended the quarter above our expected minimum of required october and we expect to build some additional buffer on top of that in  moving beyond the third quarter we should just remind you our balance sheet growth last year means our gsib surcharge and cet1 requirement will move higher by basis points beginning in and i just want to make sure we repeat that for clarity its because i know others have different timelines for their requirements given our additional higher gsib minimum over the next six quarters well work to move above that expected cet1 minimum of by january and well look to exceed that with another basis points of internal management buffer on top of that requirement okay so now lets talk about the biggest use of cet1 this quarter and im referring to loans on slide as you review the average loan data we just want to remind you that our discipline around responsible growth has remained tight average loans have climbed back over trillion theyre up compared to  led by commercial growth of and complemented by consumer growth of each line of business and product segment reflected good growth and geographic and industry participation within that growth has also broadened over the past several quarters as we turn to linked quarter comparisons ill use ending balances and the billion linkedquarter commercial improvement came mostly from new loans and also included some improved utilization from existing clients from an asset quality standpoint of the commercial loan growth was either investment grade or secured consumer loans grew billion linkedquarter led by both credit card and mortgage and also increases in auto and securitiesbased lending and for the first time in years home equity balances increased modestly card loans grew billion from  reflecting healthy spend levels even as payments rates remain elevated within our growth our average fico was as you can see on slide in the appendix and as weve done in the past in the appendix on slide we provided that daily ending loan chart that shows trends through the quarter and you can see both commercial and consumer loans balances are now back to prepandemic periods with really only credit cards still remaining to below that period moving to deposits on slide across our past months weve seen solid growth across the client base as weve deepened relationships and added new accounts some of the yearoveryear growth was impacted by a bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 higher level of tax payments across consumer and gwim clients and businesses in  of this year those elevated tax payments drove the decline in deposits from  yearoveryear average deposits were up billion or and retail deposits with our consumer and wealth management clients grew billion and we believe our retail deposits of trillion continue to lead all competitors within the consumer balances id just like to point out the small business deposits of billion grew yearoveryear and that reflects continued reopening of small businesses across america and the consumer spending supporting their growth the average balance of these accounts is more than on wealth management we saw clients paying higher tax bills this year and we saw some move deposits to marketbased funds much of which remained in our own complex with our commercial clients deposits were up modestly yearoveryear even as customer tax payments are higher this year and some have recently begun to seek higher yields and use cash strategically for acquisitions and other operational activities turning to slide sic and net interest income on a gaap nonfte basis nii in  was billion and the fte net interest income number was billion focusing on fte nii increased billion from the second quarter of last year or and thats driven by benefits from higher interest rates including lower premium amortization and loans growth nii compared to the first quarter rose million and that came in a good bit higher than the millionplus that we signaled on our last earnings call the benefits of higher rates lower premium amortization loans growth and the additional day of interest more than offset the impact of lower securities balances our net interest yield was improving basis points from  and benefited from the rise in rates loans growth funded with cash and a basis point improvement from lower premium amortization and securities looking forward we want to provide the following nii guidance and we just have to provide a few caveats first we base the guidance on interest rates in the forward curve materializing and im referring to the curve on july second we assume modest growth in loans and deposits and third we assume deposit betas reflecting disciplined pricing to achieve our growth if those assumptions hold true we can see nii in  increase by at least million possibly billion versus  and then we expect it to grow again at a faster pace on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter and the way we think about those nii increases given the expense discipline that we have is we expect the majority of that to fall to the bottom line for shareholders focusing on asset sensitivity for a moment as you know we typically disclose our asset sensitivity based on a basis point instantaneous parallel shock in rates above the forward curve and on that forward basis asset sensitivity at june was billion of expected nii over the next months more than of that is driven by short rates thats down from billion at march largely because the benefit of higher rates is now already factored into our baseline of actual nii after we grew the million now given that the yield curve is projecting basis points of rate hikes over the next couple of meetings we thought it was also appropriate to provide the disclosure again regarding asset sensitivity on a spot basis and on bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 a spot basis our sensitivity to a basis point instantaneous rate hike would be billion or million higher than the forward basis at june okay lets turn to expense and well use slide our expenses were billion up a couple hundred million or from the yearago period and down modestly compared to the first quarter i want to focus on the more recent comparison versus the first quarter we had higher expense for regulatory matters related to certain issues and those offset the seasonal decline from the first quarter elevated payroll taxes and revenuerelated incentive costs let me pause for a moment on the million expense weve recognized for regulatory matters in the second quarter a little more than half of the amount related to fines to resolve regulatory investigations relating to our administration of prepaid unemployment benefit card programs in certain states and that we announced last week the balance of the expense relates to an industrywide issue and it concerns the use of unapproved personal devices and that has not yet been fully resolved as we look forward more broadly on expenses we continue to invest heavily in technology in people and in marketing across the businesses and we continue to add new financial centers and renovated old ones in expansion and new growth markets to help pay for those investments we continue to look for opportunities to simplify our processes and reduce work driving our costs lower to selffund our new investments our head count this quarter includes roughly summer interns and we hope they will consider us to be a great place to work and join us fulltime next year this is the most diverse group of talent weve seen yet absent the addition of those interns our head count was down a little more than associates and we like many other companies are doing many things to tackle challenging labor market conditions and were meeting that challenge pretty well so far turning to asset quality on slide i want to repeat what weve said now for many many quarters the asset quality of our customers remains very healthy and thats true in both consumer and commercial so net charge offs of million increased million from  driven by loan sales and some other credit decisions that we made as opposed to core credit deterioration absent those losses net chargeoffs were down modestly compared to the yearago period and up slightly from  provision expense was million in  driven by the chargeoffs as we had a small reserve release of million and that release includes builds for loan growth it includes builds for a dampened macroeconomic outlook in the future and the builds were offset by continued asset quality improvement and the effect of reduced pandemic uncertainty on slide were highlighting the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios and a couple of things are worth repeating again this quarter consumer delinquencies remain well below prepandemic levels and you can see the decline in reservable criticized and npls saw a modest decrease driven both by the loan sales mentioned earlier and other improvement across commercial turning to the business segments lets start with consumer banking on slide and the consumer bank earned billion on good organic growth delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of operating leverage strong top line growth of driven by net interest income improvement was more than offset by increase in provision expense resulting from the prior years much larger reserve release and while reported earnings were down pre tax preprovision earnings for consumer grew yearoveryear which highlights the earnings improvement without the impact of that reserve action bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 card revenue was solid and increased modestly yearoveryear as spending benefits were mostly offset by higher rewards costs service charges were down nearly million yearoveryear as our previously announced insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect by june the third quarter will reflect the full run rate going forward and we believe these changes are helping to improve overall customer satisfaction and further lower customer attrition expense increased as much of our increased salary and wage moves in the quarter impact consumer banking the most and as revenue grew we improved the efficiency ratio to reduced costs associated with continued shifts in client behavior to digital engagement is also allowing us to invest in higher marketing more technology and higher wages for our people we also continued our investment in financial centers opening another in the quarter while we renovated more notable customer activity highlights included net new checking accounts opened in the second quarter and marking the 14th consecutive quarter of net new consumer checking account growth this led to a record million consumer checking accounts with of them considered to be their primary account additionally small business accounts are enjoying the features of their business advantage rewards and showed growth of from last year we also grew investment accounts yearoveryear and not surprisingly the market impacted customer balances negatively on the investment side at the same time over the past months weve seen billion of positive client inflows lastly once again we opened over million credit cards in the quarter and we grew average active card accounts and saw combined credit and debit card spend up and as you saw earlier we had solid lending activity with continued low loss rates our million active digital users signed on this quarter a record billion times with our erica users up yearoveryear and we captured over million total client interactions in the second quarter alone you can see all the other digital metrics and trends on slide turning to wealth management on slide you can see we produced strong results earning billion and producing yearoveryear growth revenue growth was as nii generated through our banking assistance for these clients more than offset modest declines in assets under management fees from market impacts during a challenging quarter clients and advisors recognized this value of a holistic financial relationship across investments and banking and doing that at bank of america differentiates both merrill and the private bank and it helps to diversify and differentiate our earnings in this business compared to other brokers our talented group of financial advisors coupled with powerful digital capabilities allowed modern merrill to gain nearly net new households we also gained more in the private bank this quarter and thats a very solid showing by both given the complexities of serving our clients in challenging market conditions over the past days we added billion of loans over the last year growing and marking consecutive quarters of loans growth in the business and that is consistent and sustained performance assets under management flows and deposit growth were a little more muted this quarter as clients paid taxes impacting the quartertoquarter comparison yearoveryear our deposits were up billion and overall investment flows were billion over bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 the past four quarters with total flows of billion expenses increased driven by higher employeerelated costs and resulted in operating leverage of turning to slide and global banking youll see the business earned billion in the second quarter down million yearoveryear and driven ph by the absence of a large priorperiod reserve release and lower investment banking revenue as you know it was a tough comparative quarter for the business as the industry investment banking fee pool declined and while we acknowledge thats a big drop we just want to remind you that before the pandemic our quarterly average for investment banking fees was in the range of billion to billion compared to the billion we put up in the second quarter so we view this level as temporary and we believe it can rise back to more normal levels in the next few quarters when economic uncertainty becomes more muted while the companys overall investment banking fees declined we held on to our number three ranking in overall fees and we maintained our market share through the first half of the year compared to at the same time we saw very strong loans growth ending loans grew billion linked quarter and are up billion or year overyear that loans growth and higher rates drove net interest income growth which was able to offset the drop in investment banking fees leaving revenues in the business fairly flat yearoveryear also impacting revenue was half of the firms million leveraged finance valuation marks the market turmoil and abrupt slowdown in the second quarter sparked a downturn in the leveraged finance markets causing a number of the deals across various market participants to get marked down some of those deals have been funded and were working through any remaining exposure to get them through the market the provision expense increase reflects a reserve build of million in  compared to an million release in the yearago period and finally we saw expenses increase by driven by higher personnel costs and a share of the noted expenses for regulatory matters switching to global markets on slide and as we usually do well talk about the segment results excluding dva second quarter net income of million reflects a solid quarter of sales and trading revenue it was another quarter that favored macro trading while the credit trading businesses faced a more challenging market environment with widening spreads in the face of increased inflation fears and recession beliefs focusing on yearoveryear sales and trading contributed billion to revenue improving ficc was up while equities was up that ficc improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products while credittraded products were down weve been investing heavily over the past year in several of the macro businesses identified as opportunities for us and we were rewarded for that this quarter our strength in equities was driven by good performance in derivatives and offset by a weaker trading performance in cash lastly also impacting revenue was the other half of the firms million in leveraged finance markdowns yearoveryear expense declined reflecting the absence of costs associated with the realignment of a liquidating business activity partially offset by that share of the regulatory costs absent these impacts expense was relatively unchanged and the business generated an return in  impacted by both the elevated leveraged finance marks and regulatory matter expense finally on slide we show all other which reported a loss of million declining from the yearago period driven by the priorperiod billion tax benefit from that uk tax law change revenue is roughly a couple of hundred million higher than  due to the absence of some priorperiod structured note losses bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 expense increased as a result of the regulatory matters and the realignment of liquidating activity last year to all other and as a reminder for the financial statement presentation in this release the business segments all are taxed on the standard fully taxable equivalent basis and in all other we incorporate the impact of our esg tax credits and any other unusual items for the quarter our effective tax rate was that benefited from two things first esg investment tax credits and second roughly million of discrete tax benefits were applied to this quarter excluding those tax credits and discrete items our tax rate would have been and with that well jump into qa please thank you question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question today from glenn schorr with evercore your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much so im looking at all your credit metrics improving and a modest reserve release in the quarter and everything you said about responsible growth its all great but my question is how do you balance making sure that youre not looking too much in the back the rearview mirror and see where we came from versus what were going towards and peoples obvious concerns about the goforward and the economy and maybe within that lets just talk about what leading indicators youd look at that drive say if you thought about putting up a cecl reserve on the goforward you dont sound that concerned but like a lot of ph office people looking at a recession here thanks brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp glenn thanks for the question remember that the reserve methodology is a forwardlooking methodology and our core scenario is weighted part to the baseline part to the adverse and ends up just to give you a sense with the unemployment rate this year in the actual reservesetting scenario not an adverse case but the actual when we set the reserves ph with unemployment within the next five months so ph to so theres a conservative aspect to how the reserves are set and so basically the high quality of the loan book is not only what we talk about and show you all the stats and you can assess and look at but also you can look at the stress test results on a relative unemployment overnight yada yada yada and you see all the different statistics there and you see that on page or or whatever ph is the slide you can see us lower than everybody elses thats because many many years of responsible growth and why we showed you those pages comparing the different points in time and so i think you said something our reserve is not set looking backwards its set looking forward based on the books based on the cecl methodology we even do a comparison to where cecl day one as we call what happened then and its consistent its consistent its just the credit quality book continues to improve honestly glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 i love the seinfeld reference thank you maybe just one followup on rwa you didnt seem to need to do much i appreciate the comments you made on the prepared remarks so the question i have is there seems to be a much higher intent across the street to mitigate rwa for obvious reasons everybodys capital requirements are going up so the question i have for you is how do you balance indiscernible a belt tightening versus using your okay relative capital position to continue to grow while others are tightening the belt thanks so much alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp thanks glenn so obviously were in a little different place in than we have the capital already and we feel like over the course of the past several years weve been quite disciplined around our rwas it just remains important for us to stay at it so you saw us do a couple of things this quarter we sold a portfolio of loans that were noncore weve changed a little bit in terms of as some of the riskweighted assets in our securities portfolio are rolling off we can replace them with riskweighted like treasuries with essentially the same yield at this point so you saw what we did this quarter we grew loans we built capital we created some rwa flex in the background and we think we can do the same going forward glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thank you appreciate all that operator well go next to jim mitchell with seaport global your line is open jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning jim jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc maybe just if i look at the youre still projecting relatively healthy asset sensitivity even with the forward curve at a high level so doesnt i think when i look at the comparison versus the spot it implies not a real big degradation in betas in the forward versus the spot so can you discuss how you think about deposit betas as fed funds gets above basis points thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so we talked about the last time we were together we talked about the fact were looking backwards to to and you saw what our deposit beta was at the time it was in that sort of lowpercent and we said we hope to do better we have done better than that so far bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 now just as a reminder generally speaking we think about how we price so that we grow deposits and that growth last year was were expecting growth this year than and we said in the lowsingle digits but were going to have to see how the rate structure develops weve been pretty clear on that as well and were going to be competing in the market with others so we just have to watch that develop over time the core operating balances consumer we continue to add there over time and if were seeing kind of runoff jim its really only in the very high end of wealth management and its in the nonoperating balances in commercial so were keeping a tight eye on it but our nii reflects what we think a reasonable assumptions around deposit pricing jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc but brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah indiscernible jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc so just to clarify oh go ahead brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp jim just look at page and you can see if you look at the upperright hand corner and see the size of the non interestbearing and interest checking which is different than when it moves and you think about that even in the wealth management deposits on the lower left and then in the operating deposits in the commercial book we just have a a lot of these deposits that are money and movement in the household and weve gone through this discussion a lot a few years ago and so theyre very ph insensitive rates only because the money is always moving and its just the average collected balances in these households as opposed to money thats for investment purposes which will move and you saw it move a little bit in the wealth management business this quarter and some of the corporates will continue to position them for more investmentoriented cash for lack of better term and so wed expect that to occur but i think history is some guide here but also at the end of the day weve grown million new checking accounts yearoveryear so and that brings in more and more stable core checking balances which dont move around much and so think about all that weve been through it before and as rates go up the stuff that moves due to rate is relatively modest and we have a huge bucket of noninterestbearing that sits with us jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right so i mean clearly you guys have a highquality deposit base so i think the implication is even though were basis points you think betas can stay sort of in that well under range brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 yeah ph i mean jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc not putting words in your mouth brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp we tell our team to price consistently so they can grow faster slightly faster than the market theyve been growing a lot faster than the market because of the indiscernible stimulus and stuff like that ph but thats even the market they were growing much faster but thats what we tell them and so we dont do things to hurt the franchise jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right and then on the capital side just trying to get a sense of how quickly you want to get to a buffer and how to think about a buffer on your whether its minimum or can you still do some buybacks between now and then alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well we already have a modest buffer relative to what we expect at the end of october and then weve got obviously future capital generation and weve got some balance sheet optimization we can do so we feel like weve got a lot of flexibility so we feel like weve got some ability to do some share repurchase and then in terms of where we end up id say go fast forward to january of thats when we get the next basis point stepup so were going to generate that basis points over the next six quarters so we think well have some ability to do a little bit of everything jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thanks for taking my questions alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp thank you operator well go now to mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 hi well thanks for the nii guide i guess my question well first im if were going to be here its probably january two quarters from now well be on the earnings call and well see if your guidance is correct or not and i know you dont want to give guidance that you dont meet but you just guided for almost billion in higher nii in the next two quarters implying an billion uptick in the annualized run rate for nii i just want to make sure i heard that correctly and then on your definition of majority of that should fall to the bottom line how do you define majority is that or is it more than that alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so ill answer the question yes i think youre right we said million to billion this quarter coming up and then at least that the following quarter so yes youre right to think about that as a couple billion well get a little more precise with fourth quarter as we get to obviously a quarter from now and with respect to falling to the bottom line id say thats going to be the vast majority but ill leave that to brian brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah i think mike were bouncing around billion to billion of quarterly operating costs and you can look backwards and see that thats been fairly constant and so youd expect that to continue and so the vast vast majority falls to the bottom line its ph now the business model and you know mike as well as anybody that revenue comes through the businesses that dont need to add people or activity to get the value of it ie the consumer business and wealth management business commercial banking business and you saw that yearoveryear and as much as its a strong projection going forward we captured like billion last year second quarter this year second quarter and i think a lot of it fell to the bottom line on an applestoapples basis mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i mean just as one followup and look youve changed the firm since the global financial crisis when the company overpromised and underdelivered and youve really gone out of your way to underpromise and over deliver and so when you say a phrase like vast vast majority dont you want to hedge a little bit i mean you have a lot of inflationary pressures youre hearing talk about its harder to hire people harder to retain people you have rents you have all sorts of things happening here and youre saying vast vast majority of the additional revenues should fall to the bottom line any hedging at all youd like to give here brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp i think basically i dont id look at that quartertoquarter linkage its expenses of billion and nii we told you was up what did we say million last quarter ph turned to million yeah so we exceeded our estimates thats why we ph stayed in the next couple of quarters because weve got a pretty good line of sight to those mike so we feel pretty good about it the question that you ask all of you kept asking last quarter is how you do this and keep investing in the franchise so we increased marketing we added people in the places we wanted to add people and took people out of the places we didnt need them so much we continue to add new branches in the many cities and towns that we didnt have the branch structure and reposition in other words we invested this quarter million in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 technology codevelopment that got implemented and so but the confidence in the next quarter frankly is its already three weeks in almost and its pretty well set up so we feel pretty good mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp good morning betsy brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc two questions first is just on the investments that youre making in expanding your market share and capital markets activities youve obviously made a decision to do that and its panned out and i wanted to understand at this stage given the higher scb that you have will you still be leaning into investing and looking to take more share in the capital marketsrelated businesses brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah theyre largely as jimmy demare would say ph its the socalled growth plan we talked about starting almost twoandahalf years ago was implemented and which we increased the size of the balance sheet and you can see a little bit on page tradingrelated assets but youd have to go back a quarter a year before that and see if theyve increased and so hes built the balance sheet up to the size he thinks is relevant weve built the product capabilities out he continues to hire people in certain areas and so we feel pretty good that were pretty wellbuilt its just that weve done it and market times have got pretty interesting pretty fast and that being said if you look at the trading revenue sort of first half of the year over the last three years has been relatively stable at billion ph im not sure something like that so hes done a good job they built it up and so it doesnt need another big hump chunk of balance sheet on top of that its really in pretty good shape now and so its relative size ph in the platform is pretty well set betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 okay and then as we think about the capital ratio and the buffer i think youd been running with a 100bp buffer and should we now expect that youre going to running with bps over brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah you should betsy because frankly as it gets larger and larger it gets to be a little bit you dont need quite the buffer and so that basis points is to the if you think about we get to put basis points on top of your ph card and thats where were trying to end up betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right got it thank you operator well take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning just to follow up on the expenses how are you thinking about costs in the back half of the year and then i think you have full year guidance out there of around billion obviously you had some higher rent costs this quarter so how are you thinking about that alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so we havent changed much matt in terms of the way we think about running the company brian mentioned already if you look at the last six quarters were sort of running the place right around billion out of sight so we still feel like thats the right place that billion flattish yearoveryear and then i just i just make sure you back out and add that reg matter thats all matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc indiscernible alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp the core remains the same matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay just want to clarify on that and thats helpful and then within credit i guess what types of mortgages did you sell that generated those losses and then in all other consumer you had higher losses and you did mention there some other actions that you took and i was just wondering what those were thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 so on the resi mortgage side we sold an old portfolio of residential mortgages that we put in all other some number of years ago so this allowed us an opportunity just to exit that we do that periodically anyway but in this case it was about billion i want to say and we did have a loss so you see that loss running through but just so youre aware it was largely offset by a gain somewhere else so i wouldnt think about it as much of an economic loss but it did temporarily inflate the chargeoffs which is why we called it out and then there were a couple other things in there that related to writedowns around pandemic and stimulus and offsets with overdraft but again not what i would consider to be anywhere near the core consumer credit portfolio that we run matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay indiscernible overdraft only shows up in the all other consumer chargeoffs right alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp in this case brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah okay perfect thank you operator well go now to erika najarian with ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning i just wanted to keep on mikes theme of underpromising and overdelivering so im going to try and ask the nii question another way alastair one of your peers has started to frame nii with regards to an exit rate in the fourth quarter so and then as im just thinking about the rate sensitivity in the forward curve and your comments about loans and deposits and deposit repricing obviously youre alluding to billion by third quarter is it possible by the fourth quarter relative to everything that youre seeing going on in the company right now that the exit rate for nii could approach billion alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well id say its too early for us to tell you that right now so one of the reasons that were comfortable giving you next quarters guide is we have a pretty good sense for where loans are deposits are what we think the growth will look like et cetera the further we go out the less we control so we tried to give you that spot sensitivity and we tried to give you the forward sensitivity so you just get a general sense and then what were comfortable saying right now is its going to be in that million to billion for  and  its just a little early to say with that kind of precision so we just wanted to say we think itll accelerate again in  sorry in  so thats as precise as we want to be right now erika and its less about underpromising and overdelivering its more about theres just a lot going on right now in the markets generally and wed prefer to be precise more precise about it thats all bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc fair enough fair enough alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp and i think all were trying to convey though is we think the fourth quarter is going to be higher than the third quarter increase erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yeah alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp and thats just something i think well give you well be able to give you more sense for that based on the rate structure and what we see in deposits and loans over the course of this quarter when we meet in three months time brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp look erika this isnt vainglory to give you specific nii guidance were just trying to make sure you guys see the leverage in the platform for a quarter or two and you guys can take that and extrapolate based on your own economic projections but its meant just to give you a sense of what we see in terms of loans deposits and the pricing dynamics et cetera in the near term were more sure just like last quarter we said it would be 600odd billion and it turned out to be 800ish because were careful what we think and what we give you erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my second question is a followup on capital i guess the first is are you working to actively reduce the stress capital buffer and maybe remind us where you think the pain points were for this years test that you think you could address for next year and second should we what is the pacing of buybacks like from here as you potentially as you or not potentially as you build towards that january 1st new higher minimum brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp so on the second question thats going to be dictated by our lobs use of the balance sheet our number one goal is to keep them in the market winning every day and let the capital support that thats what we do because that what theyre doing is providing good returns and stuff so that requires us to well will be driven by frankly loan growth and more than anything else in the near term because the markets business will bounce around but wont move much in terms of the stress test look the losses and stuff were pretty good its the operating expenses and thats more continuing to point out the differences between how we run the company et cetera and well continue as bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 we look at the next years test fashion it theres not a lot we can do on the loan book and stuff its the best in the business as dictated by their results so its going to be more on convincing on operating expenses and operational losses and things like that over time erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you operator we can go now to gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi brian hi alastair brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi there can you guys share with me if you look at your deposits at the end or the average deposits in your fourth quarter of i think they totaled about trillion today you have trillion and granted consumer has grown very nicely as you pointed out brian i think its up billion over that time period can you share with us your color or your guys outlook on as quantitative tightening goes into full speed of billion or so a month how do you think that could affect your balance sheet as you look out over the next to months alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well were obviously curious with that trajectory as well we havent seen any great shift yet in deposits this second quarter was largely just a return to the normal second quarter seasonality we see we didnt see it the last two years because there was pandemic cash inflow fiscal monetary stimulus and this quarter was probably a little more elevated you saw the headlines talking about tax receipts this year were bigger than normal so we felt that but we havent seen a great deal of impact from qt just yet and it feels like our customers still want to hold a pretty healthy deposit balance so i think its natural to think about if you go back to  you think about the fact that the economy is bigger you think about the fact that the monetary base is bigger so theres probably a floor but well be watching things from here in the same way that you are brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp gerard we cant really go indiscernible against the market here because at the end of the day that growth affects the monetary accommodation the fiscal stimulus et cetera but remember as youre thinking about that trillion trillion and today trillion to trillion you do have to remember that its three years and with inflation and the economys bigger it was a trailing economy back then i think its 25ish now so you got to kind of not only put your normal growth rate which you mentioned but you also got to add to that sort of the size of the economy and our market share because our deposits reflect the economy moving in and bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 out of the system and across different money movement from consumers to businesses businesses to consumers as paychecks and stuff so i think id be careful just saying oh lets go back to normalized growth rate off that you have you have gdp and ph because youre missing that theres a stepup in size that we picked up and kept and we grew market share so itll be higher we know that but there will be some impact some monetary tightening or else it wouldnt occur and it wouldnt be the way the fed actually controls the economy to some degree gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay very good very helpful and then as a followup your loan to deposit ratio i think is around today is there an optimal level you think you can get to over the next two years and then do you fund that primarily by drawing down liquidity on the balance sheet whats your guys view on that brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp gerard we dont manage that number we manage liquidity resources leave that aside but we have a deposit business that generates deposits from customers not from pricing and not from going in the sort of broker deposits or secondary markets these are all core deposits coming in from core customers so that dictates our overall size and then we turn around and make loans to the customers based on the credit standards and capabilities we have and their demand for credit and that turns into a trillion dollars of loans and so its not a number of alastair or i or others at the top of the house say if that numbers its good and if its bad it just it is a result of running the customer franchise the amount of liquidity we have that is much more planned obviously and planned by the microsecond every day and you can see that were our ratios and stuff over the course of time you run far in excess of what we need and thatll come back down thats probably going to be more apt to come down as part of the monetary tightening process and things like that but thats basically what were doing now to manage the capital of all this is taking rwa lower rwa assets and moving them into rwa to help that and give the businesses more room to grow the core loan book but we never manage to the precise number we let the businesses operate and then we balance the interest rate risk and the capital questions and the liquidity questions at the top of the house but it works pretty well right now alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp and if you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good yeah go ahead alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp look at the last couple of quarters if you just look at the last two quarters you sort of see as the loans growth has continued to return weve as the securities have matured and prepaid weve just taken some of that liquidity and put it against loans because remember that would always been our first choice even in the bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 pandemic its just that the loans growth wasnt there its back so were using those securities and replacing them with higher yielding loans gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator well take our final question today from ken usdin with jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey thanks guys just a couple of followups on the balance sheet so just following up on the deposit side alastair in your prepared remarks you talked about modest growth in loans and deposits from here so im just wondering should we be thinking about when you talk about modest growth in deposits is that off of your periodend balance when you think about that after we get past this tax seasonality brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah think about periodend because thats where we are weve seen the deposits in the first few weeks of july have rebuilt have been stable and but yeah youve got to go off periodend because thats what you got theres some fluctuations as you get to month end and all the stuff as you well know but thats where you start from indiscernible ken usdin q analyst jefferies company indiscernible alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp and  and  seasonally tend to be the place where we build deposits ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yeah okay and then on the nii side oh sorry on the loan growth side again obviously youre putting up very strong results indiscernible industry especially in commercial and in card can you just talk about what youre thinking in terms of how loan growth looks in the second half relative to the last couple of quarters and any changes youre just sensing good or bad within the customer base and across the various loan buckets thank you alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well not a tremendous amount of change weve had good loans growth we anticipate well see good loans growth that said obviously full year were kind of at we said we thought that wed have mid to highsingle digits thats kind of what were still expecting is mid to highsingle digits there are a couple of places where for example our mortgage pipeline is down just with higher rates i think it would be natural to think that in some areas where other areas like securitiesbased lending as rates go up that might damage some loans demand bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 there and it feels like business leaders may talk themselves into less confidence so that may dampen loans growth but as of right now we think its still in that kind of mid to highsingle digits ken usdin q analyst jefferies company got it and then just one cleanup last cleanup here premiumamo was about a million helper to billion how much more improvement could you see and is that built into your expectation for third and fourth quarter alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah its built in itll keep going down obviously as rates go up but its going to its not a linear relationship its more curved so its and its our expectations are all built into our nii guidance ken usdin q analyst jefferies company understood all right thank you very much brian t moynihan chair chief executive officer bank of america corp seeing no more questions let me just close by thanking you for your time and attention as you think about bank of america for the second quarter of as we said earlier the prepandemic growth engine has kicked back in were mindful of the debate about a future recession and we have prepared the company across the last decadeplus through responsible growth to be prepared for that but as we see our current customer base we are not seeing them slow down
