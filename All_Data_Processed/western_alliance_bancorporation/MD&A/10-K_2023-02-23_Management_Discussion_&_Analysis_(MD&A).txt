information determined by methods other than those prescribed by gaap the companys management uses these nongaap financial measures in their analysis of the companys performance management believes presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the company since the presentation of these nongaap performance measures and their impact differ between companies these nongaap disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap nor are they necessarily comparable to nongaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies preprovision net revenue banking regulations define ppnr as the sum of net interest income and noninterest income less expenses before adjusting for loss provisions management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the company it enables investors and others to assess the companys ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies the following table shows the components used in the calculation of ppnr table start year ended december in millions net interest income total noninterest income net revenue total noninterest

financial measures related to regulatory capital under basel iii which includes cet and total capital the frb and other banking regulators use cet1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a banks capital adequacy therefore management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis specifically the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments in addition management believes that the classified assets to cet1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality as permitted by the regulatory capital rules the company elected to delay the estimated impact of cecl on its regulatory capital over a fiveyear transition period ending

interest income was billion an increase of billion or compared to billion for the year ended december this increase was primarily the result of a million increase in interest income from loans hfi that was driven by a billion increase in the average hfi loan balance for the year ended december and to a lesser extent higher rates interest income from investment securities also increased by

with a high degree of uncertainty the following is a summary of these critical accounting policies and significant estimates allowance for credit losses the acl guidance requires that an organization measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date including offbalance sheet credit exposures based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the acl and credit loss expense in those future periods the allowance level is influenced by loan volumes and mix average remaining maturities loan performance metrics asset quality characteristics delinquency status historical credit loss experience and other

msrs and derivative instruments that are recorded at fair value and require management to make significant judgments in estimating the fair value of these financial instruments the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market inputs for financial instruments that are actively traded and have quoted market prices or observable market inputs there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value however when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available significant management judgment may be necessary to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments the fair value of msrs is determined using a discounted cash flow model based on unobservable inputs as msrs are not traded in active markets assumptions used to value the companys msrs represent managements best estimate of assumptions that market participants would use to value this asset and may require significant judgement the primary risk of material changes to the value of the msrs resides in the potential volatility and judgment in the assumptions

liability maturities and deposit withdrawals fund asset growth and business operations and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the companys

operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources however there can be no assurance that such arrangements will not have a future effect the company has a formal liquidity policy and in the opinion of management its liquid assets are considered adequate to meet cash flow needs for loan funding and deposit cash withdrawals for the next days at december there were billion in liquid assets comprised of billion in cash and cash equivalents billion in loans hfs and billion in unpledged marketable securities at december the company maintained billion in liquid assets comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents billion in loans hfs and billion of unpledged marketable securities the parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain nonbank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted in the companys analysis of parent liquidity it is assumed that the parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders while continuing to make nondiscretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the parent and affiliated companies under this scenario the amount of time the parent and its nonbank subsidiary can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the parent liquidity analysis management believes the parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over twelve months wab maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows this capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources on a longterm basis the companys liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios for example by reducing investment or loan volumes or selling or encumbering assets further the company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities andor borrowing from correspondent banks the fhlb of san francisco and the frb at december the companys longterm liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations commitments and deposit withdrawals which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities and investment sales if necessary the companys liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities and cash flows provided by financing activities net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain noncash income and expense items such as the provision for credit losses investment and other amortization and depreciation for the years ended december and net cash provided by used in operating activities was billion billion and million respectively the companys primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans the collection of repayments of these loans and the purchase and sale of securities the companys net cash provided by and used in investing activities has been primarily influenced by its loan and securities activities the companys cash balance during the years ended december and was reduced by billion billion and billion respectively as a result of a net increase in loans as well as a net increase in investment securities of billion billion and billion respectively net cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by increased deposit levels during the years ended december and net deposits increased billion billion and billion respectively fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the companys need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity and as nonmaturity deposits such as checking and savings account balances are withdrawn additionally the company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits due in part to the fdic limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors to mitigate the uninsured deposit risk the company participates in the cdars and ics programs which allow an individual customer to invest up to million and million respectively through one participating financial institution or a combined total of million per individual customer with the entire amount being covered by fdic insurance as of december the company has million of cdars and billion of ics deposits as of december the company has billion of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others a traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid the total amount of dividends which may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank dividends paid by wab to the parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the banks capital to

the company would have sufficient capital to maintain regulatory capital levels throughout an economic downturn as a result of passage of the egrrcpa bank holding companies with less than billion in

risk management requirements therein notwithstanding these changes the capital planning and risk management practices of the company and the bank will continue to be reviewed through the regular

proprietary trading and ii investing in or sponsoring certain covered funds subject to certain limited exceptions under the volcker rule the term covered funds is defined as any issuer that would be an investment company under the investment company act but for the exemption in section 3c1 or 3c7 of that act which includes clo and cdo securities there are also several exemptions from the definition of covered fund including among other things loan securitizations joint ventures certain types of foreign funds entities issuing assetbacked commercial paper and registered investment companies further the final rules permit banking entities subject to certain conditions and limitations to invest in or sponsor a covered fund in connection with organizing and offering the covered fund certain riskmitigating hedging activities and de minimis investments in covered funds compliance with the volcker rule was required by july the egrrcpa and subsequent promulgation of interagency

compliant with the volcker rule including as modified by the new rule dividends the company has paid regular quarterly dividends since the third quarter of whether the company continues to pay quarterly dividends and the amount of any such dividends will be at the discretion of wals bod and will depend on the companys earnings financial condition results of operations business prospects capital requirements regulatory restrictions contractual restrictions and other factors that the bod may deem relevant the companys ability to pay dividends is subject to the regulatory authority of the frb the supervisory concern of the frb focuses on a bank holding companys capital position its ability to meet its financial obligations as they come due and its capacity to act as a source of financial strength to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in addition frb policy discourages the payment of dividends by a bank holding company that is not supported by current operating earnings as a delaware corporation the company is also subject to limitations under delaware law on the payment of dividends under the delaware general corporation law dividends may only be paid out of surplus or out of net profits for the year in which the dividend is declared or the preceding year and no dividends may be paid on common stock at any time during which the capital of outstanding preferred stock or preference stock exceeds the companys net assets from time to time the company may become a party to financing agreements and other contractual obligations that have the effect of limiting or prohibiting the declaration or payment of dividends under certain circumstances holding company expenses and obligations with respect to its outstanding trust preferred securities and corresponding subordinated debt also may limit or impair the companys ability to declare and pay dividends since the company has no significant assets other than the voting stock of its subsidiaries it currently depends on dividends from wab and to a lesser extent its nonbank subsidiaries for a substantial portion of its revenue and as the primary sources of its cash flow the ability of a state member bank such as wab to pay cash dividends is restricted by the frb and the state of arizona the frbs regulation h states that a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during that calendar year exceed the banks net income during that calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two years further without receiving prior approval from both the frb and twothirds of its shareholders a bank cannot declare or pay a dividend that would exceed its undivided profits or withdraw any portion of its permanent capital under section of the arizona revised statutes wab may pay dividends on the same basis as any other arizona corporation except that cash dividends paid out of capital surplus require the prior approval of the arizona superintendent under section of the arizona revised statutes a corporation may not make a distribution to stockholders if to do so would render the corporation insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they become due however an arizona bank may not declare a nonstock dividend out of capital surplus without the approval of the arizona superintendent federal reserve system as a member of the federal reserve system wab has historically been required by law to maintain reserves against its transaction deposits which were to be held in cash or with the frb in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve reduced the reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on march additionally on june the federal reserve adopted amendments to regulation d reserve requirements of depository institutions cfr part to eliminate references to an interest on required reserves rate and to an interest on excess reserves rate and replace them with a reference to a single interest on reserve balances rate the amendments also simplified the formula used to calculate the amount of interest paid on balances maintained by or on behalf of eligible institutions in master accounts at federal reserve banks and to made other conforming amendments the rule became effective on july source of strength doctrine frb policy requires bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks section of the doddfrank act codified the requirement that bank holding companies act as a source of financial strength as a result the company is expected to commit resources to support wab including at times when the company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks the us bankruptcy code provides that in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment capital adequacy the capital rules established a comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the capital rules generally implement the basel committees basel iii final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards the capital rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios the capital rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios and replaced the existing general riskweighting approach with a more risksensitive approach the capital rules i include cet1 and the related regulatory capital ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets ii specify that tier capital consists of cet1 and additional tier capital instruments meeting certain revised requirements iii mandate that most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 and not to the other components of capital and iv expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations under the capital rules for most banking organizations the most common form of additional tier capital is noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common forms of tier capital are subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses in each case subject to the capital rules specific requirements pursuant to the capital rules the minimum capital ratios are as follows cet1 to riskweighted assets tier capital that is cet1 plus additional tier capital to riskweighted assets total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets and tier capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements called leverage ratio the capital rules also include a capital conservation buffer composed entirely of cet1 in addition to these minimum riskweighted asset ratios the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity and other capital instrument repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall the capital rules became fully phasedin on january thus the capital standards applicable to the company include an additional capital conservation buffer of of cet1 effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least ii tier capital to riskweighted assets of at least and iii total capital to riskweighted assets of at least the capital rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing assets dtas arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds of cet1 or all such items in the aggregate exceed of cet1 the capital rules further prescribe that the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items reported as a component of stockholders equity be included in cet1 capital however nonadvanced approaches banking organizations may make a onetime permanent election to exclude these items the company as a nonadvanced approaches institution has made this onetime election the capital rules also preclude certain hybrid securities such as trust preferred securities issued on or after may from inclusion in bank holding companies tier capital the company has used trust preferred securities in the past as a tool for raising additional tier capital and otherwise improving its regulatory capital ratios although the company may continue to include its existing trust preferred securities as tier capital the prohibition on the use of these securities as tier capital going forward may limit the companys ability to raise capital in the future the riskweighting categories in the capital rules are standardized and include a risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from for us government and agency securities to for certain equity exposures and higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes as of april final rules became effective simplifying the capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets certain dtas investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interest management believes the company is in compliance and will continue to be in compliance with the targeted capital ratios in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal bank regulatory authorities issued a final rule in late august that allows institutions that adopted the cecl accounting standard in to mitigate cecls estimated effects on regulatory capital for two years followed by a threeyear transition period the company has elected this capital relief option prompt corrective action and safety and soundness pursuant to section of the fdia federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action should a depository institution fail to meet certain capital adequacy standards at each successive lower capital category an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions including restrictions on growth restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits furthermore if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan based upon its capital levels a bank that is classified as wellcapitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment for purposes of prompt corrective action to be i wellcapitalized a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least a tier risk based capital ratio of at least a cet1 risk based capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least ii adequately capitalized a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least a tier risk based capital ratio of at least a cet1 risk based capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least iii undercapitalized a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than a tier risk based capital ratio of less than a cet1 risk based capital ratio of less than and a tier leverage ratio of less than iv significantly undercapitalized a bank would have a total risk based capital

qualifies for the exemption the glba also requires that financial institutions implement comprehensive written information security programs that include administrative technical and physical safeguards to protect consumer information further pursuant to interpretive guidance issued under the glba and certain state laws financial institutions are required to notify customers of security breaches that result in unauthorized access to their nonpublic personal information for example under california law every business that owns or licenses personal information about a california

materially affectedor are reasonably likely to materially affectthe viability of a banking organizations operations its ability to deliver banking products and services or the stability of the financial sector in addition the rule requires a bank service provider to notify affected banking organization customers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a computersecurity incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect banking organization customers for four or more hours the rule became effective may these laws and

officer employee director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation fees or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity the federal banking agencies and the sec most recently proposed such regulations in but the regulations have not yet been finalized if the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed they will restrict the manner in which executive
