whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise recent banking industry and market developments the bank failures that occurred in march caused significant disruption in the united states banking industry particularly among midsize banks such as the company the closures of these banks triggered a surge in deposit outflows and stock price volatility at many midsized banks in response to these bank failures the frb announced the btfp which offers loans of up to one year in length to banks savings associations credit unions and other eligible depository institutions pledging us treasuries agency debt and mortgagebacked securities and other qualifying assets as collateral valued at par under this program the bank has access to billion in borrowing capacity of which billion was drawn at june additionally the department of the treasury frb and fdic issued a joint statement which stated that losses to support uninsured deposits of those failed banks would be recovered via a special assessment on banks the fdic has proposed an annual special assessment rate of approximately basis points the assessment base for the special assessments would be equal to an institutions estimated uninsured deposits as of december adjusted to exclude the first billion from estimated uninsured deposits the special assessments would be collected over an eightquarter collection period at a quarterly special assessment rate of basis points with the first quarterly assessment period beginning on january the comment period for the proposal ended on july with a final rule expected later this year if adopted as proposed the company expects to recognize a onetime charge of million the recent volatility in the banking industry and other recent regulatory actions have had and may continue to have a material impact on the companys operations as further discussed below capital and liquidity while the company believes it has sufficient capital funding and access to contingent sources of liquidity the company has taken several actions to ensure the strength of its capital and liquidity position these actions included disposition of selected assets including million of afs securities and billion of loans during the six months ended june and increasing its borrowing capacity with the frb the companys deposit balances stabilized as of march and from such

loss adjustment primarily related to the transfer of loans to hfs a loss of million on sales of investment securities and a million gain on extinguishment of debt the continued uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the volatility in the banking industry and related economic effects may continue to affect the companys estimate of its allowance for credit losses and resulting provision for credit losses to the extent the impact of the recent banking industry volatility is prolonged and economic conditions worsen or persist longer than forecast such estimates may be insufficient and may change significantly in the future the companys net interest margin also may be negatively impacted in future periods if the companys borrowings remain elevated these uncertainties and the economic environment will continue to affect earnings growth and may result in deterioration of asset quality in the companys loan and investment portfolios depositors in the technology industry are generally considered to be the most impacted by recent events and may have greater sensitivity to the recent volatility in the banking industry with potentially longer recovery periods than other types of businesses the companys deposit exposure to the technology industry totaled billion or of total deposits as of june asset valuation sustained declines in the companys stock price andor other liquidity related impacts such as increases in deposit outflows could give rise to triggering events in the future that could result in a writedown in the value of our goodwill which could have a

than those prescribed by gaap the companys management uses these nongaap financial measures in their analysis of the companys performance management believes presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the company since the presentation of these nongaap performance measures and their impact differ between companies these nongaap disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap nor are they necessarily comparable to nongaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies preprovision net revenue banking regulations define ppnr as the sum of net interest income and noninterest income less expenses before adjusting for loss provisions and has been further adjusted for nonoperating items incurred during the periods indicated in the table below management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the company it enables investors and others to assess the companys ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies the following table shows the components used in the calculation of ppnr three months ended june six months ended june

the frb and other banking regulators use cet1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a banks capital adequacy therefore management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis specifically the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments in addition management believes that the classified assets to cet1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality as permitted by the regulatory capital rules the company elected to delay the

income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders while continuing to make nondiscretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the parent and affiliated companies under this scenario the amount of time the parent and its nonbank subsidiary can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the parent liquidity analysis management believes the parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over twelve months wab maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows this capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources on a longterm basis the companys liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios for example by reducing investment or loan volumes or selling or encumbering assets further the company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities andor borrowing from correspondent banks the fhlb of san francisco and the frb at june the companys longterm liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations commitments and deposit withdrawals which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities and investment sales if necessary the companys liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications cash

fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the companys need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity and as nonmaturity deposits such as checking and savings account balances are withdrawn additionally the company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits due in part to the fdic limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors to mitigate the uninsured deposit risk the company participates in the cdars and ics programs which allow an individual

nonreciprocal brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others a traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid the total amount of dividends which may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank dividends paid by wab to the parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof
