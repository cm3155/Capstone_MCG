contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by gaap the companys management uses these nongaap financial measures in their analysis of the companys performance management believes presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the company since the presentation of these nongaap performance measures and their impact differ between companies these nongaap disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap nor are they necessarily comparable to nongaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies preprovision net revenue ppnr is defined by the federal reserve in sr which requires companies subject to the rule to project ppnr over the planning horizon for each of the economic scenarios defined annually by the regulators banking regulations define ppnr as net interest income plus noninterest income less noninterest expense management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the company it enables investors and others to assess the companys ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies the following table shows the components of ppnr for the three and nine months ended september and three months ended september nine months ended september in millions net interest income total noninterest income net revenue total noninterest expense less acquisition and restructure expense total noninterest expense adjusted preprovision net revenue1 less acquisition and restructure expense provision for recovery of credit losses income tax expense net income we believe this nongaap measurement is a key indicator of the earnings power of the company efficiency ratio the following table

equity the following table presents financial measures related to tangible common equity tangible common equity represents total stockholders equity less identifiable intangible assets and goodwill management believes that tangible common equity financial measures are useful in evaluating the companys capital strength financial condition and ability to manage potential losses in addition

related to regulatory capital under basel iii which includes common equity tier and total capital the frb and other banking regulators use cet1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a banks capital adequacy therefore management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis specifically the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments in addition management believes that the classified assets to cet1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality as permitted by the regulatory capital rules the company elected to delay the estimated impact of cecl on its regulatory capital over a fiveyear transition period ending

liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the companys business operations or unanticipated events including the ongoing covid19 pandemic the ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors creditors and regulators the companys liquidity represented by cash and amounts due from banks federal funds sold and nonpledged marketable securities is a result of the companys operating investing and financing activities and related cash flows in order to ensure funds are available when necessary on at least a quarterly basis the company projects the amount of funds that will be required over a twelvemonth period and it also strives to maintain relationships with a diversified customer base liquidity requirements can also be met through shortterm borrowings

at december the company maintained billion in liquid assets comprised of billion of cash and cash equivalents and billion of unpledged marketable securities the parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain nonbank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted since deposits are taken by wab and not by the parent parent liquidity is not dependent on the banks deposit balances in the companys analysis of parent liquidity it is assumed that the parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders while continuing to make nondiscretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the parent and affiliated companies under this scenario the amount of time the parent and its nonbank subsidiary can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the parent liquidity analysis management believes the parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over twelve months wab maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows this capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources on a longterm basis the companys liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios for example by reducing investment or loan volumes or selling or encumbering assets further the company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities andor borrowing from correspondent banks the fhlb of san francisco and the frb at september the companys longterm liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations commitments and deposit withdrawals which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities and investment sales if necessary the companys liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities and cash flows provided by financing activities net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain noncash income and expense items such as the provision for credit losses investment and other amortization and depreciation for the nine months ended september and net cash used in provided by operating activities was billion and million respectively the companys primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans the collection of repayments of these loans and the purchase and sale of securities the companys net cash

billion and billion respectively as a result of a net increase in loans as well as a net increase in investment securities of billion and million respectively net cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by increased deposit levels during the nine months ended september and net deposits increased billion and billion respectively fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the companys need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity and as nonmaturity deposits such as checking and savings account balances are withdrawn additionally the company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits due in part to the fdic limitations on the amount of

that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others a traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid the total amount of dividends which may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank dividends paid by wab to the parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the banks capital to be reduced below applicable
