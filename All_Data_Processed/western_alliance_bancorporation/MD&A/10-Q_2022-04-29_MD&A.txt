by methods other than those prescribed by gaap the companys management uses these nongaap financial measures in their analysis of the companys performance management believes presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the company since the presentation of these nongaap performance measures and their impact differ between companies these nongaap disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap nor are they necessarily comparable to nongaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies preprovision net revenue banking regulations define ppnr as the sum of net interest income and noninterest income less expenses before adjusting for loss provisions management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the company it enables investors and others to assess the companys ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies the following table shows the components of ppnr for the three months ended march and three months ended march in millions net interest income total noninterest income net revenue total

capital adequacy using this same basis specifically the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments in addition management believes that the classified assets to cet1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality as permitted by the regulatory capital rules the company elected to

interestbearing liabilities the decrease in net interest margin of basis points to is largely the result of a decrease in loan yields due to a loan portfolio shift towards residential mortgage loans and higher borrowing costs the decrease to net interest margin was partially offset by higher investment yields compared to the same period in provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and includes amounts related to funded loans unfunded loan commitments and investment securities the provision is equal to

reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions the critical accounting estimates upon which the companys financial condition and results of operations depend and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments are included in the discussion entitled critical accounting policies in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the companys annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december and all amendments thereto as filed with the sec there were no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the annual report on form 10k liquidity liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals fund asset growth and business operations and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the companys business operations or unanticipated events including the ongoing covid19 pandemic the ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors creditors and regulators the companys liquidity represented by cash and amounts due from banks federal funds sold hfs mortgages and nonpledged marketable securities is a result of the companys operating investing and financing activities and related cash flows in order to ensure funds are available when necessary on at least a quarterly basis the company projects the amount of funds that will be required over a twelvemonth period and it also strives to maintain relationships with a diversified customer base liquidity requirements can also be met through shortterm borrowings or the disposition of shortterm assets the following table presents the available and outstanding balances on the companys lines of credit march available balance outstanding balance in

billion in unpledged marketable securities at december the company maintained billion in liquid assets comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents billion in hfs loans and billion of unpledged marketable securities the parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain nonbank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted since deposits are taken by wab and not by the parent parent liquidity is not dependent on the banks deposit balances in the companys analysis of parent liquidity it is assumed that the parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders while continuing to make nondiscretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the parent and affiliated companies under this scenario the amount of time the parent and its nonbank subsidiary can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the parent liquidity analysis management believes the parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over twelve months wab maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in
