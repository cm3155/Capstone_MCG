proud of our thoughtful safe sustainable growth and are excited to have passed the billion asset milestone validating our strategy during the quarter we raised million in an inaugural preferred offering achieving the lowest ever preferred dividend rate for a us bank under billion in assets at in the third quarter exceptional balance sheet expansion continued with our highest ever quarterly loan growth of billion or on a linked quarter annualized basis and deposits rose by billion or annualized as we continue to effectively deploy liquidity loan demand continue to broaden across our business lines with ci loans increasing by billion inclusive of million of ppp runoff along with billion of growth in our residential portfolio notably capital call lines drove billion of growth within ci as deal activity continues to be strong and utilization rates rose additionally resort lending and hotel franchise finance contributed approximately million of loan growth as well as million increase in cre investor western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 for the third quarter wal generated record total net revenues of million a annualized rise in ppnr to million and adjusted eps of adjusted eps quartertoquarter rose by as the company recorded a provision for credit losses totaling million an increase of million from the million provision released in the second quarter we remain one of the most profitable banks in the industry with return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of and respectively which will continue to support capital accumulation and strong capital levels in the quarters to come i would like to reiterate that amerihome is now integrated into the strategic fabric of western alliance and is thoughtfully managed to maximize value for the entire bank through loan deposits and net interest income growth a billion increase in average earning assets drove net interest income growth of million or for the quarter or annualized to million as excess liquidity deployment into loans and loans held for sale contributed significantly to earnings fee income increased million to million and now represents over of total net revenue asset quality continues to remain stable as total nonperforming assets declined to million to basis points of total assets and net chargeoffs were million or basis points finally what excites me most is the diverse set of growth opportunities in front of us we will continue to do what we do best and support our clients in attractive markets nationally where they do business i believe we have exited the pandemic as an employer of choice for leading specialized commercial lenders which positions us well or extremely well to attract and retain uniquely qualified talent to thoughtfully sustain growth with superior risk adjusted returns for example during the quarter we hired two seasoned teams we added people based in texas to our singlefamily home construction cre national business line and brought on the leading national restaurant franchise finance team with the hire of six loan and credit professionals both teams join us from larger commercial banks where they proved their business plans and built robust multibilliondollar books of business the texas cre team has million in outstandings and an additional million approved to be funded and a million pipeline likewise the restaurant franchise finance team has million in outstandings and million approved to be funded and a pipeline of million dale will now take you through the details of our quarterly financial performance dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thank you ken for the quarter western alliance generated record net revenue of million up quarteroverquarter or annualized net interest income grew million during the quarter to million an increase of yearoveryear primarily a result of our significant balance sheet growth and deployment of liquidity into higheryielding assets ppnr rose on an annualized linked quarter basis to million excluding acquisition and restructuring expenses noninterest income increased million to million from the prior quarter as mortgage banking related income rose million for the quarter and totaled million servicing revenue increased million in the quarter as refinance activity slowed despite a smaller servicing portfolio of billion in unpaid principal western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 balance gain on sale margin was basis points for the quarter as we extended the time from funding to sale which positively impacted net interest income with these evolving mortgage sector fundamentals amerihome continues to meet our pro forma acquisition expectations contributing during the quarter which is inclusive of in net interest income from amerihome using our balance sheet an opportunity most standalone correspondent lenders dont have finally adjusted net income for the quarter was million or in adjusted eps which is inclusive of a credit loss provision of million but excludes pretax margin restructuring charges of million turning to net interest drivers during the quarter deployment of our excess liquidity into higheryielding assets drove both loan growth and net interest income growth loans held for sale increased billion and are yielding on a linkedquarter basis yield on loans held for investment declined basis points to which is fully explained by the continued strong growth in low to no life asset categories namely residential loans and capital call lines interestbearing deposits remained relatively stable from the prior quarter at basis points as were total cost of funds at basis points consistent with our previous comments we believe that in the current rate environment funding costs have stabilized net interest income grew million during the quarter to million or yearoveryear as balance sheet growth and optimization of earning asset mix generated robust spread income average earning assets increased billion or during the quarter to billion additionally we successfully deployed liquidity into loans and have held the investment portfolio relatively flat in favor of loans held for sale which we view as a higher yielding cashlike alternative despite our successful liquidity deployment in  we still have meaningful dry powder of billion in cash and the opportunity to further fund loans through continued deposit growth as a result of loan growth in loweryielding categories nim declined basis points to we expect continued strong net interest income growth as were wellpositioned to take advantage of a rising rate environment as of our commercial loan portfolio is variable rate and we have noninterestbearing deposit funding our efficiency ratio improved to from during the quarter while we continue to make investments to support risk management and sustained growth the inherent operating efficiency of deploying excess liquidity has helped push our efficiency ratio to the lower preprovision net revenue increased million or from the prior quarter and from the same period last year this resulted in a ppnr roa of for the quarter an increase of basis points compared to from the last quarter this continued strong performance and leading capital generation provides us significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth support infrastructure and other capital management actions as well as meet credit demands balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased billion or to billion strong deposit growth of billion brought balances to billion at quarterend in all total assets have grown yearoveryear to billion total deposits increased million over the prior quarter to billion primarily due to overnight borrowings of million partially offset by the redemption of million in subordinated debt as tim described we western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 experienced record quarterly loan growth this quarter with growth evenly split between residential and ci loans in all loans grew billion during the quarter and were up billion exppp runoff and over yearover year residential real estate and ci loans grew billion and billion respectively turning to deposits we continue to see broadbased core deposit growth across our business channels deposits grew billion or in the third quarter with the strongest growth in savings and money market accounts of billion noninterest bearing dda accounts contributed million and represents of total deposits strong performance from commercial clients robust fundraising activity in tech and innovation and seasonal inflows in hoa banking relationships were all significant drivers of deposit growth during the quarter we are confident in the stickiness of deposits that weve generated in recent quarters particularly as our newer initiatives are finally taking root our asset quality remained strong and stable special mention loans continue to decline to million or basis points of funded loans total classified assets rose million in the third quarter million or basis points in total assets but are down more than from a year ago on a ratio basis total nonperforming assets declined million to basis points of total assets quarterly credit losses continue to be nominal in the third quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans annualized compared to in the second quarter our loan allowance for credit losses increased million from the prior quarter to million due to robust loan growth in all total loan acl to funded loans is basis points or basis points when excluding ppp loans as mentioned in prior quarters the strategic focus of the bank is to source a significant portion of loan growth from low to no loss segments to achieve a diversified risk a risk diversified portfolio with the third quarter loan growth our low to noloss segments now comprise over half of total loans given our industryleading return on equity and assets we generate sufficient capital to fund about to annual loan growth depending on the mix and this is after dividend service our tangible common equity to total asset ratio of and common equity tier of were way down this quarter by robust asset growth in excess of these levels as youve seen throughout the year we took several capital actions to enhance our capital stat and support ongoing growth during  we issued million of preferred equity which was slightly offset in total capital as we redeemed million of subordinated debt we were also redeeming million of subordinated debt this quarter which we anticipate to be complete in november we will recognize a million pretax non recurring charge associated with this redemption as we accelerate amortization of origination cost on net debt inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment which we increased to our tangible book value per share rose to in the quarter to or growth in the past year our tangible book value per share growth is industryleading and have grown times that of the peers over the past five years or at a compound annual rate of over ill now hand the call back to ken to conclude kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks dale the third quarter really was an exceptional quarter from an earnings and loan growth perspective as our distinctive national business strategy model continues to hit on all cylinders impressively endofperiod loan balances were billion greater than the average balance which provides a strong jumpoff point for the fourth quarter net interest income in addition to the billion in excess liquidity that we are gradually deploying in western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 the coming quarters were very excited about the diverse set of growth opportunities in front of us as we enter the fourth quarter looking forward for fullyear you can expect loan held for investments to continue robust growth with a quarterly minimum of billion to billion an increase from the prior guidance of billion to billion or a low to mid percent growth rate for the year with flexible origination mix designed to maximize net interest income today approximately half of our growth was generated from low to no loss residential mortgages deposits are expected to grow in line with loans as we work to deploy excess liquidity and normalize the loantodeposit ratio which today stands at we expect to maintain our efficiency ratio in the lower as we continue to invest in risk management and technology and work to bring new business lines products and services to market total revenue and ppnr growth will track balance sheet growth as we benefit from operational leverage regarding capital we are targeting a cet1 ratio of which our robust quarterend loan growth impacted we have several mechanisms to address our capital levels most importantly we generate significant capital through earnings growth and have historically demonstrated our success in accessing the capital markets in conclusion we continue to see strong pipelines and have the operating flexibility to both execute on nearterm opportunities while investing for the longterm growth at this time dale tim and i are happy to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just first ken you talked about next year and the lower efficiency ratio i think the one thing that investors wrestle with is just the sustainability of your roaroe give us a sense of like one is this efficiency ratio sustainable especially given your asset size going over billion today and is there anything on the mortgage side that we should worry about that could impact the profitability of the bank over the next year or two kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 okay thanks ebrahim first we think the efficiency ratio in the lower is sustainable for the next couple of years we think our strong net interest income will overpower any expense growth that we have what were doing as a company i think it may be a little bit unique rather compared to our industry peers is not only are we working on 2022s growth but right now were working on 2023s growth and we need to keep the efficiency ratio in the lower so we can bring in new teams as i just discussed launch new products and services to propel us going forward regarding amh and if theres anything that worries us or can impact the growth amh has a number of levers combined being inside of a commercial bank as you heard dale talk about with net interest income growth and so we are still confident about the 2022s eps guidance that we had given when we did the acquisition which is now folded into our overall guidance as we talk about the company dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp ebrahim i appreciate your comment on alluding to the billion as being a hurdle that sometimes is companies with higher levels of risk management expenses but as ken indicated were weve been leading this ahead for years now and so we have already put in place much of that infrastructure that we need and expect that basically on risk management you probably get this economies of scale as you grow but yeah but were prepared for that and thats embedded in our guidance on efficiency ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful dale thanks just because i think the other side of low efficiency is concerns around underinvestment so i think thats helpful and then just separately on the loan growth ken i think you mentioned minimum of to paint us an upside scenario of what could lead that loan growth to being much stronger obviously you are a much larger bank today i would imagine that a much more many more opportunities than you had even months ago so give us a sense of whether you see more upside or downside risk to that loan growth outlook and what could drive that thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay thank you ebrahim let me just add to the last comment the first comment you made that we are very cognizant of underinvesting so were not looking to drive that efficiency ratio below we could if we wanted to but investing for the longterm and having longterm growth aspirations as we do its important that we keep investing which leads us right into your question about my confidence level so i feel very strong about growing between billion to billion if you kind of look backwards you can see that our old guidance of billion to billion we easily passed that or succeeded that but right now as i look forward we have strong demand for subscription and capital call lines theres demand in lot banking hotel and residential construction we believe therell be some new amerihome products that will bring online jumbo loans nonqm loans that will be able to feed our balance sheet as well we see a great deal of activity in the cre incomeproducing space especially with distribution centers weve done a few spec centers and before the show was even lifted those spec centers have been already preleased so we see strong demand there and there are several new businesses that we hope to bring online probably towards the back end of which will give us confidence as we go through the year in looking forward to in terms of our growth momentum so yeah i guess the short answer is im feeling good western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i would also add like to add that after a couple of quarters now weve talked about having to rightsize the loan todeposit ratio obviously if were growing billion to billion on each side of the balance sheet at the same time were not going to move that number we did we made some progress this last quarter where we took it to the higher from the low but we used to be at so i expect as we go through this period and this may largely happen in the residential space but we would have some outsized quarters where loan growth is going to continue either way at that low loan to deposit deployment rate kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp and i just want to add one comment to my statement which is i want to make sure everyone on the line knows that were not chasing loan growth right so of our portfolio today is either in lowloss or noloss credit segments so weve been growing and growing in less riskier assets as weve been posting these numbers ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp you bet dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks operator your next question comes from the line of casey haire with jefferies casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hey casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc another loan growth question for you so this loan growth guide does feel pretty conservative especially with all the runway you have on the resi mortgage side this time next year you guys i think you guys have talked about getting resi loans to about of the loan book is that still kind of your limit and then once you get there is billion to billion a quarter still sustainable and is that especially with all these new businesses that youre looking to add on at the end of western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks casey for your question and thanks for the very eloquent way you called me a sandbagger i appreciate that first if i wasnt clear the billion to billion is our minimum loan growth numbers we actually said that we think were going to post mid25 growth yearoveryear and that would raise that number a little bit higher it may come in a little uneven but we think well get to the mid25 range and to the number we can get there as quickly as we want we would prefer to see it more coming in on the commercial side but we have a very balanced and restrained viewpoint at this moment on the mortgage side but we can turn that on note that i said that amh is turning on just turned on their nonqm and jumbo loan product and thats going to take a little time to ramp up as we get amhs clients comfortable with the program understanding our credit box and our process but that thing should hit full stride somewhere in the middle of next year and that will allow us to step on the accelerator if we want and put on more loan growth really loan growth will be dictated somewhat by deposit growth as dale said weve got plenty of deposit liquidity sitting on our balance sheet with a loan todeposit ratio and also our guide is that we expect deposits to grow along with loans dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i dont think theres a stop sign at a concentration level of residential i mean i think we thats where we would approach the median of the peers and we would we reflect always in terms of what our proportion should be but i could see that number being higher as you know there are some other institutions that are higher than that that seem to be well regarded by the street and as we get there i think were going to have kind of other opportunities and as well as to manage our interest rate risk profile where some institutions have maybe gotten into trouble was too high of a residential concentration as they dont have a funding mix that matches that but with nearly half of our funding in dda it gives us more tolerance for an interest rate risk environment to have something with a longerdated longer maturity on the asset side casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good dale a question for you on the mortgage servicing lines within fees and expenses a positive swing to the tune of about million looking forward is there a way that you can kind of give us a better feel for this as we get used to this business because or should we just kind of expect should expect this volatility to continue dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well honestly for us i will look at it more on a total revenue from amerihome rather than looking at those two lines separately there is a little bit of an interchange between them if you have a more robust view in terms of what valuations of mortgage servicing rights are youre going to have a mortgage servicing right mark that is that could be maybe potentially higher and that gives you more gain on sale but ultimately and were regularly selling these down we have a ready price point to confirm the veracity and the accuracy of that number and by seeing what the gain is in terms of the disposition so one feeds the other and they run off of each other in a fairly short window on our balance sheet and income statement unlike some others western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and just lastly on the capital management front ken im sorry i missed your comments at the end there but you guys are below your kind of level you did not use the atm is the thinking that on a more moderate pace of growth that youll and a plus roe that youll just rebuild organically to get above or are you looking to take actions kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well there are a couple of things there i think this is a highclass problem to have that our growth is coming in so yeah we will go to the market for growth capital we could do that either through the atm or we have some other crt trades that were working on and hopefully well line them up before the end of the fourth quarter our goal is to be just above on a cet1 ratio i think once we get there and if our growth is sort of programmed the way we just described it we wont need to go back many more times to hit the market but if it comes in at an accelerated pace as i said highquality problem to have were happy to issue growth capital to support these earnings casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp all right youre welcome operator our next question comes from the line of brad milsaps with piper sandler brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hey brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co dale curious if you could comment on just kind of where new loan yields are coming on kind of relative to the book yield i dont think you included spot yields in the slide deck this quarter so were just kind of curious kind of where the new loans versus the old were coming on david john chiaverini a analyst wedbush securities inc yeah new loan yields are pretty much on top of slightly lower than what were running off the reason why we had a bps decline and i think i alluded to this but ill give you a little bit more color is because of the mix western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 change we put on north of billion of residential those yields are about billion we put on just short of billion worth of basically capital call lines those yields are pushing billion billion to billion so if we had the both of those in that probably explains the basis point kind of clip there now that said i mean i think residential is going to be a continued part of our growth trajectory and so will we have an additional kind of a slippage in total loan yields in the fourth quarter from the third yeah i believe we will but its not really the spot rates as much as the mix of the loan portfolio thats going to drive that a little bit lower but again were prepared for that and as we did this quarter as well we expect to just kind of plow through that in terms of net interest income performance brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thats helpful and as you guys have reshaped the loan portfolio and will continue to reshape it with more resi how do i think about sort of asset betas if the fed were to in fact start raising rates at some point in the future i know you had the loan floor number in the 10q but just kind of curious how you guys are sort of levered to still the short end obviously a lot of dda but just kind of curious the impact this time around versus last time around since you do have more fixed rate product on the books kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah yeah so i dont know how many were going to get but ill say for the first couple of rate increases youre not going to see much change we do have a number of loans at floors and so those wont change some of the floor and the variable rate are the same number thats a pretty common situation for recent origination activity so those could see an immediate increase but thats the smaller proportion in terms of the loan book so within a range of two to three kind of rate revisions i dont think were going to see much on the asset yield improvement nor are we going to see much in terms of funding costs two reasons on the funding costs one is weve got a very heavy proportion of dda today and two is i just see a lot of liquidity in the system and i see banks kind of struggling to deploy that i dont think youre going to get betas at least out of the gate for the industry as high as theyve been in other rate rising environments because theres just no incentive to increase your funding costs when youre opportunities for deployment remain limited brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great and final question for me you mentioned your decision the hold more the mortgage loans on the books this quarter obviously that helped the average held for sale balance is it your intent to continue to do that obviously market conditions will drive that but have you just kind of scratched the surface on kind of where you think that number can go in terms of adding new products at amh et cetera just wanted to get a sense of that average balance going forward of loans held for sale kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so i this is ken i think the average balance is going to rise its going to rise as you see deposit growth continue we had a billion average balance for  for the heldforsale versus an ending loan balance of billion we see this as an attractive way to generate incremental net interest income these loans earned that was up basis points from the prior quarter and think of these mortgages or think of think of this western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 the heldforsale as a big money market account that has a threeweek turn to it or a threeweek maturity that is government protected so we i mean this is great we love it and this is one of the reasons and as we both dale and i alluded to in our comments that these are the benefits that we get with amh that standalone mortgage providers would not get and thats why we are very excited about doing the acquisition because of all the deposit and loan growth net interest income opportunities that amh offered to us so this is just an example of leveraging amhs loan production onto wals balance sheet and at the end of the day better than investing in basis points after fed thats what we thought thats what was taught to us at ph ps brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co very good kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp in queens if there if there was anyone from new york on the line brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co thanks for the color guys great quarter appreciate it kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning guys thanks for the question i understand the comments about looking in amerihome terms of total revenue basis in terms of the contribution but for the mortgage geeks in the room if you could just kind of talk about the math on the gain on sale how that may fluctuate you alluded to holding the loans longer possibly depressing the gain on sale also just talk about general gain on sale pressure or not that youre seeing in the in the marketplace kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so there is a gain on sale pressure on the margin if you go back to our comments when we acquired amerihome we always kind of planned for more of a gain on sale margin scenario we hoped wed be wrong but its moving towards that direction so what we have in terms of the opportunities in front of us is to increase our win share our win rate which was about this quarter so thats one way to maintain the gain on sale dollar amount again the other thing is were not a slave to the gain on sale income so we can participate or not at our choice somewhat by how much money were bringing in on these mortgages and other opportunities that amh is generating for us so in our big pro forma when we looked at it we assume that were going to get income from the new deposit growth income for held for sale income for held for investment western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 mortgages we put on our balance sheet we assume that we were going to lower their cost of funds we were we assumed that we could go out and crosssell against their client base and sell warehouse lending financing or msr financing so all that was sort of embedded in the big picture in terms of when we did the transaction so we have a number of levers to pull if the margin continues to compress without it jeopardizing our pro formas dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp and youve already started a couple of these so and we talked about this i think last time as well but so before we acquired amerihome they were just in the government products so gse or direct obligations of the federal government and they have now already rolled out their jumbo product thats a new sandbox for them that is also going to give them some ph gos revenue as well as nonqualified mortgages as well so were expanding the their playing field with what theyre doing were expanding the penetration that theyre getting in this group for the number as ken mentioned to something higher moving up from there and then we have a number of other elements like held for sale loans to again address the performance and to soften any volatility in the mortgage market because they can kind of rely on us for liquidity brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc and just to clarify that dale if you had sold straight away would that have resulted in a higher gain on sale that by holding youre just choosing to recognize an nii or some other place dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp no i dont think it would result in a higher ph gos if we had sold immediately what it would have resulted in is less interest income so i mentioned we said they had contribution well of that is basically them using our balance sheet and liquidity to use this held for sale line and hold if you strip that away and a number of banks that are solely in this space that arent owned by a banking company dont really have net interest income thats really not a meaningful component of their revenue sources then their eps is kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp right which represents about of our overall earnings and just for the mortgage geeks out there as you said i just want to emphasize that while amh is a notable piece of our income stream there are other regional and national business lines that produce equal to or greater on the same number so for tech and innovation tech and innovation produces more than amerihome but we tend to spend time talking about a business that has a multiple handle to it when id much rather talk about tech and innovation and the multiple that we have that they get on tech and innovation income so using this as a platform brock to once again tell everyone we are moving away from giving any amh numbers going forward as it relates to eps its just embedded into our numbers as we move forward and were just going to talk about the whole company at the top of the house brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay appreciate the color thank you western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay operator your next question comes from the line of brandon king with truist securities brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc i appreciated the details and commentary on the recent hire that you made and their production volumes so far but wanted to know if you could provide any more insight into your hiring strategy and your plans going forward especially in this environment a lot of other banks say that its tough to find talent these days and theyre competing on compensation and whatnot but just wanted to get more color on that kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah great question and i do think the ability to hire is one of the longest poles in the tent to our strategic plan of objectives so we are finding it a little more difficult to hire just yesterday on our town hall i announced a number of changes which we think are very positive relative to both compensation benefits and flex work schedules we think thats going to help us bring in the people that we need we have in certain cases for the administrators loan closers those types of folks offered hiring bonuses that seemed to have worked and bring people in so thats good so i think we are feeling a little bit of the pinch as some of the other companies are as it relates to opportunities to bring new teams in though we have more people contacting us about coming over to western alliance i think our size of the bank now helps our profile helps of course the numbers that we posted help and its also a very good way when we sit down across the table from a team or several people that we like to bring in and we say the stock did double this year and the equity portion of what they get also is very attractive so were trying to work all the angles here in terms of bringing in people brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay great and then touching on credit so the reserve on a percentage basis declined in the quarter but there was a provision obviously because of the higher balance sheet growth and now its growing at a lower loss loan categories where do you see that loan loss reserve ratio shaking you out at dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 its really hard to say because were in the cecl environment currently expected credit losses well gosh i mean one of the things that was powerful in our ratio declining so quickly is the expectations for collateral value reductions particularly in commercial properties abated dramatically and so right out of the gate in the pandemic everyone thought there was going to be kind of a collateral value collapse no one was ever going to go to the office again and so those estimates by blue chip and moodys and others were fairly dramatic in terms of a swoon that didnt happen and now that it has basically been abated and so here we are with low expectations of collateral value decline and so the number looks pretty good should something result in a change in that environment that would kind of reset that view i think it could and that could put us in a higher expectation of potential risk that said in the todays current environment where things are going its a little bit like i dont know an asymptote in terms of kind of coming down were approaching a limit i dont know exactly where that is but i would expect that over the coming quarters youll see maybe a bleed off of basis points in terms of coverage but provisioning at a slowing rate and how much lower it goes i dont know i mean you could come up with a lot lower number i mean if you say that you look at our most recent performance on chargeoffs were at basis points this quarter annualized thats about where we are for the past year as well and we have a duration of our loan book of four years so if i say i need basis points a year and ive got a cover of four years average life well i only need or call it basis points weve got so in that sense it looks like theres a lot of room to run down further but i certainly wouldnt count on that kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah and we have a little bit of a rate volume thing going on here the volume being dollars we will continue we anticipate continuing to add to the provision but the rate side you will see decline a little bit so thats what were balancing here brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for all the answers kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks operator our next question comes from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning most of my questions have been asked and answered just maybe just two more on the build out or i guess the hire in the franchise finance business i think that the london category has been relatively flat since it was acquired a couple of years ago i guess whats the outlook for that business going forward is it just a bigger balance sheet that is giving you comfort in growing that and i guess how big would you like to see that business get with the new hire in place western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah no thank you for the question well first let me say that the team that we brought over has as its roots ge credit granting experience and they have the same roots that we have in our hotel franchise finance group as well so thats one of the things that attracted us to the team thats one number two the large bank that they came from is stepping away from this sector mostly because we took the team and so the loans sitting on their balance sheet are ripe for the taking and thats why these guys have only been on maybe as i said six weeks eight weeks most they got million outstandings theyve got a very strong pipeline and theyve already been approved for other loans that just need to be taken down by the borrowers so were off to a good start and its very encouraging i would say longer term theres no reason why this business will not look like our resort financing business which has billion of loans its just a question of the timing of how we get there and again everything we do is safe sound and thoughtful credit granting so as long as we see loans that fit our credit box we think the future for this group is very bright timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then on another one of your national verticals theres been some shakeup in the hoa business with a competitor entering that space so i guess in a larger scale what are you seeing from a competitive standpoint there and is there any reason to think that the growth trajectory on deposits indiscernible kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah good question there as well well first let me say that our hoa deposit business is killing it so in they had an alltime record in terms of deposit gathering and brought in million yeartodate they have brought in billion so theyve doubled their production of in only nine months and so were very optimistic about the continued growth in this area both on the deposit side and it gets dwarfed by our balance sheet but were happy with the loan growth that we have there we have a couple hundred million dollars loans that are small or an average size outstanding credit quality and well continue to grow that as we grow the deposits but deposits are this hoa business is a technologydriven business and many people dont realize that and with the upheaval in the market i could think of two or three banks that are coming together or have purchased an hoa business we welcome competition were not frightened of it and our performance todate indicates that well be able to stand up and continue to grow this segment timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks for the call thanks for this kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kwb sic kbw christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning the billion that you referenced with regard to capital call line can you contextualize that a little bit how big is that outstanding right now and then could you also just review the overall mix of the legacy bridge book thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so there are about over billion billion in both subscription and capital call lines we see that as a very opportunistic area for us to continue to grow private equity venture capital funds that are our clients theyre growing their funds and as they grow their funds they need more capital to help enhance their irrs and were dealing with the brand names that you would know that are publicly traded or very very wellknown and we really stepped into this business we were basically silent on this business two years ago and so weve kind of stepped into it and we like the growth prospects there in terms of ill say tech and innovation overall yeartodate tech and innovation overall has seen loan growth stay rather flat and thats because with all the liquidity in the vc ecosystem a lot of our loans are getting paid down but as i said on our town hall meeting yesterday about the tech and innovation group when they get lemons they make lemonade and the lemonade that theyre making is really on the tech and innovation side in terms of growing deposits so theyre having just an outstanding year in tech and innovation deposit gathering theyre up over million so again that helps us fuel other opportunities we have other places on the balance sheet to grow loans christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc was there something thanks for that color was there something in this quarter from the billion and to get to billion i mean thats just quite remarkable in one quarter is there anything specific to this quarter that i know that the growth has been tremendous for the industry but basically a doubling kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah first let me say it surprised us as well as they grew that quickly we had been doing we had granted a number of approved a number of subscription lines accounts dating back bigger ones in size  of and also the first quarter and second quarter of this year and they just started to get pulled down utilization runs around or thereabouts and our clients are pulling it down and were happy that they are christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great if i could just sneak one more in the heldforsale conversation about that growing kind of over the near term if we took a little bit of a longer view and looked out maybe a couple of years in a higher rate environment how would you see this strategy at all maybe not the balances be affected dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 i think its going to top out im not exactly sure at what level or when that is but as we continue to see economic recovery we see broadening demand across other sectors a number of which have higher yield we think that this is an accordion i mean its really to us its almost like a parking in the securities book except its rate sensitive and you can get the money out in three weeks i mean these are very short kind of rolls so its an alternative to that it certainly yields better and so weve got excess liquidity with the enormous deposit growth weve had this year were parking it there as an alternative but we can pull that down quickly i think that over time we will i mean as we move our loantodeposit ratio back up to or wherever it might be i think some of that giveup is going to be from here i might also say that some of that giveup is going to come from the securities book we ran up our securities book hard in and early because we didnt have this alternative we have i would say underutilized deployment in there where we bought rmbs and we can buy rmbs they yield a lot less or we can buy governmentguaranteed puts to the gses basically the same kind of credit risk and make another basis points christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so the securities book is flat to down from here dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks dale dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp good morning western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc one question i think a lot of the pl stuff has been beat up pretty well but one question i had is the commercial segment and the consumer segment had roughly equal growth and it looks like your earnings are roughly equal do you think about the business that way do you want a balanced business model or do you expect one segment to outgrow the other over time kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so we meet well on a weekly basis with our senior operating committee and every week we talk about whats happening in every market and whats happening with all the products and its at that meeting and also at our senior loan committee meetings where we allocate capital and liquidity as appropriate so thats what drives us is where is the best riskadjusted returns and thats what we push on we dont really come out and say consumer versus commercial lines need to be balanced jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay good dale theres been a lot of questions on the burning asset mix and you used the term optimizing the earning asset mix of all the things that youve talked about if you had to point to one or two that we can expect to see in the next quarter or two what would they be dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well i think probably youre going to see kind of a continuation of what weve got so far i would hope that were going to continue to see broadening out of our loan development and production alternatives and but at the same time weve got so much room and so much liquidity to kind of finally flare i might say so that could mitigate what wed be doing on say loans held for sale as we just discussed or your other factors but if weve got strong loan growth i think weve got opportunities to kind of continue to and maybe trade away i mean capital call lines we love them we think theyre bulletproof in terms of structure but theyre obviously not the highest yielding thing we have and they also consume a little bit more in terms of riskweighted assets at kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay good on the noninterest income line just to kind of put that to bed i think the message youre sending is dont expect it to grow at the same pace as net interest income but itll show up somewhere in the pl and it may bounce around a little bit but dont necessarily expect fees to keep pace with nii is that fair dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i think thats fair western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay and then just one question for you ken on eps i actually had to look up asymptote to remind me what that meant and so im going to ask you a simple question on the eps that you put up for the quarter anything in there that you think is unsustainable even if i put whats the number billion of loan growth and i think its too low anything thats unsustainable in the kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well first that was dale showing off indiscernible and we wish him all the best on the really there was nothing there thats unusual that i would remove that would lower eps i think thats a fairly good base to use and then i see where youre going take the incremental jumpoff on the ending loan balance to the average loan balance of billion make some assumptions on how we deploy cash and take your  to  earnings or move them in that direction jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc sure dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i mean if you look at the third quarter i mean we have a spectacular operating leverage on a linkedquarter basis i think expenses were up of the amount of revenue that trend is not obviously sustainable but consistent with our guide that we should be in the lower so from here i dont think that theres anything that you really have to pull back from jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of david chiaverini with wedbush david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hey thanks i have a follow up on the size of the held for sale portfolio you mentioned about it rising with deposits but when i look at the periodend balance versus the average its lower and i would assume that and i may be stating the obvious here but it would be a function of mortgage origination levels so for instance over the summer months when youre originating say billion if we go into the winter months and youre originating billion and youre holding these loans for three weeks i imagine that those held on the balance sheet would be lower through the winter but can you talk about that a little bit dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah actually its more kind of liquidity balancing for us i appreciate your comment and it is based on kind of originations but these are sold in short forwards to the gses for delivery and we just extended that a little bit western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2021 what we do though is we extend those a little bit more so that they come due in the middle of the month rather than at the end if you have the kind of if you saw our daily balance sheet you can kind of infer this from what youve seen before we tend to run up on loans toward the end of a month and toward the end of a quarter so theres a little bit of trough in the middle and you see this on our loan book which has for the quarter north of billion lower average than the ending and so now were in this period of flatlining where our loan growth so far has gone up a little but not a lot in the fourth quarter thats pretty typical and then kicks in as we could go later in the year so what weve done is we run up the heldforsale book early on in the quarter it gets you to a higher average and then when the loan book spikes at quarterend we drive the heldforsale balance down david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc got it very helpful and then you mentioned about the gainonsale margin youre expecting it to approach the level can you remind us what that margin was in dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp it was on the high in david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great and then shifting to that new team in texas the singlefamily home construction cre national business line you sized the restaurant franchise finance and that could get to billion can you give us a sense of how big you expect this team in this portfolio to grow kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp im having a little trouble giving you that number because there are several factors that come into play housing permits the churn and all that but we wouldnt have gone into this area and hired this team unless we thought that over time we could get to about the same level as the food franchise group i just dont know how quickly theyre going to get there but theyve got a very strong pipeline were very active in terms of helping them and flying down there and working with them and their client base so a lot of optimism around it but i would say i think you should use the same billion dollar number for the food franchise david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks very much operator and this concludes the questionandanswer portion of our call i will now turn the call back over to mr ken vecchione for closing remarks kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings
