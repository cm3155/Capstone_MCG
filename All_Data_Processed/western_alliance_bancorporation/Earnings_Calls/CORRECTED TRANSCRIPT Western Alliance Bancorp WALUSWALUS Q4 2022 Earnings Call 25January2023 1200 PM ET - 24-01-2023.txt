morning everyone id like to provide an overview of our performance and then preface our approach to before dale reviews the banks financial performance i should also mention that tim bruckner our chief credit officer is also in the room with us today western alliance had a strong year in our diversified national commercial bank group loans deposits by nearly and posted record net revenue and net income growth of and respectively we accomplished all this while maintaining strong and stable asset quality as net chargeoffs to average loans were approximately for the year while nonperforming assets to total assets improved to basis points balance sheet is wellpositioned to weather an evolving environment as of the loan portfolio is creditprotected and of the loans can be classified as insured or economicallyresistant our goal is to emerge from this slowing or recessionary environment as a topperforming asset quality bank in our peer group a position we currently occupy for the higher interest rate environment and slowing economy will generate headwinds for the banking industry as i mentioned on our  earnings call wal is focused on bolstering cet1 levels restraining loan originations with deposit growth outpacing loan growth while maintaining leading asset quality and growing year overyear earnings we are pleased with the substantial progress made towards this goal our cet1 ratio ended the year at which was over basis points higher than the previous quarter western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 the rising capital was driven by purposefully reducing approximately billion in certain lowmargin low deposit categories such as capital called and subscription lines and corporate finance syndications without these actions quarterly held for investment loans would have grown billion and generated incremental interest income our ongoing investments in diversified deposit businesses should provide liquidity for excess on loan growth  ending deposits declined billion from last quarter while average deposits declined by only million quarteroverquarter this decline was primarily driven by shortterm seasonal tax and insurance escrow deposit outflows from the mortgage warehouse group which has since recovered with  quartertodate average deposit balances up more than billion from year end previous investments in our settlement services business escrow and hoa deposit businesses as well as the soon to be launched corporate trust platform combined with several other initiatives we look to allow provide meaningful opportunities to gather incremental deposits this year we look for predictable balance sheet growth to improve nim and grow net interest income in after dales comment i will discuss our outlook in more detail dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks ken for the year western alliance produced record net revenues of billion net income over billion and eps of 14th consecutive year of rising earnings we maintained interestleading performance with return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of and respectively grew tangible book value per share to higher yearoveryear ken mentioned we previously identified a nearterm priority of bolstering our key capital ratios were pleased with the substantial progress made toward this goal with our cet1 ratio increasing over basis points to in  this strategy led us to proactively restrain balance sheet growth without inhibiting record net interest income and earnings for the year net interest income increased to billion our diversified deposit franchises are focused on generating attractive core funding that drives net interest income and eps higher presently purely minimizing deposit basis to maximize the interest margin noninterest income declined million to million as a result of ongoing softness in the mortgage industry however improved mortgagerelated revenue in  and the pending withdrawal of a large money center bank from the corresponding mortgage business suggests gain on sale margins and core servicing income could be in the very early stages of stabilizing finally asset quality remains stable and strong and classified and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets are still lower than prepandemic levels all this dramatically transforms this business over the last decade to become a national commercial bank focused on deep segment expertise underwriting specialization and greater business diversification for the year western alliance recorded net chargeoffs of just million or less than basis points of average loans turning to fourth quarter trends and business drivers western alliance generated net income of million eps of and preprovision net revenue of million operating eps was or for all of total net revenue was million an increase of million during the quarter or yearoveryear net interest income increased from  to million was primarily driven by nim expansion but also benefited from higher average earning asset balances during the quarter the company completed a creditlinked note transaction bringing issuances to total million western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 as of yearend the company is protected from first credit losses on referenced pools of loans totaling billion overall noninterest income remained essentially flat from the prior quarter at million as mortgage banking related revenue increased million to approximately million increase was partially offset by a million marktomarket charge included in other income noninterest expense included increased or million resulting in efficiency ratio of approximately primarily due to higher deposit costs related to earnings credits the addition to ratio was adjusted to classify deposit costs as interest expense the thats remaining operating expenses were essentially flat turning now to net interest drivers our assetsensitive balance sheet benefited from the rising rate environment the risk investment yields increased basis points from the prior quarter to as variable rate securities reprice higher on a linkedquarter basis loan yields increased basis points to with and endofquarter spot rate of loans held for sale benefited from rising mortgage rates an increase basis points to irrespective of the federal reserves rate trajectory our net interest income will continue to benefit from an average of billion of loans maturing or repricing higher each quarter in wherein fixed rate loans are being replaced by these loans that yield over higher while variable rate loans are repricing in a spread basis points wider on average full funding costs including borrowings and deposits increased basis points to as the use of cds and shortterm borrowings increased as a proportion of average interestbearing liabilities net interest income growth of million or on a linkedquarter basis was powered by a 20basispoint nim expansion and a modest increase in average interestearning assets the increase in total interest income continues to be greater than the change in total funding costs including ecr expenses demonstrating our continued asset sensitivity the rate shock analysis shows that with a plus basis points shock on a static balance sheet net interest income is expected to lift over using the same scenario on a gross balance sheet we would expect net interest income to grow over soon the rates decline as some were projecting that might happen later this year the growth balance sheet net interest income still rises coincident with our decreasing asset sensitivity profile our efficiency ratio increased basis points to approximately after reclassifying deposit costs as interest expense adjusted efficiency was essentially flat and again demonstrating the high operating leverage of the company deposit costs increased million from the prior quarter due to higher earnings credit rates on deposits but at a slower rate than  as earnings credit rate paying demand deposits declined preprovision net revenue climbed to a record million or increase yearoveryear resulted in return on average tangible common equity excluding all other comprehensive income is for the quarter or basis points higher than last quarter western alliances leading organic capital generation and continued strong performance provides significant flexibility to fund balance sheet growth build capital ratios and meet credit demands hotel for investment decreased million to billion and deposits declined billion to billion at yearend primarily driven by shortterm seasonal mortgage warehouse factors total borrowings fell million over the prior quarter primarily from a decline in shortterm borrowings offset by issuance of million in credit linked notes on a reference pool of residential loans western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 finally intangible book value per share increased or over the prior quarter and audio gap yearoveryear to with a small organic earnings along with reduced drag fromavailableforsale securities margin recorded in aoci audio gap quarter net loan growth is impacted by our purposeful decision to temper certain ci loan categories as equity fund resources and to a lesser extent corporate finance by approximately billion in total excluding these reductions ci loans would have grown million with total loans held for investment growth of billion on a linkedquarter basis audio gap ci growth was driven by million from sponsorbacked commercial real estate million from construction and million from residential additionally the breadth of our business lines generated healthy loan demand in regional banking which was million higher than  hotel franchise finance rose million and tech and innovation was up million we are well wellpositioned to maintain prudent growth in a more uncertain economic environment given our diversified loan mix between national business lines residential real estate and regional banking over the last three years of our robust loan growth has come from low to noloss categories which now account for of our entire portfolio furthermore we have structured additional loss prevention as of loans are credit protected which should fortify our industryleading asset quality turning to deposits competition for funding picks up during the quarter and larger than expected seasonal factors combined to temporarily reduce deposit balances early deposits declined billion primarily driven by short term seasonal escrow deposit outflows in our mortgage warehouse group which are included in noninterest bearing deposits but subject to earnings credit rates ken mentioned these seasonal factors have reversed since year end with mortgage warehouse  quartertodate average balances already at more than billion from year end or higher from the same period yearoveryear additionally quartertodate average balances for total deposits are up more than billion from and approximately million greater than s average balance mortgage warehouse comprised to the reduction in noninterestbearing dda endofyear seasonality is evident in the linkedquarter decline an average deposits of only million versus the more pronounced decline on a periodend basis increased competition for liquidity in a higher rate environment drove an increase in total interestbearing deposits including a billion growth in cds interestbearing demand deposits were billion from last quarter in part for migration from noninterestbearing dda diversified deposit franchise continues to provide meaningful opportunities to generate attractive funding to support loan growth among our scalable national business lines were pleased with the continuing momentum in settlement services and homeowners associations it produced linkedquarter growth of million and nearly million respectively going forward we expect continued growth for our deposit business lines including business escrow services to continue to generate attractive deposits fund ongoing balance sheet growth and soften the impact of elevated rates on overall funding costs our asset quality remains strong and stable classified assets and nonperforming assets as a percentage of the total are still lower than prepandemic levels total classified assets increased million in  to basis points from total assets only basis points higher than  total nonperforming assets to total assets were down basis point from last quarter to the prospects for greater economic volatility continue to evolve we believe our underwriting discipline borne out of our national business line strategies has prepared us well for additional credit stress and the accompanying greater macro headwinds however we have not observed any preliminary signs of material uptick in credit western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 migration trends and we also expect to steadily reduce our exposure to the more sensitive loan category this year sound asset quality decisions will dictate our thoughtful loan growth trajectory and enable us to maintain profitability despite heightened economic uncertainty early net chargeoffs of million in the quarter or basis point of average loans of the fullyear net chargeoffs to million those quarterly chargeoffs had been stable at approximately million per quarter for the past year while net chargeoff variances result from volatility and recoveries operation expense for credit losses was million primarily due to uncertainties surrounding indiscernible recession offset by riskweighted asset optimization efforts sale of corporate finance syndications and reducing capital call and subscription line exposure base case for a mild recession was the allowance for credit losses assumptions weighted toward the moodys concensus forecast which has shifted toward increasing the indiscernible more conservative scenario total loan acl to funded loans was basis points while our acl to nonaccrual loans was at yearend adjusting for the million of loans covered by creditlinked notes where ample first loss coverage is assumed by a third party the acl coverage rises to basis points we believe these superior asset quality trends are sustainable throughout economic cycles through the western alliances deliberate postgfc business transformation strategy going back to that time period nearly of losses western alliance incurred during the great financial crisis came from loan categories comprising of the audio gap loan portfolio in those categories make up less than of total loans in contrast of the current portfolio was insured audio gap in resilient categories the insured category consists of credit protected government guarantees and cash secured loans resistant loans are categories at historically low or no loan losses these categories have experienced de minimis losses since resilient loans are supported by strong collateral and counterparties as well as our underwriting expertise while this category might experience some great migration realized losses are minimal due to limited recovery and uncovered collateral risk with average losses at only basis points and a maximum quarterly annualized loss of just basis points of the portfolio we grew is more sensitive to economic growth our lending in this category has been focused on unique subsegments that offer the highest riskadjusted returns and where we leverage our sector knowledge and underwriting capabilities to maintain superior relative asset quality since these loans have experienced a maximum quarterly annualized loss rate of only basis points with average losses of basis points exceptional postgfc asset quality has been highlighted by minimal net chargeoffs of only million since the beginning of comparing our performance to the publiclyheld banks with assets between billion and billion based on the united states we realized the lowest average net chargeoffs and the lowest quarterly annualized maximum chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans over the same time period while the past decade has been a period of relatively low credit stress our leading performance in low average losses and more importantly the lowest loss volatility among peers bodes well as to how western alliance will outperform peers if and when credit stress becomes more acute on our last earnings call we discussed our renewed focus to rebuild capital and have made strong progress so far our tangible common equity and total assets ratio of common equity tier of were both materially higher quarteroverquarter in our industryleading return on equity and assets we continue to western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 generate significant capital to fund organic growth and to lift wellcapitalized regulatory ratios the strong capital generation during this quarter is the equivalent of issuing approximately million shares as previously mentioned tbv per share increased to and since has grown times faster than the peer group we believe our business diversification excellent asset quality and ability to generate solid operating leverage will continue in the softer economy and validate our franchise as a highperforming all weather growth bank back to ken kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks dale i was pleased with the management teams ability to adapt to the changing interest rate and economic environment to produce record operating results in our thoughtful balance sheet growth in conjunction with executional focus positioned the bank to capitalize on net interest income sensitivity while simultaneously growing both sides of the balance sheet with industryleading performance asset quality remained solid and stable with no signs of elevated stress looking forward for the full year of we expect a continued careful balance sheet growth driven by our diversified business model with a flexible origination mix designed to maximize net interest income we expect loans held for investment to grow between and and deposits to grow between and our specialized deposit franchises generate funds for more economically agnostic and secularly strong sectors with often significant deposit growth opportunities in excess of loan growth we also expect improved interest expense on the marginal deposits raised as we had fewer term deposits in favor of our hit interestbearing deposits net interest margin is expected to expand between and as it moves in concert with fed fund actions favorable earning asset repricing dynamics for the quarter will support nim even if the fed pauses hikes this year net interest income is expected to grow between and for the year in a rising rate environment and to exceed growth in ecrrelated deposit costs thus the efficiency ratio for the year should remain in the low as we will continue to invest in risk management technology and new business lines to take advantage of the attractive growth opportunities we see in front of us in aggregate we expect preprovision net revenue growth of to excellent asset quality should remain intact but we could return to more normalized losses if the economy enters into a recession our goal remains to prudently bolster key capital ratios in line with macro environment with a cet1 ratio of between and our banks industryleading return on average tangible common equity produces significant organic capital of approximately basis points of cet1 net of dividends per quarter this provides us with significant flexibility to achieve our strategic objectives grow capital ratios onbalancesheet growth or undertake other capital actions this time dale tim and i are happy to take your questions western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 question and answer section operator we will now begin the qa session operator instructions the first question comes from the line of casey haire with jefferies please proceed casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys no way i caught all that guide ken but i did hear the nim guide i think you said to im assuming thats for the year can you just give us sort of the progression how you see it trending throughout the year and exiting the year and what fed forecast are you guys assuming thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so on the fed forecast we actually have only one rate increase at the beginning of the year thats in about a week from now for basis points on the upside we also have two rate decreases both basis points placed into our  forecast were probably less confident about those rate declines but we think its a good prudent thing to do in order to manage our efficiency ratio and not have expenses run ahead of potential revenue increases so thats the rate forecast on nim we expect it to grow slowly through the year between and its pretty tight for us so probably crosses over a little more towards the end of  into  and then just grows generally from there casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay and within that deposit growth guide which i think you said to any sense im assuming theres a lot of negative mixed shift baked into that but any sense of where dda as a percentage of total deposits can settle versus that i think were low today kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp ill sort of let dale answer that second half of the question but deposit rises between and thats billion to billion right and just to be clear what were trying to do is grow deposits at a rate faster than loan growth and thats what we mentioned on  in terms of growth areas for us in terms of businesses that may give you some confidence around the deposits our hoa business in grew billion and we kind of see that still being the same we also see growth coming from our settlement services and our business escrow services lines of business and those we invested in in and with a stronger rollout as we got into and those businesses did rather well certainly settlement services did rather well in and then the rest is in terms of deposit growth will come from the regions dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah as you know casey its pretty difficult in todays environment to garner new noninterest bearing deposit relationships but as we indicated we have seen a recovery of approximately half of the dda declines in the fourth quarter primarily related to mortgage banking operations and the seasonal trough is so im going to western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 stick with that that we think we can all about half of what came down in the fourth quarter but again what were focused on from here is how do we sustaining our deposit growth trajectory and then putting on loans that have plus or more spread between them and that can drive net interest income kind of regardless of what the fed does casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just kind of tying this all together you guys talked about the number this year you got there the street has you at for do you feel like i can input all the components and work it through but im just wondering do you feel like that is doable with this guide kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so casey what id say is our ppnr guide is between and and from there you have to take a viewpoint on what you thinks going to happen in the economy in terms of determining the provision so the provision will naturally grow because of balance sheet growth were not seeing any cracks in asset quality it looks pretty good but listening to a number of the talking heads many people think towards the back half of well see some weakening in asset quality again we havent seen any of that so youre going to need to make your own assumptions regarding chargeoffs on top of provisioning but the ppnr guide is between and the next year casey haire q analyst jefferies llc understood and last one for me just the loan deposit growth is that average or periodend kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so we factor by kind of both of those numbers but from here i expect this to recover about half of the dda decline in the fourth quarter by period end casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you operator thank you the next question comes from the line of brad milsaps with piper sandler please proceed brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good afternoon hey thanks thanks for taking my questions appreciate all the color around guidance maybe i wanted to maybe delve into credit a little bit more dale you gave a lot of color but just kind of curious with everything thats going on all the uncertainty just can you talk a little bit more about what were the drivers of the million provision this quarter western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 i understand that a lot of movement within the riskweighted assets you didnt have a lot of loan growth but it would just seem that most outlooks have worsened in the million provision it might seem a little light maybe relative to the environment but just wanted to get some more color there particularly maybe as it relates to kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so lets start with if you work backwards from the million and add on to that the sale of the corporate finance syndications which we sold plus the fact that this is a quarter where we didnt grow and we took down our efr balances when you kind of reverse engineer it we would have been closer to what weve posted in previous quarters so the million really represents none of those actions dale do you want to talk about the cecl stuff dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so we subscribed to kind of the moodys kind of performance and that has as we indicated kind of gradually deteriorated like i said were not seeing that for us the most significant variable is really what happens on the commercial real estate metric i think for most banks this probably has to do with unemployment and when you look at where they are projecting a decline on the consensus and then we also consider s4 those levels are still kind of well above what our advanced rates are on commercial real estate transactions and so while they pick up a little bit in terms of loss its not as dramatic as maybe some other institutions might realize brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great and as you think about areas that you want to grow in in terms of the loan portfolio would those be areas in your mind i mean you mentioned we need to grow in less risky areas maybe areas that have more risk would have maybe more variable rate loans just kind of curious how to think about the areas that you want to grow in visàvis kind of how that might impact provisioning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so ill say our loan pipeline still remains active i would see us growing a little more in note financing buildto rent multifamily looks strong as well as industrial youll see some pickup from construction loans that we did in previous quarters that are beginning to fund up and hotel financing will be active as we look going forward specific residential could be interesting what we dont want to do is get in front of a fed action and kind of decreased asset sensitivity until theres more clarity in terms of where rates are headed but i do believe that mortgage rates that begin with a is probably going to be is going to work out over time brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thanks guys ill hop back in queue operator thank you the next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody i wanted to start on the deposit side in terms of the deposit growth the to could you talk more about how you see the mix evolving through the year and particularly im curious how much of the growth do you plan on getting from ecr deposits time deposits its obviously a fairly aggressive deposit growth guide dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so like we said i mean in terms of actual kind of core noninterestbearing dda if we can hold that flat i think that would be a win and i think the large preponderance is going to be in interestbearing money market accounts and those come in different varieties in terms of spreads that we offer depending on the relationship and whether theres credit tied to it as well i do think that the cd side is probably going to increase a bit more than it has but probably to a lesser at a lower rate than what weve grown recently and then interestbearing checking is where i think is also going to be kind of a strong growth area much of our hoa deposits kind of flows into that category at this point in time so at the end the dda i think youre going to see is still going to probably diminish as a proportion of total the growth there is going to be an ecrrelated big chunk in the money market accounts and a little bit more in cds steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it so dale if we follow that through interestbearing deposit costs were million this quarter where do you see that moving to by in terms of what you need to get in terms of this nim being stable to up a bit what are you assuming deposit cost rise through interestbearing dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so i mean it really depends a bit on your rate forecast but what we see is that interestbearing deposit costs right now and if i could throw deposit costs in there from ecr we grew during the fourth quarter net interest income was up about million if i add the interest expense plus the ecr charges gave up about three quarters of that i think that that range is probably going to be more or less be intact so i think were going to incrementally improve net interest income including ecr debits against it but at a diminished rate than what we saw the past couple of quarters steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay when i look at where some of your peer regional banks have come out this quarter in terms of what theyre paying on deposits many of them have barely budged on some of these categories curious whats the conversation you have with prospects and is this just a massive opportunity for you to bring over new households businesses and do you see this as more of a consumer or business opportunity thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well were a commercial bank so we dont have much in the way of consumer deposits and so our deposits are going to be floating at the marginal higher end of interest expense but we focus on net interest income and we western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 have the ability to take those deposits and put them in beta loans and hence make the spread on it and so thats been in the conversation were seeing larger clients move some of their money to us and having conversations about moving money to us we like that and whats really a little bit different for us in terms of how we approach business when we started the change somewhere in the middle of  of last year is we used to lead with loans and now we lead with deposit conversation and were very clear that therell be no credit extended unless theres a very strong deposit relationship and that conversation has been wellreceived by our client base steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions operator thank you the next question is from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning i guess a few final questions maybe one not sure if you already mentioned this apologies just on the expense outlook as we think about core expenses just remind us in terms of the growth rate youre thinking about as part of your ppnr guidance and also the one key seasonality that we should be thinking about kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp sorry i didnt hear that last point whats the one thing we should be thinking about i didnt hear that part ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch the first quarter seasonality like im assuming like first quarter historically is marked the highwater mark for the efficiency so im just wondering if there should be a seasonal lift in expenses that we should be baking in kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so ill take the second part of that first the answer is yes our expenses tend to pop up a little bit more in  but overall our efficiency ratio were targeting is in the low which weve always targeted and we have one of the leading efficiency ratios in the industry we kind of feel that thats the right place to be it allows us to continue to make the appropriate investments in the bank on both risk management and technology as we continue to get bigger and bigger but it also allows us to invest in new products and new businesses and for the last several years weve been investing as i said in settlement services in business escrow services weve got a new initiative we just recently launched in deposits that were not ready yet to talk about but we built last year thats off to a good strong start so keeping the efficiency ratio in the low allows us to generate the operating leverage we want also invest money today for future performance western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and what does that imply just in terms of how we think about just the expense growth for the year is it highsingle digits dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so its going to be highsingle digits might be lowdouble if you look at the kind of the ppnr element million to million holding the efficiency ratio basically flat as to where we are could provide for a little more room but what were going to do is were watching this closely i mean and so as things we authorize fte as we continue to demonstrate performance on growth of the balance sheet were going to have revenue feed our expense expansion kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp i want to make sure were not talking across each other so my commentary was on the adjusted efficiency ratio without deposit cost because dale just talked about that putting it towards net interest income so on the adjusted efficiency ratio without the rising deposit costs thats what we think will be in the low ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch noted and just go ahead yeah and i guess maybe a separate question going back to credit and i understand the macro uncertainty but when you look at your ppnr guidance that youve given even assuming provisions midyear would imply earnings at about im just wondering is there anything around the loan book that causes that hesitation when you think about eps outlook for this year relative to your guidance and obviously youve expressed comfort with the asset quality of the book so im just wondering why you what would be the scenario in which that eps plus or minus would not be achievable kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so as you know how cecl works it really comes down to the end of the year and then the outlook into so if moodys should turn more bearish as we put on loans youre increasing your provision for the life of that loan not for the risk thats in the book and so thats why weve been a little bit more reticent on floating where we think eps numbers are and then stay more on the ppnr side those are the things that we can control on asset quality again were not seeing any issues at this moment i would point you to a little bit the last two slides in the presentation where we think weve been able to grow loan growth in a very prudent way and keep our chargeoffs down and i would remind you that of the book is in either insured or resilient or resistant categories ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and if i may one just followup when we think about the loan growth to for this year a lot of macro uncertainty like should we be worried in terms of the quality of loans that youre putting on the balance western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 sheet right now at this point in the cycle like what or just from a client selection standpoint is there a risk of adverse selection kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp no so were not going to grow for growths sake all right so the asset quality is still incredibly important right in my opening comments one of the things i want to get rid of is any connection to the gfc that and and i want no connection to that and we are a completely different company so we want to grow above trend yet at the same time we want to have abovetrend asset quality or bestinclass asset quality were working on doing both so were not going to sacrifice the asset quality for higher loan growth having said that after going through our reviews we think the range that we gave of to allows us to grow the loan book without growing into a recession and also protect or can remain with stable and strong asset quality dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp we will pivot as necessary as new facts and situations emerge i mean we did this during the pandemic one of the few banks to sustain a growth trajectory during that point of time and where do we go we werent sure how is it two years or is it four years to a vaccine so we need to capital call and when low ltv residential never lost a dime on either of those and so were going to be nimble about using the flexibility of our business model to sustain earnings performance improvement over time ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you for taking my questions operator thank you the next question comes from the line of brandon king with truist please proceed brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey i wanted to touch on loan yields i know ken you mentioned last quarter and seeing the loan committee turned down loans initially and getting better pricing so wanted to get a sense of what the outlook was for loan spreads going into this year and if youre still getting the same reception from clients kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp ill give you another story to that too so our loan yields are holding in from that last conversation we had when we did our  earnings dale mentioned spreads are up about on average basis points and were not getting a lot of pushback on pricing i dont have any numbers for you but i can tell you when we say no to a loan that has good asset quality and good pricing we usually are saying no because its not generating the deposits that we want to accompany that loan and what were seeing is when we turn down those loans those loans have been returning to the senior loan committee now with greater deposits and so what were encouraged about is that the pricing is holding and our determination to see more deposits accompany the loans has been following through from our credit committee western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thats helpful and then as far as the riskweighted asset optimization is that process complete or theres still some work to do going into this year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp tim why dont you take a shot at that one because been running the process timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp yeah thanks ken that is ongoing its definitely a part of our culture so something that well continue to do theres definitely remaining benefit to be achieved through optimization some of thats in the targeted growth portfolio mix and some of it is structural with our clients but ongoing improvements still expected thank you brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it got it and then just lastly on the mortgage warehouse deposits understand the seasonality in the fourth quarter and this came back in this quartertodate but should we expect a similar kind of magnitude as far as seasonality in the fourth quarter by this year and going forward kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well its more pronounced in the fourth quarter of than weve ever seen before and i think some of the reasons for that are so we have some of our accounts relate to taxes and insurance and others are principal insurance so the accident insurance we expected a decline largely because of california property taxes are due in the pi payments tend to have much more interim month ebb and flow but not so much kind of seasonal elements and that changed a bit this time so from our view i think there were very few refinancings and almost very few sales of residential real estate that took place in december and so as a result of that when somebody pays off lets say somebody pays off the loan or refinance say the 5th of december what will show up for us is well get a deposit including that principal of that loan and that is remitted to one of the gses two weeks later well that didnt happen and so i do think that you can make your own projection about what december of is going to look like but the dirt of activity in the month of december which i dont see a seasonal trough anyway but it was certainly more significant than usual and that contributed to this and that seems to be turning even now okay early turn in terms of kind of the spring buying and selling season im not sure brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions operator thank you the next question comes from the line of andrew terrell with stephens please proceed western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good morning looking at the capital call loans around billion this quarter is that the pace of runoff we should expect out of the book over the next couple of quarters and i know there are some associated clns against the portfolio i guess do those securities remain in place as the capital call portfolio comes down or would the clns fall commensurate with the reference pull timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp hey tim bruckner again ill take the first part of your question on the portfolio runoff answer is no thats not to be expected that was driven by a handful of large transactions we elected to exit for return reasons as we move into the coming quarters we wont see similar dollar amounts of runoff at all kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah we do have a cln on the i appreciate you remembering that on the capital call and subscription lines that cln as opposed to the residential ones which are closed so its a specific pool of loans and as those loans pay off or whatever thats done and the cln runs down this one is a it has substitution ability so it lasts for three years so we have the ability to when something comes out of that we can put something else in it that cln is a fraction of our total capital call and subscription line so it doesnt really have much of an effect there it was really done for as tim indicated for return purposes not so much for capital management because weve already taken a portion of those down to through that process andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay got it and then dale do you have what the msr valuation change was this quarter and then any thoughts on just run rate for mortgage servicing and then gainonsale income dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah we had no change in the valuation of the msr in  and so what that means is that they hedging basically very materially completely offset what was taking place in terms of market rate so there wasnt any valuation adjustment that had happened kind of going forward i think there may be is going to be some msr dispositions that take place and so is that going to have an effect on the market but at the same time i think theres a little more stability in terms of what people expect around refinance behavior and so that could kind of extend the lives and the confidence in terms of what those servicing rights are worth kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp i would add as you look quartertoquarter i would think about the total mortgage income being relatively flat to  i think that was your specific question and while too early to call a trend i would say that the first or so days into january we are encouraged by margins rising in the business as that large money center bank as does the correspondent lending market and so weve got our fingers crossed that that continues to move forward but at this point so thats positive thats emerging opportunity we think but right now id keep q1s mortgage income relatively flat to q4s western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay got it and then if i could just sneak one in on the last point just the competitive dynamics in the correspondent business perhaps that does create some tailwind to the gainonsale margin but does the exit of a larger competitor give you greater opportunities to grow the balance sheet at all kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so were going to still manage the balance sheet relative to our capital cet1 goals of getting towards to as you know msrs if they grow in an outsized way versus our internal capital generation become punitive so we will be sellers of msrs throughout the year and with that we also hope if we sell to nonbanks that we keep deposits that accompany with these msrs as well as possibly even providing msr financing to the buyers and that was always our premise as when we bought amerihome andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc understood okay thanks for the questions operator thank you the next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks hey dale the capital build in the quarter i think the way im thinking about it many thought you would build capital in some part you build reserve im interested kind of in your dynamic how youre thinking about building one versus the other and could you just remind us is the target i think prior commentaries to get there by midyear but with recent efforts and maybe some more like any change in timeline there dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp sure so i mean it really starts with the reserve so we look at our loans our exposures and overlay that with what moodys says and our own interpretation of kind of market and economic market sentiment outlook and we derive gaap compliance kind of seasonal numbers and i realize that ratio is lower than some others in this space and i think you dont have to look any further than our asset quality in terms of chargeoff behavior and changes in terms of kind of whats transpired there i mean we have in the slide deck we have kind of our segmentation in terms of creditprotected resistant resilient and then the more sensitive piece and that is just a small fraction oneeighth of our loan book is something that we think is going to have some perhaps volatility another measure that that we look at is you take your acl and divide that by annual chargeoffs and i mean we had zero this year but even if you took a couple of basis points on it and divide that into basis points youre going to get years of chargeoffs i know this is not this is better than most years but the average duration of our loan book is only under four so all sorts of ways we look at it and we think our reserve works as is so now its about what do we talk about in terms of what calls down to the bottom line in terms of tangible common equity i wouldnt move up our timeline western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 at all i think basis points is a fairly significant move for one quarter but were going to do both were going to grow capital and were going to grow our balance sheet at the same time sustain an improving trajectory in terms of net interest income and sustain our returns while our capital continues to climb towards the high later this year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp chris to be very specific i think you can look for us to be in that capital range of to towards the back end of the year weve got a real jump on  by opportunistically selling some loans and then being able to move quickly in the efr space thats our capital call and subscription lines so quite frankly were pretty proud that we were able to move the capital bps in one quarter but i think you can look towards the back end of the year for those numbers christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and thats ken thats all organically right theres no more clns assumed in that kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp we dont have any clns assumed in there and certainly no atm either christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks though operator thank you the next question comes from the line of david smith with autonomous you may proceed david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp hi there can you share the run rate for the ecr and then deposit costs as of what that would be on kind of a fullquarter basis dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i wouldnt say they materially changed from where we were for the quarterly number so it didnt grow quite as much as maybe something i anticipated because the dollars came down in terms of ecr deposits but i think that we can track from the fourth quarter number overlay what you think is going to happen in terms of the terms of effluency actions and what you thinks going to happen on the balance sheet in those particular categories that should work david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp okay western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp we showed you commissioned dollars david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp great dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp we have in there with one of those baked in david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and in terms of the mortgage warehouse deposit book can you share the breakdown between noninterest bearing and interest bearing there is it notably different from what the mix was for the bank as a whole as of the fourth quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so most of the mortgage warehouse deposits are in dda with an ecr and that is the preponderance of all the ecr dollars that we have david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp got it okay thank you and lastly in terms of the rwa benefit that you got from the reduction of equity fund resources could you expand on that a little bit i imagine that it might it must not be zerorisk weighting but given the kind of the risk that those loans tend to have it must be a pretty low risk weighting i would have thought dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp general construct of providing a creditlinked note is to provide protection ie first loss taken by a thirdparty so we get funds in we shell our bonds with third party and they get that interest on that bond less any losses that arise from this reference pool so on the efr loans the subscription lines theyre normally riskweighted but because weve sold it on to a thirdparty and they assume first loss the first of losses in that portfolio they pay and actually we already have their money so we control on how much they get back because well only pay them back less any losses incurred and because of that architecture whereby you have moved the now kind of the structured product to a double layer better category its basically treated as riskweighted assets so no matter what type asset you come from you end up at so residential you start at end at capital calling warehouse you start at and you still end up at western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp okay got it so without the ceiling though the riskweighting is got it its good to know thank you operator thank you the next question comes from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo please proceed timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon just a couple followups with deposit growth expecting to exceed loan growth in whats the excess funding going to be used for is it primary focused initially to pay down some of this nearterm borrowing or is that excess funding going to be layered into the securities book kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp it could be either or but our first goal would probably be to lower our borrowings and take down that cost timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then again following up on the large banks exiting the correspondents space and thank you for not mentioning the bank by name but pretty large player in the space what happens to that market share is that market share kind of split amongst the rest of the constituents and are you expecting amerihomes portion to grow or are you more or less kind of ringfencing that and keeping the existing business as is with kind of competitors maybe getting more of that market share thats for grabs kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so i think like some of the other competitors they balance market share with gainonsale margin and thats what we do so if we can hold our existing market share and grow the gainonsale margin that works for us and thats sort of where weve been and i think thats what the industry is trying to do there seems to be a little discipline going on here but without mentioning that bank that left its early days and well wait and see and well clearly have more color on it as we get through the end of the first quarter during the third quarter which is when margins dropped we did a little experiment whereby we pulled back in terms of activity and purchase volume and we saw margins move up a little bit in that scenario and im not sure thats the reason why but they basically stayed at a somewhat elevated place from how far they had fallen to in the fourth quarter so i dont know were encouraged by that and well see what happens timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you operator thank you the next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc please proceed western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks hello everyone kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey question for you on the chart you have on the slide the economically resilient portfolio positioning thats a mouthful sorry what do you expect that mix to look like in one to two years from now i guess another way is wheres the emphasis in terms of your growth drivers from where were starting today timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp hi tim bruckner ill audio gap you will see us focus growth particularly through any potential or real recession in areas that are resistant to recession at the same time youll see us reduce our exposures in some of the more sensitive areas so well do that more with precision than with a broader brush but specifically getting lowering exposure getting out of industries that are particularly sensitive and that really the resistant areas thats sticking to our knitting when we talk about growth there were talking about relationship growth so these are with sponsors that we know not just at the micro level but at the top of the house and were growing specifically at low loan to value high amount of sponsor investment in the deal what were doing differently though right now we can do we can be more selective is were being very selective about the submarkets as well that were in if its real estate related and thats where were growing jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay got it dale question for you the ppnr growth of to maybe obvious but what do you see as the key risks meaning what brings you closer to or below and what could put you at the higher end dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so i mean first and foremost we see our cash in front of us is sustaining deposit growth with deposit growth weve got the balance sheet leveraged we have opportunity in the asset side to deploy this at significant spreads which will drive nii obviously driving ppnr which and of course avoiding much in terms of the provision costs other than the higher values so i think thats the number one thing sustaining our deposit growth and weve got a number of initiatives and some of them are coming to fruition i think now and we think were going to be on track jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc tim qualitative reserve size any help you can give us on that how big is the qualitative piece of your reserve western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp yeah i can its as far as the youre talking about the qualitative adjustments on the acl right jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp about jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then ken just one for you how are you judged how are you guys judged is it tangible book value growth is it eps is it credit where are you guys most focused in terms of the financial metrics that we look at for the coming year thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so as it relates to performance its sort of up and down both the income statement and the balance sheet as determined by our shortterm or sti compensation eps loan growth deposit growth asset quality operational quality and the growth in our capital base in terms of the lti of course its share price and the share price is motivated by the growth in eps and so those are the things that we focus on jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you operator thank you there are no additional questions at this time i would now hand the call over to ken vecchione for closing remarks kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hi thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you about  results in the next couple of months thanks operator that now concludes todays conference call thank you you may now disconnect your line
