conclusion of our prepared remarks we will take your questions was a record year on many levels for western alliance bank and demonstrated the powerful vantages of our diversified and distinctive business model to continue advancing our key strategic objectives which include promoting disciplined and thoughtful loan growth matched with rising deposits carefully managing our balance sheet with regards to asset sensitivity derisking our loan composition maintaining industryleading operating efficiency and thoughtfully returning capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 financially was a terrific year and was our 10th consecutive year of rising earnings for the year we produced record revenues of billion net income of million and eps of these results were driven by record organic loan and deposit growth of billion and billion respectively which generated the highest total revenues in the companys history against the backdrop of a volatile and falling rate environment as our bank has scaled and matured we also took new capital management actions this year and announced our inaugural quarterly dividend of in  and repurchased million shares reducing our share count by given all these actions tangible book value per share grew yearoveryear to and has now grown by over the past six years as we continue to expand our business we believe shareholder value is deeply correlated to loan deposit and revenue growth outstanding asset quality and predictable and sustainable earnings as you can see  was an extraordinary quarter for western alliance as eps of grew yearoveryear and was accompanied by strong asset quality metrics fourth quarter loan growth of billion and deposit growth of million drove our balance sheet to billion in assets as a reminder deposit growth is seasonally lower in this quarter as our warehouse lending clients pay down taxes from custodial accounts housed with us the yearly deposit growth noted above was supported by the best year ever for our hoa business they were up million tech and innovation which knocked the ball out of the park with growth of billion and our deposit initiatives which saw our balances rise over million on the lending side our regional banking divisions continue their healthy growth trajectory generating over million growth yearoveryear after the reduction of construction land and development loans of million our residential mortgage program warehouse lending and hotel franchise finance added billion and million respectively to the loan portfolio during the quarter we achieved our goal to reduce the relative proportion of our construction land and development loans below our target to of total loans one year earlier than our december target of note captured in the billion of loan growth was a million reduction in cld beginning in we undertook a program to mitigate our interest rate risk and support our eps growth objectives through the expansion of high quality residential loans originated by our mortgage warehouse clients this quarter demonstrated our ability to successfully execute on our strategy to grow revenues through the transition to a lower rate environment as net interest income for the quarter climbed to million or on a linked quarter annual basis quarterly nim was only down basis points from  at full year operating noninterest expenses grew million to million producing an efficiency ratio of our operating efficiency ratio increased from in as net interest income growth was impacted by the three fed rate reductions for the fourth quarter operating noninterest expenses grew million to million from the prior quarter inclusive of approximately million in onetime nonrecurring expenses credit quality remains stable this quarter special mention loans dropped million to million from  substandard loans on an absolute dollar basis are at their lowest point since when our balance sheet was only half the size it is today chargeoffs were million in  and fullyear chargeoffs were basis points of loans western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 our tangible common equity ratio ended at for compared to at  and for for the year we returned million to shareholders through our stock repurchase program and dividend distributions fullyear return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity were and respectively compared to and in we remain one of the most profitable banks in the industry finally and most importantly all of our accomplishments cannot be achieved without the dedication and professionalism of our management team and the people of western alliance they make the unassailable difference their drive enthusiasm and standard of excellence is the secret sauce of our company dale will now take you through our financial performance dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation thanks ken for the year net interest income rose million or to just over billion net income of million increased million or and eps of increased from the prior year demonstrating the impact of our stock repurchase program for the fourth quarter strong ongoing balance sheet growth resulted in record earnings despite headwinds from a flattening yield curve that preceded an anticipated fed rate cuts net interest income rose million or annualized from the third quarter to million driven by a million increase in average earning assets which outweighed reduced loan yields for the corresponding period last year net interest income rose the provision for credit losses was million for the quarter which was consistent with the prior period noninterest income decreased million from the third quarter to million as equity investment income from our tech innovation segment and net gains on sales of investment securities were elevated in the third quarter noninterest expense was up million as data processing professional fees and incentives and yearend bonuses increased by million million and million respectively which partially offset a million decrease in deposit cost compensation costs were affected by increased accruals for annual incentive and bonus plans share repurchases in  of reduced the diluted share count to million resulting in diluted eps of for the quarter throughout we reduced shares outstanding by by opportunistically repurchasing million shares for our board has authorized a new share repurchase plan for up to million turning to net interest drivers net interest income for the quarter rose million yearoveryear to a record million investment yield decreased basis points from the prior quarter to due to a flattening yield curve and lower reinvestment rate lower longterm rates increased mortgage prepayment speeds and the resulting accelerated amortization of premium was responsible for lowering the overall quarterly portfolio yield from the prior year on a linkedquarter basis loan yields decreased basis points due to reduction in interest rates and spreads further impacting the decline in yields was our intentional mix shift towards residential loans and the decline in libor which preceded the cuts in the fed funds rate and prime western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 interestbearing deposit costs decreased by basis points in  to as a result of proactive steps taken to reduce our deposit rates immediately after the fed cut rates in october outpacing the reduction that we had in loan yields this decreased funding costs by basis points when all of the companys funding costs are considered including noninterestbearing deposits as well as borrowings as ken mentioned this quarter demonstrated our ability to successfully grow net interest income through the transition to a lower rate environment strong balance sheet growth and proactive steps taken to reduce the cost of interestbearing deposits resulted in net interest income growth of on a linkedquarter annualized basis despite the strategic shift in our loan mix away from construction and the overall reduction in market rates the net interest margin only declined basis points to during the quarter as the basis point reduction in earning asset yield was offset by a basis point decrease in total funding costs with regards to our asset sensitivity our rate risk profile has declined notably as our mix shift to primarily fixed rate residential loans has reduced our net interest income variability due to changes in the rate environment meanwhile billion of our variable rate loans are now behaving as fixed rate since the rate floors are now in effect active this has reduced our interest rate risk in a basis point parallel shock lower scenario to only of expected net interest income at december from at september and in june when we commenced our residential loan diversification program should rates decline from here we believe a rampdown scenario is a much more probable rate reduction outcome which further reduces our rate risk profile by another we believe we are now positioned to asymmetrically benefit if rates rise but have limited downside net interest income risk if rates should fall with an additional basis point rate cut another billion of loans with floors will be triggered which will further reduce sensitivity and mitigate our margin compression our interest rate mitigation program has lowered our volatility if rates decline further while maintaining significant upside if rates rise again to be clear in a ramp scenario if rates decline basis points of net interest income is at risk however if rates go up basis points we would have a positive impact to net interest income double the effect in a downrate scenario turning now to operating efficiency in  yearoveryear we produced another quarter of positive operating leverage while continuing to invest in new products and business initiatives to continue to drive organic growth on a linkedquarter basis our efficiency ratio increased basis points to which includes the million of onetime expenses that ken mentioned earlier despite progress we have made to reduce the asset sensitivity and net interest income at risk our efficiency ratio in was still affected by decline in nim caused by the falling rate environment adjusting nim compression driven by the three fed rate cuts our efficiency ratio would have remained flat from the year ago period as a core component of our strategy and irrespective of the rate environment we will continue disciplined expense management to maintain industryleading operating leverage and profitability our preprovision net revenue roa was and return on assets was for the quarter the fourth quarter decline in operating ppnr roa of basis points was directly related to the margin decline of basis points over the same period these metrics continue to be in the top decile compared to peers our strong balance sheet growth momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased million to billion and deposit growth of million brought our deposit balance to billion at quarterend our western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 loantodeposit ratio increased to from in  our strong liquidity position continues to provide us with balance sheet flexibility to pursue attractive riskadjusted lending opportunities we grew our shareholders equity by million to billion from and tangible book value per share increased over the prior quarter and or over the prior year to per share our industry leading financial performance is a direct result of our distinctive business model which combines the commercial banking relationships within our regional footprint and our national business lines total loan growth was driven by increases in ci loans of million residential loans of million and commercial real estate nonowner occupied loans of million strong ci growth was supported by approximately million in tech innovation and million in mortgage warehouse lending residential loans now comprise of our loan portfolio while construction loans decreased another million and now make up of total loans at yearend versus of total loans when compared to the prior quarter we believe our ability to profitably grow deposits is both a key differentiator and a core value driver to our platforms longterm value creation despite  being seasonally weak for deposits we were able to grow them million for the quarter a decrease of million in noninterestbearing dda primarily from warehouse lending was offset by growth in net interestbearing ddas and savings in money market accounts of million and million respectively over the last year deposits grew across all categories with the largest increases in savings and money market deposit accounts of billion and noninterestbearing dda of billion during deposit growth has been billion of which has been in noninterestbearing accounts the deposit growth of billion for the year was used to fully fund loan growth of billion overall asset quality remained stable with credit ratios at historically low levels total adversely graded assets decreased million during the quarter to million as special mention credits were reduced million to basis points of total assets from the prior year total adversely graded assets have increased just million versus a billion rise in loans resulting in reduced ratio to total assets of from nonperforming assets comprised of loans on nonaccrual and repossessed real estate increased marginally to million or to total asset and continue to hold steady as a proportion of the balance sheet regarding the reduction in total adversely graded assets as discussed last quarter we view special mention loan credits as an early indicator of potential stress that has little correlation to loan becoming nonperforming overall weve seen nothing in our portfolio that raises concerns or indicates a change in our credit outlook gross credit losses of million during the quarter were offset by in recoveries resulting in net loan losses of million or basis points of total loans annualized the credit loss provision of million remained consistent with the prior quarter provisioning related to our loan growth also increased the allowance for loan and lease losses to million up million from a year ago resulting in a reserve of basis points of total gross loans held for investment at december in advance with the adoption of cecl in the first quarter of weve included historical information on our reserve for our unfunded loan commitment and credit discounts on acquired loans which we believe better represents the total allowance for credit losses going forward inclusive of these additional reserves our allowance for credit loss ratio to total loans would have been basis points in  western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 finally regarding the transition to cecl in the first quarter of this year we expect day one increase in reserves of approximately million or which on an aftertax basis will reduce our tangible common equity ratio by approximately basis points assuming the economic backdrop relative mix level of loan growth and the duration of credits remains consistent our goforward allowance for loan losses will remain relatively stable at the new cecl adoption reserve level of approximately basis points which is inclusive of the million day one charge as a reminder under prior gaap our provisioning was based upon an incurred loss model while under cecl were estimating lifetime losses and provisioning for them at the time of loan origination and finally we continue to generate significant capital and maintain strong regulatory ratios with tangible common equity to total assets of and a common equity tier ratio of despite the payment of our quarterly cash dividend of per share our tangible common equity per share rose in the quarter to and is up from a year earlier notably our production of tangible book value has been more than three times that of the peer group over the past six years given capital requirements that banks operate under we believe that consistent capital accretion is fundamental to value creation ill turn the call back to ken kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation thanks dale on the heels of achieving several corporate milestones in we are excited by the growth opportunities in both our regional and national business lines in we continue to hold to the belief that predictable eps and tangible book value growth will drive industry leading total shareholder returns in we expect to one continue to thoughtfully and conservatively grow loans our pipelines appear strong and we expect to grow loans between million to million per quarter funded by deposit growth balance sheet growth will drive net interest income growth despite marginal nim compression as deposits come back in  and  our liquidity will rise placing some pressure on margin as we continue our residential real estate diversification strategy given the backdrop of a flat rate environment our efficiency ratio should remain stable near current levels throughout the year even as we continue to invest in technology and new products these actions should position us to return to excuse me these actions should position us to continue industry leading return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity at this time well field your question operator would you open up the line please western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from timur braziler of wells fargo securities please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc starting with the margin it looks like nim benefited from some higher loan fees and pretty impressive reduction in funding cost during the quarter im just wondering how big of a step down do you think is going to take place in assuming that loan fees normalize and i would love to hear about your expectations on future possibilities to cut deposit costs dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah so youre correct it was a little higher and a little higher than what we guided to i think the core margin for the fourth quarter was about a if you kind of back that off and then from there going forward we are going to continue to whittle down the margin based upon the execution of our residential mortgage program as that becomes an increasingly large proportion of our loan portfolio weve stated that we think thats going to be maybe basis points a month a quarter in any case we can kind of easily earn through that in terms of net interest income by the balance sheet growth that we expect to have if we dont see any more rate increases and i realize the futures market still has one in there i think it might be unlikely that were going to see one frankly in before the election but if we dont see any i think the opportunity for increased funding cost reduction is fairly limited i think we have gotten the rates down a lot and we are in a little more of a compressed yield environment as we were on the way up when rates were lower but we can were good with the margins kind of in the range and we believe we can execute upon that timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it and then switching over to the expenses as you look at the pipeline for future projects expenses grew roughly on a core basis in is that a good type of run rate to think of for or is the slower revenue growth going to correlate to a slower expense growth western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well i expect that were going to be able to hold our efficiency ratio essentially kind of where it is in the kind of the lower and we believe that we can continue to grow with that and increase funds that we have weve been investing in to improve the products and services and the future functionality of our systems during for example we had significant outlays to improve the experience for hoa clients and that we think was instrumental to the very strong growth we had there we expect to do the same so i would look for our efficiency to be fairly our efficiency ratio to be fairly flat as we go through timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just one last one for me looking at the residential mortgage growth and the punitive treatment of resi mortgages under cecl does that at all change your appetite to grow that lending category and i guess how should we be thinking about provisioning as that becomes a larger component of the loan book dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah so its only punitive if it has a kind of a large charge associated with it of course residential loans do have a larger much longer duration than what some of our average loan length have been and so that could have an effect but the types of residential loans were acquiring that is ltvs in the ficos debtto income in the mid those metrics result in a very low estimated annual chargeoff and so even when i multiply that by a duration factor its still a low number so increasing our proportion of our loan book into residential is not going to be increasing our overall reserve in a cecl world above the basis points so i dont see an increase there in fact but i think it could dribble down slightly timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thank you operator our next question comes from michael young of suntrust please go ahead michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey thanks for taking the question i wanted to first ask just maybe about the competitive landscape in particular and some of the national business lines like mortgage warehouse do you see an opportunity to take more market share or grow at a faster rate than any of them in given some market disruption from acquisitions kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah this is ken overall i would say the competitive landscape hasnt really changed for the entire book of business as it relates to warehouse lending yeah we see some opportunity for disruption there and we see some opportunity to take advantage both on the loan side and on the deposit side michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 okay and just dale maybe a followup on the onetofour family strategy you mentioned continuing that this year whats kind of the overall eventual goal there it sounds like youre pretty wellpositioned from an alco perspective right now but should we expect you to go all the way to kind of a neutral balance on the alco dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation i dont think well get that far what we see about this is it strengthens the relationship with our mortgage warehouse clients it mitigates our interest rate risk it positions us in an asset class that we think is going to perform very well throughout the credit cycle and we have very ph in we had very strong deposit growth and its like well this is a great goto asset to take advantage of to again improve earnings improve earnings per share growth and were getting yields well above what we could do if were buying residential mortgagebacked securities for example i dont expect this to necessarily get to or something like that where the peer group is but we have plenty of runway to grow basically kind of the same pace as we did in and we think that gives us a sustained kind of a growth model assuming that we have the kind of the funding sources to be able to apply them michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay maybe just one last one on the share buyback versus dividend increase kind of how are you guys feeling about deploying capital through one versus the other at this point or are there ma opportunities we should be thinking of dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation so for us as you look at capital when we started the year we said that about twothirds of our capital thats generated is used to support organic growth we ended the year with about threequarters of the organic capital that we generate to support growth so our first and foremost best use of capital is for organic growth the dividend policy has been set and then lastly well be as we always say opportunistic when either the stock show some weakness or the overall market show some weakness to come in and buy michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thanks operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks ken maybe the ma aspect to that question could you elaborate youve got your multiple up a little bit could you remind us market size what youre seeing in terms of books that might interest you thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation so at this time theres really nothing going on on the ma front and we are rather quiet there as we see better opportunities to grow our business organically and quite frankly thats where were spending most of our time we have a viewpoint into that says its going to look a little bit like in terms of the momentum that we western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 had in and by sticking organically well see or have less execution risk with an organic strategy than if you do an acquisition in addition the market has not been kind to acquiring banks as you know so at this point were in the very fortunate place of saying we dont need to do an acquisition for revenue growth loan growth we dont need to do an acquisition to take out expenses and we dont need one so that we can move our eps or net income up so we have as much optionality as one would want and right now as i said all quiet on the ma front and were spending a lot of our time on looking how to continue to organically grow christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great color thanks just one more i think in the past youve guided to that million a quarter dale of growth youve obviously come in well above that in recent quarters i think the comments for million to million is that just marking the market kind of how youve been performing exceeding guidance or is that are you trying to send a message that hey we feel even stronger about growth going into kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation were building our plans around that million to million bogey there some quarters it may be closer to million and in some quarters it may be million or more as youve seen this quarter was billion and the last couple of quarters it was billion so we are looking and i think what the most important thing here is asset quality that will drive us to the right decision in terms of growth right now the asset quality appears good in our overall book and were not seeing a lot of deals that are being won on structure meaning theyre loosening up covenants were not seeing that so we feel comfortable in this million to million range and youll get to mark us to market at the end of next quarter and see how we do against that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator our next question comes from casey haire of jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good morning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc one just following up on sort of the capital management would you guys ever entertain a special dividend thats an option that you guys have not used it could be compelling if the stock price seems high and the buyback is not an option western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah first lets remember we have a long history of dividend distributions of two consecutive quarters and so i dont think we want to get ahead of that until at least we hit four so were going to continue on with the dividend quarterly growth were going to always talk to the board about the best way to return capital to our shareholders and its really i think really too early at this point to start thinking about special dividends specifically as you see we moved the amount of capital were using for organic means up from twothirds to threequarters so we are trying to find good thoughtful conservative managed loans to bring onto the balance sheet casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you and to that end so on the long growth front if i look at slide in your outlook for do you see that the loan growth mix sort of tracking that the loan growth mix in tracking that same level of ci resi and cre kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation well the nice thing about our distinctive business model is that we get to move capital around all throughout the year to take advantage of the best returns and where we think the credit is the strongest and where sometimes competition is a little less active so as we plan through the cycle generally just about every business has the same growth rate to try to achieve as we execute that becomes a different story as we look almost daily or weekly as we look to move capital around to where we find the best opportunities and that really has been the success of one of the reasons western alliance has been so successful dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation i mean i would expect the construction piece were under billion now to hover in that kind of the billion to billion range the residential is going to be continue to climb from billion now i think thats going to certainly go into the teens and the others as ken mentioned depend upon kind of the best risk adjusted returns that we have within those categories casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks and just last question for me on credit quality dale it sounds like the outlook is very clean theres nothing systemic that you see i think were all everyones very impressed with your ability to keep the ncos low but i mean when you a lot of investors out there i would say like its only so sustainable given the risk profile can you just give us some thoughts as to what when you see some of your peers catch a commercial credit and the leverage loan book comes to mind specifically with you guys what are you guys doing differently that is enabling you to avoid catching these credits kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation all right this is ken first i have to step back big picture our portfolio today looks fine we dont see any economic stress from the economy and to answer your more specific question we think our welldiversified portfolio which again is consistent with this business model we have helps us to avoid some pitfalls so for example we dont do energy loans weve gotten out of solar we have very little qsr loans on the books we western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 dont have large retail malls these are all things that we have stopped doing years ago or maybe a year ago so were trying to look for where we see there where theres possibles of the credit hiccups and avoid that next back to the national business lines the national business lines for the most part weve never seen losses so lets go through timeshare weve never had a loss and the team thats running it has never had a loss in years warehouse lending weve had that business going on years never had a loss municipal lending weve had one small loss for over the last years even our hotel book is very well positioned when i if you want to talk about our debt service coverage ratio or ltv and our debt yields for example so weve been fortunate to be playing in spaces in the national business lines that other banks do not play in and remember the national business lines have four characteristics to them one generally theres less competition which allows us to have fairly good pricing power or pricing stability good operating leverage and last but not least as i described good asset quality and dale you want to add anything to that dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah regarding the corporate finance notes that you mentioned we monitor those those are liquid loans and we monitor that pricing daily if there is a price deterioration thats going on if we dont understand why that is its you know what sell first and then ask questions later so well cut a particular haircut down or something like that and get out and we really move quickly on those types of deals casey haire a analyst jefferies llc great thank you operator our next question comes from brad milsaps of piper sandler please go ahead brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey ken and dale kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation hi brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co ken i was just curious if you could update us on maybe the number of new producers you hired in and kind of what your appetite would be for new revenue producers in kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah weve been rather fortunate that through most of our businesses weve not had large attrition in our revenue producers i will say its a little more competitive up in northern california in the tech innovation business but relatively speaking were not pushing heavily to bring in new producers given the runway that we see in front of us western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 and some of the businesses that we started certainly on the loan initiatives that we started in and both of our two loan initiatives had great results so we brought in people there earlier in and we need to get them comfortable with our way of doing business so dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation in terms of the fte increase a good portion of that has really been to increase infrastructure so those have been in operations and it areas and also kind of personnel development for that as tim mentioned most of the positions weve had in terms of frontline producers have been fairly static over the past year brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co yes so thats where my next question it sounds like youve got plenty of capacity on staff without really having to add any additional revenue producers in a big way kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yes i think thats fair brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co and maybe as a followup as you look at your million to million quarterly loan and deposit goal which side of that would be looks easier to attain against a backdrop of being maybe more selective with credit versus its always difficult to grow deposits just kind of curious which pipeline might be bigger or which side of that equation you kind of feel better about as you move through the year based on kind of what you see in the pipeline kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation its funny all pipeline conversations change almost weekly depending on when deals are going to close or when people are making their customer calls so quite frankly they both have the same probability of occurring i just think you may see some were not that good to make sure every quarter is exactly lined up but if you look at as an example it did eventually line up very very well if you go back to  deposits came out of the chute very very strong loans were okay and then it ended just the reverse with loans being very strong and deposits being okay but netnet loans grew billion deposits grew billion so thats what were trying to do is to kind of as i said in my outlook to have deposits match the loan growth dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation i like getting the deposits in i like leading with deposits i think that gives you that really gives you inventory that you can find alternatives hey if its a bad economy we can go to residential if we think things are growing weve got a more expansive kind of product array on the loan side that we can offer if we continue to sustain good core deposit growth thats going to drive improving earnings per share brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 great thank you guys nice quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation thank you operator our next question comes from gary tenner of da davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks just one question for me in terms of the million of nonrecurring items in the quarter could you give any detail on that was it severance was it tax writedown just any kind of back background there dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah so i mean it kind of enumerated a little bit but yeah so we had a very strong we had an accrual catchup in terms of incentive compensation that we recognized we continue to build out as i mentioned on one particular product regarding hoa but both infrastructure regarding future functionality of products regulatory compliance and sustaining what we need to do there as well so its a little bit elevated in the fourth quarter in terms of kind of what those charges came in but in some respects theyre going to continue as i mentioned were going to expect to have basically a stable efficiency ratio going forward which means that our revenue growth in dollars is going to be more than double what were going to be increasing in expense gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay thank you operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet of ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good morning brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc good morning dale just going back to your deposit pricing comment it sounded like there wasnt you werent expecting much scope there to further down deposit costs i just wanted to talk about that kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation sure western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation so we got in front of i think the market as rates were coming down and we moved within hours after each of the fed changes and today where we see our pricing relative to kind of the competitive environment is we dont see that weve got a whole lot of latitude relative to what others are paying and of course we have these kind of everyone does these online banks that are charging or providing returns much much higher than what local institutions do so that doesnt mean there isnt some kind of changes we can kind of make on the margin but i think people have kind of settled into that kind of the term structure of the yield curve that we have today and i think its been fairly quiet out there for rate changes not just for us but for the market of late as well brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and others have asked about this as well but within that resi portfolio and these rates loan yields lets say bps above agency conforming could you talk about whats in there in a little bit more detail number one and number two as this portfolio grows relative to other components do you think there could be a leak down in the reserve given that this may have a lower some benefit under cecl which you may have alluded to dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah it does have some benefit under cecl and it could kind of wiggle down maybe over time of course cecl youre always in this process of kind of reconfirming and testing and testing your models and back testing them so there could be other changes that will take place but so a couple of things one is we are not intending to buy agency qualifying paper so that is part of the reason that picks us up in yield so were not expecting to kind of bundle this up and ship it off to fannie freddie or anything like that so from our warehouse clients were buying some of the stuff that doesnt qualify to their primary liquidity channel which is one of these gses so what do we buy so theres some jumbo in there its not a lot the average balance on this stuff is under but there is some jumbo that doesnt qualify theres this significant piece of something that isnt owner occupied so these could be vacation home or something else that could make it ineligible for these agencies to pick up but again were looking for things that improve the yield to us but dont increase the risk so again these are really low these are low ltv loans theyre good to high fico scores but theyre not necessarily their primary residence we also look for things that are maybe theres some defect in the process that makes them ineligible for it theres been like timing on right of rescission theres been of kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western

transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation they have a slight imperfection dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah and so well take those and we get a cheaper price for it brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay great thank you operator our next question comes from david chiaverini of wedbush securities please go ahead david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks a couple of questions for you so a followup first on the deposit discussion whats giving you confidence on the deposit side to fund that increased growth of million to million is it new initiatives or getting more entrenched in existing businesses just curious there kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation i think there are a couple of things one the way our business is structured a we have an hoa business again you heard us say that grew deposits over million we put money against different technology we think that technology improvement has allowed us to bring in more deposits this year so that channel helps us the tech innovation channel generally brings in deposits on a twotoone basis our warehouse lending channel with all the ways we touch the warehouse lending clients allows us to bring in deposits that are oneto one so we have a number of channels that create its own natural momentum for us to grow and then the things we always say were a payforperformance culture so everyones out looking to get deposits we dont do a loan without getting the operating accounts weve got minimum liquidity requirements in our loan docs in case you dont hold your deposits at a certain level we have an opportunity to reprice your loan your yield so its all those things as it relates to the loan initiatives weve gotten a little traction on the deposit initiatives weve gotten a little traction there we grew both of those over million we are still keeping our eye on that wed rather be a little slower and right and give the clients the best customer service experience than to be fast bring in stuff and not service the client and since we have the opportunity through these other channels to bring in deposits we can take it a little slower on the new initiatives and wait to when we feel ready to go out and bring them in at a faster pace dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation but our new initiatives had a great year i mean tech innovation up billion hoa up million so its been both western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thats helpful and should we expect a similar mix in that deposit growth between interestbearing and noninterestbearing dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah i think if we can hold our own on interestbearing dollars i think thats doing pretty well on noninterest bearing dollars so i mean i could see over time and particularly if rates rise thats going to be a little more difficult so i would like to hold our own dollars on the noninterestbearing side maybe most of the growth comes from interestbearing david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks very much operator our next question is from jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a couple of followups can you talk about going where competition is less active is that the case in the cld book im just curious the yields look good and youre a little bit under and just curious what your thought is on that book going forward kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah so on that book were going to float between and this quarter as it relates to the percentage you saw both a numerator and a denominator impact denominator went up billion and we focused on the numerator and that came down million we primarily did that through pricing so we priced up a little bit we did get some deals at our pricing and the ones we didnt get well we waited for loans to roll off the books we didnt replace them and thats how we brought the ratio down but some of the aspects of what we do in that book the competition is not any more competitive than its been for the last two or three years jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and then your ability to get there a year early its just simply what you just said pricing and letting some things roll off western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation and the denominator jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then two other followups the other national business line growth was really strong for the quarter you talked a bit about the mortgage warehouse anything else to call out in that segment kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation i dont think anything pops right off the top of my head i think its really the growth was in those segments jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then last one tech spending is the other area that you called out in your expense guidance you mentioned hoa but talk a little bit about the initiatives and where youre spending the tech money where its focused thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah so our spending is really targeted against the client satisfaction and offering products and improved service and my hypothesis is that i think a lot of banks are going to pull back in because they dont have the growth aspects that we have and i think theyre going to service their clients to the level that the clients want to be serviced at so i think by continuing to improve our service offering i think one well have a happy clientele and number two as you saw in hoa well be able to either hold deposits or bring in more deposits jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay yeah there are a lot of your peers are talking about expense programs no doubt about it thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation okay you got it operator our next question comes from tyler stafford of stephens please go ahead western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys and thanks for taking the question when i compared the management outlook slide in for in the deck released yesterday to the outlook slide last year you guys kept the loan and deposit growth the same the interest margin the same the operating leverage the same and the asset quality the same but this year you added earnings to it obviously the outlook is very favorable that you guys have talked about so far on this call im just curious given that you added that to the slide if you wanted to comment just around the pace of earnings growth or how comfortable you felt with the earnings growth in especially given a lot of your peers are not growing earnings thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah one its good to hear that we are rather consistent yearoveryear with loan and deposit growth interest margin operating leverage and asset quality the point of earnings was the cumulative effect of all that will produce yearoveryear earnings and again as we said in our prepared remarks higher earnings higher tangible book value will lead to a better valuation over the long term and to distinguish ourselves from our peer group that may have a little trouble growing earnings i think only helps us tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay thanks ken and then just going back to the buyback would you expect to fully utilize the authorization this year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation im not going to make a forecast on that other than to say think about how weve done it so far and i think weve done it in a very managed and prudent way when theres plenty of growth that growth is supported by capital we realized we are running with a little more capital we initiated a dividend and if again if the stock looks weak if the market takes down everyone well have enough ammunition to come in and support the stock and buy what we hope will be at attractive pricing tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay understood congrats on a very strong quarter kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation thank you very much operator this concludes our questionandanswer session id like to turn the conference back over to ken vecchione for any closing remarks kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance
