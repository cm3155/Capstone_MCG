to repay wholesale borrowings pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary in the ordinary course of business the liquidity of cbna is managed by matching sources and uses of cash the primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities and wholesale borrowings as needed and as described under liquidity risk management and governance the primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits payment of interest on deposits funding of loans and related commitments and funding of securities purchases to the extent that cbna has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest for

liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk andor funding liquidity risk contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entitys ability to liquidate pledge andor finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality andor valuation of a security or loan issuer or borrower andor asset class funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions andor entityspecific events may reduce an entitys ability to raise funds from depositors andor wholesale market counterparties drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic reflecting impediments to operations andor damaged market confidence factors affecting liquidity given the composition of assets and borrowing sources contingent liquidity risk at cbna would be materially affected by events such as deterioration of financing markets for highquality securities eg mortgagebacked securities and other instruments issued by the gnma fnma and the fhlmc by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances andor by a refusal of the frb to act as a lender of last resort in systemic stress similarly given the structure of its balance sheet the funding liquidity risk of cbna would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event eg a major loss causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition an adverse systemic event eg default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant or a combination of both consequently and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively low table start

and collateralized advances from the fhlb existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices the frb occ and fdic regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process in addition we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements some of which are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators for further discussion see the regulation and supervision tailoring of prudential requirements and liquidity requirements sections in item liquidity risk management and governance liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury group in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset liability committee in managing liquidity risk the funding and liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies our funding and liquidity units primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic systemic and combination stress events and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and costefficient funding sources we seek to accomplish these goals by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities as of december organically generated deposits continue to be our primary source of funding resulting in a consolidated periodend loanstodeposits ratio excluding lhfs of our total available liquidity comprised of contingent liquidity and available discount window capacity

generally referred to as offbalance sheet arrangements for more information on these types of activities see note critical accounting estimates our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below see note for further discussion of our significant accounting policies allowance for credit losses the acl increased from billion at december to billion at december our acl as of december accounts for an economic forecast over our twoyear reasonable and supportable period with peak unemployment of approximately peaktotrough gdp decline of approximately and collateral value peaktotrough declines of approximately in home and approximately in used auto and truck this forecast incorporates the increased risk of a moderate recession beginning in the fourth quarter of and persisting for four consecutive quarters this compares to our december forecast which reflected real gdp growth of and an average unemployment rate of and real gdp growth of and average unemployment rate of our determination of the acl is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable period to illustrate the sensitivity we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which assumes that monetary tightening triggers a deeper real gdp contraction across our twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period resulting in a peaktotrough decline in real gdp excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately our modeled periodend acl or an increase of approximately million this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall periodend acl which includes qualitative adjustments table start citizens financial group inc table end because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the acl this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the acl or even what the acl would be under these economic circumstances the sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates the hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the acl and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates it remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our acl because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction and such changes may have differing impacts by product types the variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the economy including changing monetary and fiscal policies and their impact on inflationary trends as well as continuing supplychain challenges changes in one or multiple of the key macroeconomic variables may have a material impact to our estimation of expected credit losses for additional information regarding the acl see note and note fair value we asses the fair value of assets and liabilities by applying various valuation methodologies which often involve a significant degree of judgment particularly when active markets do not exist for the items being valued quoted market prices are used to estimate the fair value of certain assets such as trading assets most investment securities and residential real estate loans held for sale assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of items for which an observable active market does not exist examples of these items include loans deposits borrowings goodwill core deposit and other intangible assets other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations capitalized servicing assets pension and other postretirement benefit obligations estimated residual values of property associated with leases and certain derivative and other financial instruments assumptions management uses to estimate the fair value of items for which an observable active market does not exist include discount rates rates of return on assets repayment rates cash flows default rates costs of servicing and liquidation values the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of fair value which could have material positive or negative effects on the companys results of operations financial condition or disclosures of fair value information in addition to valuation we must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that require recognition of a loss in the consolidated statements of operations examples include

we are committed to maintaining a strong integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives a key aspect of our boards responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood to enable our board to carry out its objectives it has delegated authority for risk management activities as well as governance and oversight of those activities to a

of defense the business lines including their associated support functions are the first line of defense and are accountable for identifying assessing managing and controlling the risks associated with the products and services they provide the business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility complying with relevant risk policies testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their operational and financial reporting controls on a regular basis establishing and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk second line of defense the second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks and related policies this centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks including credit market operational regulatory reputational interest rate liquidity and strategic risks third line of defense our internal audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance with a view of the effectiveness of our internal controls governance practices and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size complexity and risk profile of the organization internal audit has complete and unrestricted access to any and all of our records physical properties and personnel internal audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to the boards audit committee on a quarterly basis credit review reports to the chief audit executive and provides the legalentity boards senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed credit risk appetite and credit policies and processes in line with its procedures and regulatory expectations the credit review function undertakes a program of portfolio testing assessing and reporting through four risk pillars of asset quality rating and data integrity risk management and credit risk appetite risk appetite risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool we define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we could be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations our principal nonmarket risks

and approved annually by the board risk committee credit risk overview credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer counterparty or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation while the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management and trading activities given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet the assessment approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall riskmanagement responsibility objective the independent credit risk function is responsible for reviewing and approving credit risk appetite across all lines of business and credit products approving larger and higher risk credit transactions monitoring portfolio performance identifying problem credit exposures and ensuring remedial management organizational structure management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the business line and the second line of defense the second line of defense the independent credit risk

to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies these policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite material changes in our business model and strategies that identify a need to change our risk appetite or highlight a risk not previously contemplated are identified by the individual committees and presented to the credit policy committee executive risk committee and the board risk committee for approval as appropriate key management processes we employ a comprehensive and integrated risk control program to proactively identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit life cycle origination account managementportfolio management and loss mitigation and recovery consumer on the consumer banking side of credit risk our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the life cycle of the loan starting at origination credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability length of term collateral value collateral type and lien subordination table start citizens financial group inc table end to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present there are exception limits which when reached trigger a comprehensive analysis once an account is established credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and where appropriate is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency commercial on the commercial banking side of credit risk risk management begins with defined credit products and policies and is separated into commercial and industrial loans cre and leases within commercial and industrial loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products eg assetbased lending leasing franchise finance health care technology and midcorporate a specialty vertical is a standalone team of industry or product specialists substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists cre also operates as a specialty vertical commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and with few exceptions are subject to a formal annual review requirement the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the pd and lgd all material transactions then require the approval of both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority the approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and updated regularly the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrowers management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations this group conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans and validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers concentration risk is managed through limits on industry asset class and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by a specialized group of credit professionals market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including the hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as the origination of loans and depositgathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage market risk for both nontrading and trading activities table start citizens financial group inc table end nontrading risk our nontrading banking activities expose us to market risk this market risk is composed of interest rate risk as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk we also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations as well as the valuation of our msrs interest rate risk interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets liabilities and equity we refer to this nontrading risk embedded in the balance sheet as structural interest rate risk or interest rate risk in the banking book a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets relative to liabilities and equity there are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity andor repricing of assets and liabilities for example the rate earned on a commercial loan may reprice monthly with changes in the benchmark rate while the rate paid on debt or certificates of deposit may be fixed for a longer period there may also be differences in the drivers of rate changes loans may be tied to a specific index rate such as libor or prime while deposits may be only loosely correlated with libor and dependent upon competitive demand due to these basis differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options for example most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can be withdrawn without penalty the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floatingrate loans relative to core deposit funding this source of asset sensitivity is more biased toward the short end of the yield curve the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixedrate loans as well as prepayment risk on mortgagerelated loans and securities funded by nonrate sensitive deposits and equity the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by our board these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within our risk appetite we must measure the exposure and hedge it as necessary the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on our structural interest rate risk position these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset liability committee and at board meetings we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both shortterm and longterm exposures the primary method we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a threeyear horizon exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across the scenarios key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate ie noncontractual maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments are the most significant behavioral assumptions for projections of deposit rates the bank utilizes product level models that consider the specific product characteristics and composition of the deposit portfolio along with current and forwardlooking market dynamics similarly the bank employs dynamic prepayment and mortgage rate models to project prepayment behaviors specific to each of our product offerings these models have been developed based on internal performance data over prior interest rate cycles and are calibrated to our experience and outlook for rates across a diverse set of market environments we assess our models and assumptions periodically by running sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of changes to inputs or assumptions on our risk results the results of these analyses are reported to the asset liability committee table start citizens financial group inc table end since we cannot predict the future path of interest rates we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a most likely implied forward scenario as well as a variety of extreme and unlikely scenarios these scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short or longterm rates predominate generally projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve as the following table illustrates our balance sheet is assetsensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limits established and monitored by senior management while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would be more gradual and therefore have a more modest impact the table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve table start table sensitivity of net interest income estimated change in net interest income over months december basis points instantaneous change in interest rates gradual change in interest rates table end we continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy changing market conditions and changes in our balance sheet asset sensitivity against a 200basis point gradual increase in rates was on december compared with on december the change reflects rising base net interest income including the impact of the investors acquisition and our ongoing hedge activity which locks in higher forward rates and reduces our exposure to evolving downside risks this reduction in asset sensitivity is partially offset by growth and a mix shift towards a higher proportion of floating rate consumer and commercial lending current levels of asset sensitivity will continue to provide upside benefit to net interest income as we progress through a period of expected higher shortterm policy rates from the frb changes in interest rates can also affect risk management activities which impact the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on assets that allow for early payoff without a penalty the risk position is managed within our risk limits and longterm view of interest rates through occasional adjustments to securities investments interest rate swaps and mix of funding we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk eve as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital we use interest rate contracts to manage the interest rate exposure to the variability in the interest cash flows on our floatingrate assets and floatingrate wholesale funding and

consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts market risk measurement we use var as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions our var framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same risk management var is based on a one day holding period to a confidence level whereas regulatory var is based on a tenday holding period to the same confidence level in addition to var nonstatistical measurements for measuring risk are employed such as sensitivity analysis market value and stress testing our market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models capture correlation effects across all our covered positions and allow for aggregation of market risk across products risk types business lines and legal entities we measure monitor and report market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes table start citizens financial group inc table end var overview the market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements general var such as changes in the level of interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period it is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions if required within this holding period vars benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio based on the composition of our covered positions we also use a standardized addon approach for the loan trading and high yield bond desks specific risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements the general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past trading days the internal var measure used as the basis of the main var trading limits is a confidence level with a one day holding period meaning that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur on average on only one day in trading days ie of the time theoretically there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year the regulatory measure of var is done at a confidence level with a tenday holding period the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a twobusiness day lag refer to market risk regulatory capital below for details of our tenday var metrics for the quarters ended december and respectively including high low average and period end var for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks as well as total var market risk regulatory capital the us banking regulators market risk rule covers the calculation of market risk capital under this rule all our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and qualify as covered positions the internal management var measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory var table start table results of modeled and nonmodeled measures for regulatory capital calculations in millions for the three months ended december for the three months ended december

riskweighted assets table end stressed var svar is an extension of var as it uses a longer historical lookback horizon that is fixed from january this is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods but also to provide a counterbalance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility the holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days in addition to risk management purposes svar is also a component of market risk regulatory capital we calculate svar daily under its own dynamic window regime in a dynamic window regime values of the tenday var are calculated over all possible 260day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set refer to market risk regulatory capital above for details of svar metrics including high low average and period end svar for the combined portfolio table start citizens financial group inc table end sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates basis spreads foreign exchange exposures option prices and credit spreads since var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations stress testing conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios for historical stress tests profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other risk measurement methodologies hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves happen simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as market events unfold we generate stress tests of our trading positions daily for example we currently include a stress test that simulates a lehmantype crisis scenario by taking the worst 20trading day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into var from that period and assumes they occurred simultaneously var model review and validation market risk measurement models used are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owners the independent review and validation focuses on model methodology market data and performance independent review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of citizens model risk management and validation team aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions is estimated eg through developing alternative models if possible results of such reviews are shared with our banking regulators the market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior the market risk management and validation team will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to market data mapping var backtesting backtesting is one form of validation of the var model and is run daily the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue excluding fees commissions reserves intraday trading and net interest income for each day over the preceding year the most recent business days any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svarbased capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes when applicable we perform subportfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule using models approved by our banking regulators for interest rate credit spread and foreign exchange positions table start citizens financial group inc table end the following graph shows our
