citizens financial group inc table end competition the financial services industry is highly competitive our branch footprint is in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions though certain lines of business serve national markets within these markets we face competition from community banks superregional and national financial institutions credit unions savings and loan associations mortgage banking firms consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies money market funds hedge funds and private equity firms some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of products pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions including fintech companies to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has also intensified competition in consumer banking the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented toward technologydriven delivery systems permitting transactions to be conducted through telephone online and mobile channels in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial products and services the emergence of digitalonly banking models has increased and we expect this trend to continue given their lower cost structure these models are often on average able to offer higher rates on deposit products than retail banking institutions with a traditional branch footprint the primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates fees charged tailored value propositions to different customer segments customer service levels convenience including branch locations and hours of operation and the range of products and services offered in commercial banking there is intense competition for quality loan originations from traditional banking institutions particularly large regional banks as well as commercial finance companies leasing companies and other nonbank lenders and institutional investors including clo managers hedge funds and private equity firms some larger competitors including certain national banks that compete in our market area may offer a broader array of products and due to their asset size may sometimes be in a position to hold more exposure on their own balance sheet we compete on a number of factors including providing innovative corporate finance solutions quality of customer service and execution range of products offered price and reputation regulation and supervision our operations are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination under federal and state laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending practices deposit insurance customer privacy and cybersecurity capital adequacy and planning liquidity safety and soundness consumer protection and disclosure permissible activities and investments and certain transactions with affiliates these laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders or other investors the discussion below outlines the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries changes in applicable law or regulation and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities cannot be predicted but may have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we and our subsidiaries are subject to examinations by federal and state banking regulators as well as the sec finra and various state insurance and securities regulators in some cases regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed and such actions may restrict or limit our activities or activities of our subsidiaries as part of our regular examination process regulators may advise us to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter we have periodically received requests for information from regulatory authorities at the federal and state level including from banking securities and insurance regulators state attorneys general federal agencies or law enforcement authorities and other regulatory authorities concerning our business practices such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business for a further discussion of how regulatory actions may impact our business see item risk factors for additional information regarding regulatory and supervisory matters see note in item overview we are a bank holding company under the bank holding company act we have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by glba as such we are subject to the supervision examination and reporting requirements of the bank holding company act and the regulations of the frb including through the federal reserve bank of boston under the system of functional regulation established under the bank holding company act the frb serves as the primary regulator of our table start citizens financial group inc table end consolidated organization and the sec serves as the primary regulator of our brokerdealer and investment advisory subsidiaries and directly regulates the activities of those subsidiaries with the frb exercising a supervisory role the federal banking regulators have authority to approve or disapprove mergers acquisitions consolidations the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions these banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law federal law governs the activities in which cbna engages including the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of available credit that it may grant to one borrower various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect its operations the actions the frb takes to implement monetary policy also affect cbna in addition cbna is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations the cfpb has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products by depository institutions such as cbna with more than billion in total assets the cfpb may promulgate rules under a variety of consumer financial protection statutes including the truth in lending act the electronic funds transfer act and the real estate settlement procedures act tailoring of prudential requirements in october the frb and the other federal banking regulators finalized rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions to implement the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act of egrrcpa amendments to the doddfrank act tailoring rules the tailoring rules assign each us bank holding company with billion or more in total consolidated assets as well as its bank subsidiaries to one of four categories based on its size and five other riskbased indicators i crossjurisdictional activity ii weighted shortterm wholesale funding wstwf iii nonbank assets iv offbalance sheet exposure and v status as a us globally systematically important bank under the tailoring rules we are subject to category iv standards which apply to banking organizations with at least billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for categories i through iii accordingly category iv firms such as us table start i are no longer subject to any lcr requirement or in certain cases are subject to reduced requirements table end ii remain not subject to advanced approaches capital requirements table start iii remain eligible to optout of the requirement to recognize most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital table end iv remain not subject to the supplementary leverage ratio v remain not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer vi are no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements vii became subject to supervisory stress testing on a biennial instead of annual basis viii remain subject to requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis and ix remain subject to certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements we discuss other elements of the tailoring rules where relevant below the liquidity requirements are described below under liquidity requirements and their stress testing requirements are described below under capital planning and stress testing requirements in addition the resolution planning requirements implemented by the frb and fdic are described below under resolution planning many of the provisions of the egrrcpa and other laws are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators the ultimate effects of egrrcpa and the tailoring rules on us and our activities will be subject to any additional rule making issued by the frb and other federal regulators we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes in law and any new regulations promulgated including changes table start citizens financial group inc table end in regulatory costs and fees modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the cfpb and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions among others financial holding company regulation the bank holding company act generally restricts bank holding companies from engaging in business activities other than banking managing or controlling banks furnishing services to or performing services for subsidiaries and activities that the frb has determined to be closely related to banking for so long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for financial holding company status financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities including securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and brokerage merchant banking and other activities that are determined by the frb in coordination with the treasury department to be financial in nature or incidental thereto or that the frb determines unilaterally to be complementary to financial activities in addition a financial holding company may conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible nonbank financial companies with afterthefact notice to the frb as noted above we currently have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the bank holding company act as effected by glba to maintain financial holding company status a financial holding company and all of its insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed as described below under federal deposit insurance act and maintain a cra rating of at least satisfactory see community reinvestment act requirements below if a financial holding company ceases to meet the capital and management requirements the frbs regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the frb to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements until the financial holding company returns to compliance the frb may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the frb in addition the failure to meet such requirements could result in other material restrictions on the activities of the financial holding company may also adversely affect the financial holding companys ability to enter into certain transactions including acquisition transactions or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith and may result in the bank holding company losing financial holding company status any restrictions imposed on our activities by the frb may not necessarily be made known to the public if the company does not return to compliance within days which period may be extended the frb may require the financial holding company to divest its subsidiary depository institutions or to discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company if any insured depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company fails to maintain a cra rating of at least satisfactory the financial holding company would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state capital the us basel iii rules apply to us these rules establish riskbased and leverage capital requirements the riskbased requirements are based on a banking organizations riskweighted assets also known as rwa which reflect the organizations on and offbalance sheet exposures subject to risk weights the leverage requirements are based on a banking organizations average consolidated onbalance sheet assets for more detail on our regulatory capital see the capital and regulatory matters section of item we calculate rwa using the standardized approach and have made the onetime election to optout of aoci as a result we are not required to recognize in regulatory capital the impacts of net unrealized gains and losses included within aoci for debt securities that are available for sale or held to maturity accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges and certain defined benefit pension plan assets under the us basel iii rules the minimum capital ratios are cet1 capital to riskweighted assets tier capital that is cet1 capital plus additional tier capital to riskweighted assets total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets and table start citizens financial group inc table end table start tier capital to total average consolidated assets as defined under us basel iii standardized approach known as the leverage ratio table end the us basel iii rules also impose a capital conservation buffer ccb of on top of each of the three minimum riskweighted asset ratios listed above banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios with the ccb taken into account will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income defined as four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income for more details see the capital and regulatory matters section of item in april the frb issued a proposal designed to create a single integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative assessment of firms capital plans with the ccb requirement details of this proposal are discussed under capital planning and stress testing requirements below although the proposal if adopted would change the way in which the minimum capital ratios are calculated firms would continue to be subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions as they approach the minimum ratios we are also subject to the frbs riskbased capital requirements for market risk see the market risk section of item in july the frb and the other federal banking regulators issued a final rule to simplify regulatory capital treatment for msrs certain dtas and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions pursuant to egrrcpa effective for us on april the final rule will change the individual cet1 deduction threshold for these assets from to eliminate the aggregate deduction threshold for these assets of assign a risk weight for any msrs or dtas not deducted from cet1 capital and assign an exposure category risk weight for investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not deducted from cet1 capital liquidity requirements the federal banking regulators have adopted the basel iiibased us lcr rule which is a quantitative liquidity metric designed to ensure that a covered bank or bank holding company maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario as noted above under the tailoring rules category iv firms with less than billion in wstwf including us are no longer subject to any lcr requirement the basel iii framework also includes a second liquidity standard the nsfr which is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon in may the federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule that would implement the nsfr for large us banking organizations under the proposal bank holding companies with billion or more in total consolidated assets but that are not advanced approaches bank holding companies including us would have been subject to a modified less stringent nsfr requirement although the nsfr has not been finalized it is expected that the framework for applying any finalized nsfr will be consistent with the approach for the lcr requirement under the tailoring rules finally per the liquidity rules included in the frbs enhanced prudential standards adopted pursuant to section of the doddfrank act referred to above under tailoring of prudential requirements we are also required to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for days under the tailoring rules the liquidity buffer requirements continue to apply to category iv firms such as us and remain subject to liquidity risk management requirements however these requirements are now tailored such that we required to i calculate collateral positions monthly as opposed to weekly ii establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits than was previously required and iii monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures than were previously monitored we are also now subject to liquidity stress testing quarterly rather than monthly and are required to report liquidity data on a monthly basis capital planning and stress testing requirements under the final tailoring rules implementing the egrrcpa category iv firms with billion to billion in total assets including us are no longer required to conduct and publicly disclose results of the companyrun stress tests and are subject to supervisory stress testing on a twoyear rather than an annual basis category iv firms continue to be subject to the requirement to submit an annual capital plan that must be reviewed and approved table start citizens financial group inc table end by the firms board of directors or one of its committees at least annually as well as fr y14 reporting requirements in connection with the final tailoring rules the frb noted that it intends to propose changes to the capital plan rule including providing firms subject to category iv standards additional flexibility to develop their annual plans in february the frb provided relief to a number of bhcs with assets between billion and billion in assets including us from certain regulatory requirements related to supervisory stress testing and companyrun stress testing and related disclosure requirements for the stress test cycle as a result we were not required to participate in the supervisory stress test or ccar conduct companyrun stress tests or submit a capital plan to the frb for as required we submitted our planned capital actions for the period beginning july and ending june to the frb consistent with the frb authorization our planned capital actions for the four quarters ending june are largely based on the results for our supervisory stress test adjusted for any changes in our regulatory capital ratios since the frb acted on our capital plan we are required to submit a capital plan to the frb on or before april as noted above the frbs april proposal to create a single integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative assessment of ccar with the ccb requirement would if adopted replace the current static ccb with a firmspecific stress capital buffer scb requirement the scb subject to a minimum of would reflect stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the frbs supervisory stress tests and would also include four quarters of planned common stock dividends the proposal would also introduce a stress leverage buffer slb requirement similar to the scb which would apply to the tier leverage ratio in addition the proposal would eliminate the quantitative objection provisions of ccar but would require a bank holding company to reduce its planned capital distributions if those distributions would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer constraints based on the bank holding companys own baseline scenario projections the frb is reconsidering several aspects of the scb proposal including the fourquarter dividend addon the slb requirement yeartoyear volatility and alignment with the twoyear supervisory stress testing cycle for category iv bank holding companies as is currently the case under the proposal a bank holding company subject to ccar would generally not be permitted to exceed the capital distributions reflected in its capital plan either on a gross basis or net of capital issuances without prior approval of the frb resolution planning under section of the doddfrank act as amended by egrrcpa certain bank holding companies must submit a periodic resolution plan to the frb and fdic providing for the companys strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure we submitted our most recent resolution plan to the frb and fdic in december however in october in connection with the release of the tailoring rules the frb and fdic issued final rules which adjusted the scope and applicability of the agencies resolution planning requirements under these new rules category iv bank holding companies such as us are no longer required to submit resolution plans the fdic has separately implemented a resolution planning rule that currently requires insured depository institutions of billion or more in total assets such as cbna to periodically submit a resolution plan in april the fdic released an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding potential changes to its resolution planning requirements for insured depository institutions such as cbna and the next round of insured depository institution resolution plan submissions will not be required until the rulemaking process is complete cbna submitted its most recent resolution plan to the fdic in july standards for safety and soundness the fdia requires the frb occ and fdic to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions including cbna the agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines that set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired if an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans if after being notified to submit a compliance plan an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the fdia see federal deposit insurance act below if an institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties table start citizens financial group inc table end federal deposit insurance act the fdia requires among other things that the federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements as described above in capital the fdia sets forth the following five capital categories wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized a depository institutions capital category depends upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation the federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized with the actions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institutions capital category under existing rules an institution that is not an advanced approaches institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a cet1 ratio of at least a tier capital ratio of at least a total capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least the fdias prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies the frbs regulations applicable to bank holding companies separately define well capitalized for bank holding companies to require maintaining a tier capital ratio of at least and a total capital ratio of at least as described above under financial holding company regulation a financial holding company that is not wellcapitalized and wellmanaged or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose financial holding company status as of december the parent company and cbna were wellcapitalized the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the banks normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is wellcapitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is adequately capitalized and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates the fdia imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is wellcapitalized deposit insurance the fdia requires cbna to pay deposit insurance assessments fdic assessment rates for large institutions are calculated based on one of two scorecards one for most large institutions that have more than billion in assets and another for highly complex institutions that have over billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over billion in assets each scorecard has a performance score and a lossseverity score that are combined to produce a total score which is translated into an initial assessment rate in calculating these scores the fdic utilizes the camels ratings and forwardlooking financial measures to assess an institutions ability to withstand assetrelated stress and fundingrelated stress the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard the total score is then translated to an initial base assessment rate on a nonlinear sharplyincreasing scale the deposit insurance assessment is calculated based on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period deposit insurance assessments are also affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the deposit insurance fund dif the fdia established a minimum reserve ratio of the dif of prior to september and thereafter as of september the reserve ratio of the dif reached dividends various federal statutory provisions and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay our payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to the oversight of the frb in particular the frb reviews the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large bank holding company based on capital plans submitted as part of the ccar process and on the results of stress tests as discussed above in addition to other limitations our ability to make any capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases is contingent on the frbs nonobjection to such planned distributions included in our submitted capital plan or the frbs authorization to make distributions if we are exempt from the requirement to submit a capital plan see capital and capital planning and stress testing requirements above dividends payable by cbna as a national bank subsidiary are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current years net table start citizens financial group inc table end income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entitys undivided profits generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements that provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings support of subsidiary bank under section of the doddfrank act which codifies the frbs longstanding source of strength doctrine the parent company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for our depository institution subsidiary the statute defines source of financial strength as the ability to provide financial assistance in the event of the financial distress at the insured depository institution the frb may require that the parent company provide such support at times even when the parent company may not have the financial resources to do so or when doing so may not serve our interests or those of our shareholders or creditors in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment transactions with affiliates and insiders sections and of the federal reserve act and related frb rules including regulation w restrict cbna from extending credit to or engaging in certain other transactions with the
