relatively consistent with this year which will offset the impact on nim of the feds rate cuts we see a stable to modest rise in nim over the course of the year starting in  our fee growth should continue to outpace peers given the investments weve made and our expanding customer base and while we continue to make growth investments we nonetheless are targeting a modest level of positive

financial group inc rhode island great and thanks bruce and good morning everyone were pleased to report solid results this quarter and a strong finish to the year with record fee income good expense discipline and steady execution against our strategic initiatives we are wellpositioned for a successful given our consistent track record of disciplined execution let me kick off by covering important highlights of our underlying results covered on pages through for the full year our eps was up with ppnr up despite a challenging yield curve backdrop a key driver was fee income growth of with record results across each of our major fee income businesses as weve continued to expand our capabilities organically and through disciplined strategic acquisitions we also continued to maintain good underlying expense discipline we leveraged the benefits of our top programs to fund investments to drive future revenue growth for the quarter eps growth was up yearover year this reflects relatively stable net interest income as interestearning asset growth helped offset the impact of a decline in net interest margin we also generated record fee income in the fourth quarter of nearly million up yearoveryear highlighted by continued strength in mortgage and wealth and record revenues in capital markets and fx and irp we continue to strengthen and diversify our business model and the results are evident we delivered strong deposit growth of yearoveryear with growth across all categories our spot ldr was leaving us well positioned as we enter on a linked quarter basis net interest income was relatively stable with good loan growth in the quarter and decelerating pressure on margin importantly we continue to manage our deposit costs well bringing interest bearing deposit costs down to basis points during the quarter we remain highly disciplined on expenses and continue to execute extremely well in our top programs we delivered pretax run rate benefits of about million for top which is above our initial estimates for the program and our transformational top program is well underway with a target of approximately million to million in pretax run rate benefits by the end of ill spend a few minutes on that and some of our strategic revenue initiatives shortly overall credit quality remains strong across retail and commercial and both the nonperforming loan ratio and the allowance coverage ratio showed nice improvement linked quarter and yearoveryear we delivered rotce of and tangible book value per share was up yearoveryear to on page net interest income was relatively stable linked quarter as a pickup in loan growth offset a basis point decrease in net interest margin this reflects the impact of lower rates and higher prepayments on asset citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 yields partially offset by the benefit of improved asset mix and deposit pricing discipline on a yearoveryear basis net interest income was down as our loan growth of helped to largely offset the impact of a 19basis point decline in net interest margin to given rates on a positive note we lowered funding costs by basis points reflecting the improved funding mix from deposit growth and the benefit of lower rates in the face of the shifting rate environment and related balance sheet dynamics we are actively managing our asset sensitivity which remained broadly stable at around a impact to a gradual basis point rise in rates with about of this exposure tied to longer rates moving to fees on slide our feebased businesses continued to perform very well reflecting the significant progress we are making in strengthening and expanding our capabilities which is helping to further diversify our revenue this includes our mortgage banking and wealth management businesses on the consumer side and capital and global markets in commercial noninterest income hit record levels at nearly million for the quarter and was up yearoveryear as our fee income ratio improved points to noninterest income was relatively stable linked quarter as record results in capital markets and foreign exchange and interest rate products offset lower mortgage banking revenue which as expected declined from record third quarter levels capital market fees were up million linked quarter as loan syndication fees were higher with strong volumes leading to a record number of leadleft transactions which increased yearoveryear ma advisory fees were also higher reflecting a strong contribution from bowstring which we acquired early last year we also continue to gain traction in underwriting fees foreign exchange and interest rate product revenues also reached record levels and were up million linked quarter driven by increased client activity as sentiment improved with these easing trade tensions as well as a benefit from cba wealth management posted a solid performance with trust and investment services fees up sequentially as market conditions improved mortgage banking fees were lower by million from record third quarter levels reflecting the impact of higher long term rates and seasonality on originations which contributed to a million reduction in production revenue in addition msr valuation hedging results declined by million from higher levels in the third quarter providing a partial offset in mortgage servicing fees up million driven by growth in the servicing portfolio which increased by sequentially to over billion as well as by lower amortization expense turning to page noninterest expense was down million or linked quarter excluding the impact of the lease transaction in noninterest expense was relatively stable and demonstrates our ongoing efforts to improve efficiency we continue to utilize savings from our top programs to reinvest in revenue generating opportunities salary and employee benefits were down reflecting the impact of our efficiency programs as well as lower incentive compensation outside services expense was up sequentially largely reflecting the impact of higher retail loan origination activity and seasonality yearoveryear our noninterest expense was up or before the impact of acquisitions reflecting our funding of growthoriented investments lets move on to page and discuss core loan trends average loans were up linked quarter with a modest drag from balance sheet optimization initiatives as we move billion of nonrelationship mortgage loans to heldforsale late in the quarter average loans were up before the impact of this loan sale activity on a linked quarter basis commercial loans were up as we continue to execute well against our geographic product and clientfocused expansion strategies partially offset by planned reductions in commercial leasing retail loans were up linked quarter and up before the impact of the loan sales activity given growth in mortgage education and merchant partnerships yearoveryear average loans were up and adjusting for the impact of loan sales activity were up with growth in commercial and growth in retail overall period end loans were up linked quarter providing some momentum for first quarter loan growth citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 moving to page we saw nice deposit growth of linked quarter and yearoveryear as we benefited from investments weve made over the past several years to expand and enhance our capabilities our dda growth was on a linkedquarter basis and relatively stable yearoveryear which compares favorably to industry trends additionally our citizens access digital platform which reached billion in deposits at the end of the quarter continues to contribute to our funding diversification and the optimization of our deposit base given the rate environment we continue to aggressively execute our deposit playbook to manage down our deposit costs across all channels reducing cd rates retail market promo rates and taking down the savings rate in our digital bank weve also been reducing rates for commercial clients where it makes sense as a result our total deposit costs were well controlled down basis points linkedquarter a nice improvement from the basispoint decrease last quarter this includes the benefit of interestbearing deposit costs which were down basis points linked quarter next lets move to page and cover credit which continues to look quite good overall across retail and commercial nonperforming loans decreased linked quarter and yearoveryear and the npl ratio of basis points improved basis points linked quarter and basis points yearoveryear net chargeoffs came in at basis points in the quarter up modestly linked quarter reflecting seasonally higher losses in auto and expected seasoning in other retail partially offset by modestly lower commercial losses provision for credit losses of million was up from the prior quarter largely driven by continued seasoning in retail growth portfolios our allowance to loans coverage ratio remained relatively stable ending the quarter at basis points while our npl coverage ratio improved to up from linked quarter and versus a year ago on page we maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions ending the quarter with a cet1 ratio of which compares well with peers during the fourth quarter we repurchased million shares of common stock and including common dividends returned million to shareholders for the year we repurchased a total of million shares and including common dividends returned billion to shareholders up from going forward we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of about to lets move to page and discuss cecl on the slide we have provided some highlevel information about our methodology and the key macroeconomic variables that are drivers of the outcomes we still expect the day one impact of cecl on our reserves will be an increase in the to range which represents about to basis points on cet1 on a fully phasedin basis or approximately a to 6basispoint impact starting in this range considers the current economic outlook and mix and credit characteristics of the portfolio ultimately the amount of the initial impact will reflect our view of the macroeconomic outlook and some finetuning of our reserve models so we plan to provide you with the final number when we issue our 10k in february our estimated day two impact results in provision expense in the range of million to million with expected chargeoffs in the million to million range let me note that under cecl quarterly volatility of provision could be potentially higher due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast and the mix of loan growth and runoff on page i want to highlight a few exciting things that are happening across our bank first forbes ranked us second among financial institutions and 16th overall on their list of americas best employers for new graduates we are really proud of that because it shows that we are doing a good job of developing young talent and its a reflection of all the exciting things we are doing as we build a topperforming bank we also announced citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 the second year of our leadershiplevel national partnership with feeding america to combat hunger and this is just one of the important things we do to help people in the communities we serve since our last call we have now launched an exciting new merchant partnership program with microsoft for their xbox all access program which is distributed through amazon we are really excited about this program and our opportunity to partner with great merchants to help build deep and lasting relationships with our customers we are also hitting on all cylinders with the work weve done to expand our fee businesses and build out our capabilities we have virtually completed the integration of our franklin american mortgage acquisition which again saw very strong results this quarter with strong originations and improved yearoveryear sales margins and in the commercial business we are very happy with our progress moving up the syndication lead tables coming in at number three for middle market and increasing our number of leadleft transactions weve also been enhancing our capital and global markets capabilities building our ma advisory business and client hedging capabilities and both of these businesses saw record results this quarter also in our treasury solutions business this quarter we completed the client migration to accessoptima our bestinclass cash management platform on page let me provide you with an update on the progress were making and our expectations for the top program the top programs have been instrumental in driving efficiencies that allow us to selffund the investments and continue to deliver future growth overall we expect to deliver million to million in pre tax run rate benefits by yearend with about million to million of that coming by yearend our top program consists of two parts the first being the transformational program which is designed to transform how we operate and deliver for our customers and colleagues ill give you a few examples of what were doing we aim to deliver a more customercentric efficient and agile environment by modernizing our it practices and our crossorganization operating model this it work will further modernize our infrastructure and platforms and transform our technology delivery approach we are accelerating migration to the cloud utilizing data and artificial intelligence more ambitiously and digitizing endtoend processes we are converting ourselves to an agile company over the next to months this will make a huge difference in terms of the speed to market for everything we do and will significantly enhance our ability to innovate adapt and deliver for customers the second part of the top program is a more traditional improvement program similar to those that weve successfully executed over the last five years on the efficiency side we are accelerating our retail network transformation modernizing our branches and rationalizing our footprint to better serve and advise customers we are looking at ways to simplify our organizational and improve the way our back office operations support the business and work more efficiently cost to implement the program are estimated to increase to approximately million over the course of the year so we will look for strategy to offset these notable items as weve done in the past importantly the benefits of top will have to mitigate the impact of the rate environment and ensure we maintain our commitment to delivering operating leverage and improving our efficiency and the way we run the bank moving to page we expect to utilize some savings from the top program to fund the strategic revenue opportunities we are going after for example we are looking to significantly expand digital strategies across the bank to reach more customers we plan to expand the products that offer through citizens access to further citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 extend our national reach beyond our branch footprint our first wave of additional products should launch by late this year we are also planning to launch a new commercial customer digital offering we envision developing a simple integrated selfservice and fully digital platform to serve small businesses and lower middle market customers with tools to help them run their businesses better and enable frictionless deposit and lending capabilities another example is our effort to leverage the success weve had with our merchant finance partnerships to enhance the payment experience at pointofsale while helping customers responsibly make larger ticket purchases taken together these revenue opportunities would require roughly million investment in about of which would be in capex if executed well the investment should really benefit our mediumterm revenue growth and provide about a booster rotce by moving to page looking ahead we are very optimistic about the coming year and the opportunity we have to continue building a topperforming bank that delivers for all stakeholders the capabilities we have built and that have delivered success from the ipo up till now give us the confidence that we can sustain our progress into the future we have a strong customerfocused culture and an experienced board and management team we have a proven ability to execute and a commitment to excellence that will propel us going forward additionally we have demonstrated strong execution on our enterprise initiatives such as our top programs which are quite differentiating and demonstrates a mindset of continuous improvement we also have made good progress on balance sheet optimization as we have developed initiatives for both sides of the balance sheet to further build capabilities and optimize our position we also continue to make important investments in our future were thinking about the longterm making good decisions about how to prioritize where we spend money and balancing that with the need to deliver progress near term as we look out into the mediumterm we remain committed to our rotce target of to the details in the appendix clearly weve had to contend with the changed rate environment so its taking longer but we remain confident in our ability to deliver given a reasonable environment on page we review our performance against the guidance we provided at the start of the year and despite a pretty dramatic shift in the rate environment from the beginning of the year we executed well across our targets and delivered overall in the bottom line keys to this overall performance were delivering strong fee revenue reflecting our initiatives to expand feebased capabilities delivering solid loan growth in areas with attractive riskadjusted return profiles and maintaining strong expense discipline and stable credit quality all while returning significant capital to shareholders now turning to our outlook for on page we expect modest nii growth of around to as the benefit of to loan growth is partially offset by the impact of lower rates relative to a year ago given our current expectation for the fed to remain on hold through the end of the year we expect net interest margin to be down in line with results as pressure on loan yields is partially offset by improvements in deposit pricing we expect to continue to leverage our more diversified business model and enhance capabilities to deliver non interest income growth in the range of to we also will target modest positive operating leverage in the basis points range and a stable efficiency ratio by maintaining good expense discipline while continuing to make important investments to drive future revenue growth citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 we expect underlying credit quality to remain wellcontrolled and we currently expect provision expense under cecl to be in the range of million to million with chargeoff in the range of million to million we expect our cet1 to end the year in the to range with a dividend payout ratio towards the upper end of our to target let me note that this outlook does not include notable items we expect those costs to be in the range of approximately million over the course of the year our outlook for the first quarter on page reflects historical seasonality for first quarter revenues and expenses we are expecting net interest income to be up slightly as loan growth and a stable to slightly up net interest margin are partially offset by a million impact from day count the fee income outlook for the quarter reflects seasonal trends resulting in a midsingle digit increase from strong fourth quarter levels that said pipelines in our fee businesses look good early in the quarter noninterest expense is expected to be up in the low single digits largely given seasonal payroll tax and compensation impacts the provision is expected to be modestly higher in the million to million range finally we expect the tax rate to remain stable around the level and for the cet1 ratio to end the first quarter at around to sum up on page our results this quarter demonstrate our continued strong performance as we execute against our strategic initiatives grow customers and revenues carefully manage our expense base deploy new technologies and improve how we run the bank now let me turn it back to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you john brad operator lets open it up to qa citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question here will come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the revenue outlook seems little bit better than expected and better than some peers obviously fees is a big component of that could you just elaborate a bit on the drivers of fees you had a very good fourth quarter in cap markets mortgage the rates fx but talk about the kind of drivers on a fullyear basis and why youre confident in that high fee revenue growth thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure ill kick off john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and then ill kind of pass to you but you know matt i think its been a journey here on investing in our fee businesses and building out our capabilities and we have a growing customer base were growing households on the consumer side and weve up the number of accounts and clients we service on the commercial side so making that all kind of work in harmony so that those expanded capabilities can get delivered as we become a trusted advisor and provide advice to our customers were really starting to see the fruits of that so you could see that hit and accelerate as we go through and i think as we look into theres more juice in the lemons so to speak to squeeze on that so with that overview why dont i give it to john and then maybe don and brad you could comment on each of your businesses citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think thats well said bruce id say the outlook for if you start looking forward youd see our expected strength in both businesses and don and brad will comment but capital markets for example is an area of ongoing strength weve been making investments and capabilities there i think theres a balance and this is a little bit of a theme of organic investments being combined with the synergies from small bolton acquisitions that weve done over the last couple of years and thats evident in the ma advisory space within cap markets going forward weve made lots of organic investments in the global market space and weve had some record results here recently i think two quarters in a row in irp on the consumer side id say that mortgage and wealth are the two areas that i would point to solid expected underpinning in mortgage going forward given that helps to diversify some of our fee businesses and then in wealth the ongoing integration of clarfeld and the synergies there combined with the investments in the fa advisor space i mean our fa advisors were up over the year and as that the fullyear effect of that as you get into and the productivity that you expect in that sales force looks good along with maybe a more constructive mid to longterm rate environment which will help to relieve some of the pressure on some of the transaction revenues we have in the wealth space looking forward so all in we feel pretty good about the outlook for on fees bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island don you want to go on that donald h mccree a vice chairman head of commercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and ill just amplify a little bit i think john and bruce covered a lot of it but the other thing that i focus on is share gains we are as john said moving up the league tables nicely and all the relative league tables which says even in a market that was a little bit quiet like the syndicated loan market to a large part of the year we captured more than our share when were right up there with the big money centers at this point in that sector second thing id just point to is diversification weve really diversified out our fee stream so if you look back three or four years ago it was really a syndicated loan story on the capital market side weve built a nice a couple of nice equity partnerships weve built a high yield business out and when different markets are accelerating were able to generate revenues and the third thing is weve just hired a lot of extremely strong people on the origination and corporate finance side and i think were pitching really well in the marketplace and were winning more than our fair share of business so i feel very good about where the business stands and as john said i sit here today our pipelines look a lot better today than they did a year ago so were entering the year quite strongly bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island great and brad brad l conner a vice chairmanconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 yeah again i think you both did a nice job of teeing it up just a couple of things to add i agree completely with what john said on the wealth side i think we have a significant opportunity to leverage the clarfeld acquisition in we had good progress in a lot of that effort was around the integration work and building the right foundation i think were really ready to leverage and launch that platform in and feel really good about where we stand the integration and the capability we now have to serve the high net worth and ultrahigh net worth business and on the mortgage side certainly we may see the refi activity come down just a little bit in but we really think we can overcome that with significant opportunity in our thirdparty business as weve been investing one of the things that franklin american gave us was a diversified origination platform where we now have wholesale correspondent and retail capabilities and weve been making significant investments in all of those businesses around making the experience better investing in digital capabilities and we really believe that were ready to launch those capabilities particularly on the wholesale and correspondent side so i feel very optimistic on the mortgage front bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island great okay matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats a lot of color thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks ellen a taylor a head of investor relations citizens financial group inc rhode island operator bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island next question brad operator ken usdin your line is open with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc well thanks good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey guys on the loan growth side it looks really good especially even on commercial in light of the industry numbers that obviously dont look anywhere near as good and i know you talked about balance sheet optimization continuing underneath just wondering just how much do you see still when the uptake of your recent adds and your vertical expansions and what are you just seeing on the customer demand side underneath that to continue to propel especially on the ci side thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so why dont i take that i think its a tricky environment out there just because competition is really heavy and theres not a lot of huge demand for new money now with the trade first phase behind us im sensing already a little bit of more optimism in the client base but its way too early to really see it translate into the numbers i will say that our pipelines our originations and our pipeline for originations were as strong as they have ever been last year they were offset by a lot of paydowns so you saw a lot of working capital efficiency in the form of borrowers and you saw quite a bit of refinancing into the public markets and in the institutional market so theres lots of puts and takes in terms of loan growth what we are benefiting from is our geographic expansions we moved into the southeast this last year we moved into texas and california so we are adding new clients and that is generating an element of our loan growth i would say our core middle market has been relatively flattish and we expect it to stay relatively flattish so as we kind of go through daytoday its really picking and choosing our spots making sure we contain credit quality making sure we actually earn adequate returns on the capital were deploying but we actually like the volume that were seeing so i think our projection for this year is like low singledigit loan growth i will say that if you look in the underlying numbers we had quite a strong cre growth last year that was due to several large transactions at the end of the year which were purposebuilt transactions for large corporates which popped our numbers a little bit and made our cre growth look a little higher than we had expected it to be when were sitting here midyear bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island but very safe john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island great great credits we like the business yeah sure ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it great and then one question on deposits nice to see also citizens access still growing even with the change in the rate environment can you just talk about deposit pricing and just what happens now that we get to a point where hopefully rates are more stable citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go and jump in there and id say it this way i mean i think there weve seen really strong deposit growth i should hasten to add that were really proud of not only citizens access but also all of the organic work thats going on in the businesses to drive dda and other lowcost deposits i think thats been an area of real benefit for us over the last several quarters and that continues so thats very helpful in terms of the you saw our interestbearing deposit costs down by basis points this quarter youre just really starting to see the impacts of those rate cuts being takes a little bit of a lag to see that kick in i would say that we would expect to see continuing prices for deposit pricing come down as you look into the first half of as you get out into later in you could see some of that dissipate but we still see pricing opportunities as you look across not only our branch footprint but also with respect to online pricing as you head into the early part of ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right thanks very much bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay operator and well go now to the next question queued will come from peter winter with wedbush securities please go ahead ellen a taylor a head of investor relations citizens financial group inc rhode island peter operator operator instructions one moment here ellen a taylor a head of investor relations citizens financial group inc rhode island lets take the next lets take the next brad operator we do have him back here and his line is open bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc hi sorry about that consumer loan growth was particularly strong this quarter and the consumer overall is pretty strong would you expect consumer loan growth to kind of lead the growth in citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island im sorry could you repeat bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island the question is consumer loan growth has been relatively strong in the second half of the year do we expect strong loan growth as we go into john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and start off on that and bruce can add color but id say it this way more broadly we feel pretty good about the balanced profile of our loan growth into on both the commercial and consumer or retail side of things and i think thats been a strength of ours more recently which we were underweight in the commercial side and i think thatll help us as across varying environments with respect to consumer specifically within consumer again diversification is a good story there we see some strength in the resi side in the past and we see that continuing into but from a balance sheet optimization standpoint we see some of those portfolios that we really like from a riskreturn standpoint such as education and some of our merchant businesses really helping to drive some uptake over the next year as well and i should hasten to add that that helps balance exposure from a cecl standpoint also so it just looks to be relatively good momentum on both sides of the ledger there and ill stop there and see if brad wants to ph add on please brad l conner a vice chairmanconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah what i would add there i think is where you started john which is its well balanced and were seeing relatively strong demand across almost all the asset classes i mean you look at the fourth quarter we had good demand on the home lending side overall their education refinance product was strong were seeing really good momentum on the merchant side weve talked about this a couple of times already but the consumer just appears to be strong and were just seeing the demand i mean weve talked about running down our auto book which we have done intentionally but even there were seeing that become a little bit more attractive asset class as youre starting to see margins widen out a little bit so bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah yeah brad l conner a vice chairmanconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island overall just good strong demand bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i think its bruce and i would flag ed refi and the merchant partnerships as being citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 brad l conner a vice chairmanconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island absolutely bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island the shining stars as we head into brad l conner a vice chairmanconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island absolutely bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island where we would expect to see growth and its very attractive from a riskadjusted return standpoint we have made investments in our card business so i think well see some growth in card as well in mortgage were ph and i have note to sell that weve just announced that were going to try to call thinrelationship mortgages and recycle that capital so weve done some of that with auto well do some of that in mortgage were still fighting the trends in heloc so we still have a little bit of drag there so theres a few things that are going to be working against us but i think on a net basis well still have solid outlook for consumer loan growth in peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thats very helpful the margin outlook of stable to slightly up versus fourth quarter i guess thats assuming no rate cuts in and the question is what if the fed does cut rates and just put some of the puts and takes to the margin outlook john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and cover that id say as you mentioned the outlook for nim is to be up slightly given a couple of things i mean were seeing some stabilization on the loan front i mean weve had a lot of pressure on loan yields as the industry has and we see that stabilizing in the first quarter nevertheless we still think as i mentioned earlier that well see some benefit from deposit costs declining that along with the issue of day count when you go from to all of that would lead to uplift in the first quarter with respect to nim and we think that that can hold and possibly even kind of show some opportunities for improvement thereafter within now that said to the extent that theres a rate cut i mean we still are asset sensitive and positively and so therefore that asset sensitivity is around as i mentioned in my remarks and so we would have some negative impact to that and we tend to manage that through some of the hedging that weve done and what have you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 yeah and i would just add peter that the markets are not looking for any further reductions for some time and i think all of the public commentary by fed officials is that theyve eased and created looser conditions monetary conditions and they want to wait and see how that affects the economy and the data so i think were in the clear for a reasonable period of time before we really have to worry about whether there needs to be further reductions i personally think that if the economy picks up some steam here because of some of those easings and because some of the macro overhangs like trade tension and whats going to happen with brexit as those things have eased to me theres probably more of a upside breakout bias here than downside as we look in all things considered and so our feeling is that the next move might be up if were at these very tight unemployment levels and inflation is starting to trickle up you could see a scenario where the fed pauses and stays on hold for a long time but then ultimately feels the need to do some retracement up john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i was just going to add one other point with respect to a few quarters ago we shifted our asset sensitivity to the longer end in an environment where we think steepening is we have a bias towards steepening of the curve as well and so that to me is an important mitigant to any environment bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and i think historically when youve seen the fed go on pause the ph to10 spread has steepened usually in the range of basis points and so were still roughly at half of that and certainly that would create a little kick here to nii peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thats great thanks very much operator and our next question here will come from the line of scott siefers please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island morning john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 i think i just wanted to ask a followup on some of the digital offerings in citizens access so as you get more time under your belt and the volume continues to grow what are you finding about the elasticity or price sensitivity of that customer as time marches on john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island ill go and just ill kick off there i mean i think weve seen the betas in that space are pretty typical something in the neighborhood of to on the way up weve been able to retrace that as rates have come down i think more broadly though as we mentioned before this has been a homerun for us in terms of diversifying our funding sources and the pricing of it actually has been accretive to our nim with respect to being much better able to optimize our pricing our promotional approaches to focusing on deposit primacy and et cetera within the branch footprint so going forward we feel like theres pretty good pricing power there but the whole point of that platform is more of a strategic deepening with a customer segment that we find really attractive and as we mentioned in some of our remarks we plan to add to that platform later this year and are excited about broadening our approach to that customer segment bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think extremely well said i think weve learned that the betas behaved the way we would have hoped on the way up and yeah there is an affinity of these customers to the customer experience that were providing r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah brad l conner a vice chairmanconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island and were finding that theyre quite sticky when we raise rates as rates excuse me lower rates as rates come down so yeah we feel quite good about it donald h mccree a vice chairman head of commercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i was going to add that as well brad that i think we spend a lot of time designing the experience brad l conner a vice chairmanconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island exactly donald h mccree a vice chairman head of commercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island and making it really terrific for folks and so as long as were paying competitive rates i think theres no reason really for them to switch and then if we can come along with these rollout of additional products and have even deeper relationships that makes it even more sticky as time goes by citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect thank you and then maybe john if you could expand upon a couple of your comments regarding rate sensitivity i know you guys have taken some efforts over the last few quarters to moderate the level of asset sensitivity to where you are now i guess im curious for any updated thoughts on what the end game would be for in sort of stable rate environment do we want to neutralize the sensitivity or maintain some modest level of asset sensitivity how are you thinking about that dynamic john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think as you heard it earlier i mean we have a bias that the fed is likely on hold here and a bias towards the fact that theres some steepening potential in the yield curve that particularly given the recent events on trade and other factors in the macro so all of that said i think a low to moderate asset sensitivity position is a more durable expectation going forward as i mentioned earlier we shift some of our asset sensitivity out to the longer end so now were call it in the range of our sensitivity is really tied to longer rates and so little bit less volatility with respect to the moves on the short end so we think thats the appropriate positioning and i think thatll serve us well to manage the indiscernible issues going forward bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and one thing scott is that we are constantly running simulations and calibrating what the market expectations are and making adjustments to those hedges on a regular basis so we feel good about the kind of quality of analytics and the people we have running those analytics and you have to start with a view as john said and then you tail your position there but were constantly looking at well what if were wrong and what if this happens that we covered off different scenarios so feel good about the capabilities we have there r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect thank you guys very much bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay operator and next well go to erika najarian with bank of america please go ahead erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning erika citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc so the company has outperformed those results and outlook and its clearly reflected on the stock price performance i thought it was interesting that youve reiterated once again your mediumterm rotce of to consensus for both and has rotce of in the low and im wondering bruce and john if you could help us with a walk in terms of getting from to your medium term of from the in another words what is consensus missing in that they dont have even approaching that range over the next two years bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah well let me start john and then you can pick up but one thing erika that we like to highlight in the release is the fact that with the change in rates weve had an increase in the value of our securities portfolio which is a good thing when it comes to book value per share but it raises your overall equity and so the impact of that was basis points from where we ended up  to where we were  of so one of the things that could really help propel us back towards the which we had briefly touched in  of was it would be a steepening in the curve and i dont think analyst consensus i dont think people really go and model that and carry it through to what the impacts could be on oci so theres that element that i would just kind of lead off with and say if we got in a rate environment where the curve started to steepen and the economy stayed strong next year that would certainly help propel us higher i think beyond that then it really boils down to continuing to deliver that positive operating leverage and in a way i would say if you think about were still going through a period of transition to deal with the impacts of the fed moves in and theyll have an impact as you can see in the guidance and so you wont have as much operating leverage as youve had in the past youll have to fight the tape a little bit on nim so earnings per share growth wont be as much as its been historically but to me is a really really important year because we have teed up some very significant efforts we have top six and that positions us really well for the future in terms of how we deliver technology and serve customers and run the bank more efficiently and with that we have identified some really great opportunities we think that we can build on capabilities we have and really start to invest in these three strategic initiatives which are outlined in the deck which i think were duly cautious on how long its going to take to build those businesses and scale those businesses and we say that you look out in the medium term and theres a boost to our rotce coming from those initiatives and well work really hard to do everything we can to try to accelerate that so i think if we execute well through i think theres a fair amount of upside too if youre in a constructive environment and weve pulled through the top programs weve got some oomph behind these strategic initiatives that we could set up ourselves very well to get back to something where theres more operating leverage and a more rigorous rate of eps growth so anyway ill stop there and john you can add to that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah no that is well said id say just erika in terms of puts and takes on that i mean i think when we look out into the future we see opportunity for rotce expansion in a number of areas just to list a couple certainly in the nii space the way that were growing the balance sheet and how were going to use balance sheet optimization with more momentum there frankly to really drive rotce uptake i think is a real opportunity you heard about top i think our top program i think is differentiating its driving rotce improvement were going to invest some of that in the strategic initiatives which will also be as we mentioned possibly a point of rotce over the medium term and bruce mentioned the denominator oci and capitalrelated items that will be a tailwind i mean citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 i think all of those things we have good line of sight to there are some takes to that i mean i think credit although still quite good and strong i mean the things have you see credit getting not exactly fully normalizing but credit not being quite as perfect as it was a year or two years ago and the rate environment is also a little bit of a headwind to indiscernible build in so all those things together give us a lot of confidence in that statement erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc great thank you operator and next well go to line of saul martinez with ubs please go ahead saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning guys thank you for the additional color on cecl thats helpful i wanted to ask about your cecl outlook and maybe this is going into the weeds a little bit for an earnings call but john if i take the midpoint of your trueup range to i get to an acl ratio not an alll ratio but an acl ratio of about bps and if i forecast that out next year using your provision and your chargeoff guidance plus your loan growth it implies that that ratio is kind of flat to downish a little bit over the course of the year which suggest your net new loan growth has loss content thats similar to maybe even slightly lower than what your back book is so i guess my question is am i my thinking about that right because it does seem counterintuitive a little bit to me that youre growing and part of the story is that youre growing in the higher margin segments especially on the retail side which presumably should have a bit higher loss content over the life of the loan than your back book and i guess shouldnt we be thinking that your acl or your alll ratio however you want to think about it over time under cecl if that balance sheet optimization continues actually migrates upwards so i guess im just trying to think about the provisioning guidance relative to charge offs and sort of net new loan growth and the lost content of that under cecl john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah well thanks for that ill add a couple of points first as we mentioned were still working with finalizing our models and this is all new to the industry but we spent a lot of time on it and have some thoughts that we can share i will add more thoughts and talk about this further in future calls but so just to comment on your point i think what you have to do is be reminded of two important thoughts one is as we mentioned before we have a pretty diversified loan growth outlook so when you think about those loan categories that have lower cecl content which is the commercial space and call it mortgage and if you look at what our expectation is that commercial and mortgage are a pretty big part of what were doing from a dollar perspective because those are big portfolios and theyre growing at good rates so that drives a lot of dollar loan growth whereas the other portfolios that were growing from the bso standpoint that were excited about which is on the education and merchant front are higher percentage growth but theyre not theyre off of smaller basis so when you look at the dollars youre pretty wellbalanced from an outlook into from a cecl standpoint between those loans that maybe have a higher cecl loss content versus those that have a lower cecl loss content all that said charge offs arent affected and so thats maybe something you can think about when youre looking for that outlook saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 okay thats helpful so basically because its much bigger dollar value on ci and mortgage which may have a lower loss content it sort of balances out and it really doesnt change your alll ratio going forward is that sort of the thought john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island you got it saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then just changing gears a little bit on deposit cost and the outlook there in your nii guidance so far i think your deposit costs were down since the second quarter about bps on basis points of cut so already a beta whats kind of baked into your guidance for sort of the beta on the downside because youre assuming the fed funds rates stays where its at how much more in deposit cost reductions whats the sort of through the cycle beta that youre assuming john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i dont know if betas are quite as useful in a period where you think the feds going to be on hold i mean when you look at the in period betas as the fed doesnt which is our expectation the feds on hold but nevertheless we expect deposit costs to decline in the first quarter then youre going to have an infinite beta so im not sure the in periods make sense but in terms of the cumulative beta i think were getting up towards and may be able to drive that higher in terms of once since the down cycle began and its in the second quarter if you use that as the base of so yeah i mean i think that as i mentioned bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island the other point you made earlier john is the farther away you get from the fed pausing then the less opportunity there is so were still going to see some of that in  and then that will start to add as we get through the year john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island exactly id say we still see opportunities to continue to cause deposit pricing to come down and then the ongoing throughout the rest of the year theres still balance sheet optimization activities to even consider whether theres some opportunities thereafter but it does dissipate as bruce mentioned so thats really the thinking the other thing id just add is that theres a front bookback book dynamic on cd for our term deposits that are rolling over that has been positive and certainly over the last half of and then we expect that to be a positive dynamic as you get throughout most if not all of saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it no thats helpful and the just to be clear thats under basis points and my question is more just on the basis points thats been cut already how to think about the deposit cost relative to that i guess the is on that basis points right citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes it is its cumulative on that were up to that and all those other things that we just talked about would influence that into saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks a lot bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thank you operator and next well go to the line of brian foran with autonomous please go ahead brian foran q analyst autonomous research hi most of my questions have been asked but one that comes up sometimes is merchant partnerships obviously been very successful and a really good initiative for you one concern sometimes investors bring up is what if a merchant decides to move the relationship so can you talk to how you make the relationship sticky things you do to add value beyond just providing the loan any contractual provisions you have anything like that for someone who might be worried about one of your partners moving over time brad l conner a vice chairmanconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah its a great question that we do get quite a bit listen i hate to be too motherhood and apple pie but the way to make them the stickiest is to provide great customer experiences i mean at the end of the day what were doing is were helping our merchant partners sell more product and we think weve done that in a very big way with all the partners weve had weve been ive even lost track three years or four years now with apple and we feel like we have just a tremendous relationship with them and that we provide a very unique customer experience that has been the entree for us opening up with other partners we do look at other things that we can do to deepen the relationships providing data back to those partners and so forth but at the end of the day it really comes down to just providing a unique and a very exceptional customer experience i think our partners would say that we do that well bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah brian foran q analyst autonomous research citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 thank you that was it for me bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay good operator and well go to the next line in queue just a moment here john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc just on the expense side just a couple of quick things there on the comp expense you had a good linked quarter decline in comp expense despite the strength that you saw in the capital markets and fx and other fee areas so could you just talk a little bit about what helped drive that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i will just mention that even though weve talked a lot about top really top from a more traditional standpoint has been kicking in as you get into the later part of the year and we went out with numbers that were smaller than the million that were communicating today so weve been able to upsize those benefits with respect to top and we tend to use those programs to fund investments we would like to make but also to maintain profitability and maintain our trajectory that wed like to see in terms of going forward bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island indiscernible came down just below so after franklin i think weve been up in the high ph continue to look for efficiencies john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay got it and then more broadly on expenses if the operating environment does get tougher than you think on the top line for next year or whether its rates or growth or whatnot can you just talk about your flexibility on the expense side john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 yeah i would say a few things on that id say we have a relatively big strategic agenda in those are we consider them to be critical to maintaining our balance of focusing on the short term and the long term and thats our outlook that said if something were to be if there were some stress that would start to be introduced into the system theres a significant amount of discretionary investments that we could moderate bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island slowdown in pace ph something like that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah exactly and so thats something that we keep an eye on and thats something that were in detail focused on on a monthtomonth quartertoquarter basis what our investment capacity is and that we would modify that capacity if things were to deteriorate john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay got it and then my last one is just on cecl can you just discuss a little bit if cecl in itself in the day two impact has influenced your willingness or your appetite to grow in any of the consumer areas where youve been growing thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think its not the number one issue i mean i think were trying to serve our customers were trying to invest in the markets that where wed like to play and we have a very diversified consumer and commercial lending platform such that as i mentioned earlier a lot of the way cecl impacts some portfolios much worse than maybe some others tends to be mitigated through that diversification so we really focus on providing that capability and its something well think about i mean it is an additional capital charge to some portfolios and well just make it part of our balance sheet optimization activities going forward bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would say john at the end of the day its the economics that were concerned about and so we dont want to withdraw capital because of an accounting issue but having said that where we will look at the new accounting framework and if theres tweaks that we need to make to a certain product offering so it could end up with a better capital treatment well do that but id say fundamentally were going to continue to follow the economics john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thanks bruce thanks john bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah operator and next well go to ken zerbe with morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks two questions the first one in the press release you had mentioned that you have several portfolio actions that are expected to boost nim and rotce that those are under consideration are those already included in your financial targets for or these are part of your top program or are these in addition to what youve already announced bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island these ken would be incremental so id say were running hard with our balance sheet optimization and were constantly trying to develop new ideas and approaches and say in an environment where its hard to make huge progress in the nearterm on rotce for the industry there are certain things we could do to reposition part of the balance sheet that could create some upward momentum there so stay tuned on that were not making any promises but we wanted to socialize the idea that were looking at some things and obviously we try to do them in a capitalefficient and capitalneutral way so thats kind of the trick of it ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc and would these be considered more sort of incremental like maybe basis points in rotce or something more material bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island too early to tell too early to tell i dont think it would be massive but if theyre worth doing they should have some visible impact but im not going to say theyll be massive by any stretch ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it understood okay and then my second question just in terms of your ce tier targets obviously it looks like your mediumterm targets matched largely your targets i mean is it fair to assume that once were into and certainly into that capital return becomes a much smaller piece of your overall sort of roe or how you think about i guess the capital return could be a lot lower than what it was in years past i mean obviously i know youre doing a lot to bring down your ce tier ratio by basis points per year and it seems at this point its going to be a function of your roe rather than excess capital return is that the right way to think about it bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 yeah id say look were still looking to be friendly to shareholders in terms of our capital return but increasingly were going to look to the organic growth and where were allocating our capital to drive earnings performance and so i do think more will come from the numerator in getting to that with the exception potentially of the oci impact from a steeper curve but well still look to i think prioritize organic growth and having a strong dividend payout ratio and if we have capital after that well return it to shareholders but i still think that can still be a pretty good payout ratio going forward it just wont have the same kick and tailwind that its had as weve been on the glide path for the last four or five years ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah operator and next well go to gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning bruce good morning john bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi gerard john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc don can you share with us youve had success growing your portfolio in the new markets that youve pointed to earlier can you share with us what kind of industries that youre seeing this growth in the commercial loan book and then second what are some of the strategies youre using to win this new business donald h mccree a vice chairman head of commercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island so a couple of things just to refresh peoples memory as we went into the new markets we articulated a strategy that we wanted to bank larger more financially flexible company so it is not a middle market strategy because im very worried about smaller companies and adverse selection so the credit underpinning is midsized companies the real driver of the growth is and i wouldnt say its any one industry its pretty much across the board but what weve done in each of the markets is hired people that have been longstanding senior participants with clients in those markets and theyre bringing clients with them because of their relationships and as we interview and as we talk to the teams we are very focused on who can actually individually move clients from bank to bank citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 and then if you think about disruptions that are going on in the industry per se theres a lot of clients that are looking around for other banks to work with them so id say its one who we hire two its the intensity with which were covering these markets and three its a broadbased industry strategy theres a fair amount of activity in the southeast which is driving a lot of it because were longer there in terms of presence on the ground texas is beginning to come in a little bit its not an energy strategy we have an energy team already we have for years and california is very early days and the other thing weve done is weve upgraded in the midwest and brought a new head of the midwest in because we havent been satisfied with the progress weve made in those markets gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then circling back bruce on capital or capital return i should say obviously you guys had a nice increase in the dividend today it looks like its about annualized now which is about i guess between and of earnings estimates is that the longterm kind of dividend payout ratio we should think about to or would you consider similar to some of your peers that are now talking about to dividend payout ratios over the longer term bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island look i think its important to have a good yield on a bank stock and so have a good dividend payout ratio so weve always aspired to do that when we took the company public and i think were getting it up to around and for now i think thats a good level to be at we still have significant organic growth opportunities and want to make sure were balanced in terms of how much we pay out and how much we retained to support growth so thats where id see it for now gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay i think we have were going on a bit here so maybe we have time brad for one last question operator sure thank you and that will come from brian klock with keefe bruyette woods please go ahead brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning thanks for letting me squeeze in i just have a quick follow up on cecl john i guess when you think about the to impact on the day1 grows up to the acl whats the impact on the commercial thats embedded in that so is there a decline in the commercial acl john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2020 yeah i mean more broadly were not really going out linebyline here but sure theres a reasonably large decline on the commercial side i think thats true for most portfolios you see out there given the way we handle incurred loss typically versus where cecl would articulate it and then thats offset by some of the portfolios that are maybe more longer duration on the consumer side brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so would it be similar to what youre seeing on some of your other peers that have broken out commercial versus consumer impact on day1 so is it going to be something similar to them john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island no i dont bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island indiscernible john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah we focus on our numbers but i mean i would say i mean i think that shouldnt be come as a surprise that thats really cecl when you think about lifetime losses if you have longduration loans youre going to end up with a higher charge for the longerduration stuff on the consumer side and then less on the commercial side and back to the balance i mean i think overall were not seeing a lot of big change in our outlook in in part because a lot of this stuff has been diversified across our broad lending base and so thats really i think one of the messages you could take away bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i think brian if you look at the industry and what analysts expected based on composition of portfolios and they had us kind of pegged in this range i dont think theres any big surprises so the folks who have more consumer loans have a higher bump to the reserve and the ones who have less obviously are lower so i think its playing out probably the way most analysts and investors thought it would brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah i appreciate the time guys thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay sure bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well im going to thank everybody for dialing in today we certainly appreciate your interest and
