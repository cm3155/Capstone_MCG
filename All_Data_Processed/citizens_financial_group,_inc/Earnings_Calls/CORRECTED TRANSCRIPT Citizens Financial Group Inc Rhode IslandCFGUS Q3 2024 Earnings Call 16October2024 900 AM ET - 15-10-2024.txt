bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks kristin and good morning everyone thanks for joining our call today we continue to execute well through an uncertain environment weve made good progress on our strategic initiatives our balance sheet remains strong across capital liquidity funding and loan reserves and our profitability has stabilized and is poised to move higher let me start with an update on our initiatives first the private bank delivered another terrific quarter we reached billion in deposits up from billion in  and our assets under management reached billion during the quarter we opened two new private bank offices in the san francisco bay area and we added a new private banking team to cover southern california we reached breakeven in august and september and expect to be profitable in  with good momentum entering next our commercial bank continues to demonstrate its capacity to serve private capital well for the quarter we were number two in the league tables for sponsor leveraged loan arrangements and we remain number one over the past months we continue to add quality talent to our coverage and our capital markets teams our new york city metro initiative continues to show nice growth we have yearonyear growth in households and growth in deposits we look forward to being a key sponsor of the upcoming new york city marathon as we continue to raise our brand profile in the market weve executed well on top achieving a  run rate benefit of million and were finalizing the details of top which should have a million plus run rate benefit by end of our bso actions continue to proceed as planned noncore reduced by billion in the quarter and we continue to use the liquidity generated to pay down higher cost funding like brokered cds we continue to execute actions in commercial to exit lending only relationships and were focused on our medium term plan to reduce our cre exposure with respect to our balance sheet our cet1 ratio is a adjusting for oci puts us at we repurchased million in stock during the quarter and our spot ldr was and our federal home loan bank advances remained low at well under billion we are not seeing much loan demand but we remain hopeful that should start to pick up in coming quarters our pl was impacted by the drag from forward starting swaps which commenced in july as well as some fees that pushed out to  nonetheless we did a good job managing expenses and credit is performing broadly as expected our  guide shows a nice rebound in both nii and fees leading to positive operating leverage in the quarter we expect credit to remain broadly stable and we will continue to repurchase shares for the full year we will hit most of our beginning of year guide with the exception of balance sheet volume impacting nii and a modestly higher acl build we continue to have strong confidence in our medium term outlook and weve added to the materials in the appendix to show more detail on our nim progression lots of uncertainty in the environment remains but we feel good about our capacity to manage through that and continue to execute on our broad strategy our strategy rests on a transformed consumer bank the best positioned superregional commercial bank and the aspiration to have the premier bank owned private bank we will continue to execute with the financial and operating discipline that youve come to expect from us citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 with that let me turn it over to john john f woods vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone as bruce mentioned third quarter saw continued strong execution of our initiatives and importantly we believe the third quarter represents a trough in earnings as new tailwinds strengthening fees and continued expense discipline will result in positive operating leverage prospectively we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity and capital levels and a healthy credit reserve this positions us well to continue to execute on our strategic initiatives which should help drive strong momentum in and performance over the medium term first ill start with some highlights of the third quarter financial results referencing slides and we generated underlying net income of million for the third quarter eps of and rotce of this includes a negative impact from the noncore portfolio which will continue to steadily run off creating a tailwind for overall performance going forward the private bank is making strong progress towards profitability reaching breakeven midthird quarter and we expect it to start being accretive to earnings in the fourth quarter our capital position remains strong with cet1 at at september or adjusted for the aoci opt out removal and we executed million in stock buybacks during the quarter we also maintained a strong funding and liquidity profile our pro forma lcr is which is well in excess of the large bank category one requirement of and our period and ldr is our acl coverage ratio of is down basis points from the prior quarter given that improved macroeconomic outlook and ongoing front book activity driving a mix shift which lowered expected loss content in the loan portfolio we increased our general office reserve to up from in the prior quarter now ill talk to the third quarter results in more detail starting with net interest income on slide nii is down linked quarter primarily reflecting lower nim and slightly lower interest earning assets with respect to nim our margin was down basis points to largely reflecting the impact from the increase in hedge costs as forward starting swaps kicked in during the quarter other nim impacts were largely offsetting moving to slide our fees were down linked quarter with seasonality in capital markets and solid card and wealth results on the heels of a very strong second quarter our capital markets fees decreased as deal activity slowed given seasonal trends and some ma deals pushed into the fourth quarter yearonyear however capital markets fees were up led by bond underwriting and ma advisory fees our client hedging revenue was down slightly as some clients delayed their interest rate hedging plans given the potential for a faster pace of rate cuts after the fed eased aggressively in september mortgage banking fees are down modestly given a decline in msr results net of hedging this was offset by securities gains we took in making adjustments for the investment portfolio our wealth fees were up slightly given growth in aum from the private bank which was somewhat offset by lower transactional sales activity we continue to focus on building out our wealth business in both our branchbased financial advisory activity as well as in private wealth where we are adding teams at our private bank office geographies total assets under management now approximate billion on slide we did a nice job on expenses which were down linked quarter notwithstanding continued investment in our strategic initiatives our top program is on target to deliver million pretax run rate benefit by the end of the year and we are planning to launch our top program which will target more than citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 million in run rate efficiencies by the end of we will provide more details for you on our next earning call on slide periodend loans are broadly stable and average loans are down linked quarter reflecting limited loan demand as well as continued balance sheet optimization we continue to run down the noncore portfolio to the tune of about billion in the quarter the core loan portfolio was up about million with solid contributions from the private bank and growth in retail mortgage and home equity on a periodend basis the private bank is making good progress with loans up about million to billion excluding the private bank retail loans were up about million reflecting growth in mortgage and home equity while commercial loans were down about million reflecting paydowns driven by corporates continuing to issue in the debt markets exits of lower returning creditonly relationships and generally lower client loan demand next on slides and we continued to do a good job on deposits in a very competitive and dynamic environment average deposits are broadly stable with periodend deposits down driven by the paydown of highercost treasury deposits tied primarily to noncore rundown this was partially offset by billion of attractive growth in private bank deposits our interestbearing deposit costs were up basis points linked quarter however total deposit costs were up only basis points while total cost of funds was stable dda balances were effectively flat linked quarter with growth in the private bank being offset by lower commercial we anticipate that migration of lower to highercost categories will drop off now that the fed has commenced the cutting cycle overall our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a very competitive environment our estimates indicate we ended the upgrade cycle with a terminal interestbearing deposit beta better than the peer average our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels about of our deposits are granular stable consumer deposits and roughly of our overall deposits are insured or secured moving to credit on slide net chargeoffs rose basis points to basis points primarily reflecting seasonal impacts in auto a decline in commercial real estate chargeoffs was offset by the resolution of several nonperforming credits in ci nonaccrual loans increased linked quarter primarily reflecting an increase in cre general office as we proceed with workout actions on a handful of loans we believe we are near the peak of npas as criticized classified loans have been broadly stable for four quarters and loans and workout get resolved turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide our overall coverage ratio stands at which is a basispoint decline from the prior quarter reflecting an improving macroeconomic outlook and better loan mix given the runoff of the noncore auto portfolio and lower ph loss content originations in retail real estate secured and commercial categories the general office portfolio was down million to billion at the end of the third quarter and our reserve of million represents coverage up from in the second quarter on the right side of the page you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level while rate cuts may be beneficial at the margin we continue to expect the sector to be challenged we believe our current reserve citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 represents a severe scenario that is much worse than weve seen in historical downturns so we feel the current coverage is very strong additionally since the second quarter of we have absorbed million of cumulative losses in the general office portfolio when you add these cumulative losses to the reserve outstanding this represents an almost loss rate based on a march balance of billion over the past six quarters we have continued to work down the exposure to general office with the portfolio down roughly billion over the last months to billion at september 30th given paydowns of about million in addition to the charge offs i just mentioned moving to slide and we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength our cet1 ratio is a strong which compares with in the prior quarter and if you were to adjust for the aoci opt out removal under the current regulatory proposal our cet1 ratio increased from to both cet1 and tce ratios have consistently been above the average of our peers given our strong capital position we repurchased million in common shares and including dividends we returned a total of million to shareholders in the third quarter moving to slide our strategy is built on a transformed consumer bank the best positioned commercial bank among our regional peers and our aspiration to build the premier bank owned private bank and wealth franchise first we have a strong transformed consumer bank with substantial wealth revenue potential that is set to drive further deposit growth while efficiently managing costs and we are wellpositioned to continue gaining market share in the important new york metro market next we believe we have built a leading commercial bank among the super regional banks we are focused on serving sponsors and middle market companies in high growth sectors of the economy our investments over the years in capital markets capabilities and coverage of the private capital space have positioned us well to take advantage when market activity picks up with the fed beginning to ease and fears of a recession subsiding the movement in our commercial client base is decidedly more positive which has us optimistic that well see a strong finish to the year and good momentum into and we are pleased to report that for the third quarter in a row our capital markets business sits the top of the middle market lead tables holding the number one sponsor middle market book runner position on a trailing month basis moving to the private bank im pleased to report that the effort is going very well and continues to gain momentum we are growing our client base and now have about billion of attractive deposits this is a billion increase from the prior quarter with roughly noninterest bearing also we are now at billion of loans and continuing to grow we recently announced the addition of a top private banking team in southern california and we have plans to add new offices in the bay area which adds to the offices weve already opened in san francisco and mill valley california palm beach and boston you should expect to see us opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities notably our private bank revenue grew to million in the third quarter breakeven by mid quarter we are on track that our private bank to start contributing to earnings in the fourth quarter and add meaningfully to eps next year citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 moving to slide we provide a guide for the fourth quarter this outlook contemplates a basis point rate cut in each of november and december we expect nii to be up about to driven primarily by a basis point improvement in net interest margin reflecting the benefit of swaps given lower rates deposit repricing noncore runoff and favorable front book back book dynamics partially offset by lower asset yields spot loans should be up slightly paced by private bank and commercial sponsor activity noninterest income should be up midtohigh single digits reflecting expected seasonal strength in capital markets our deal pipelines are robust and we expect to see a strong finish to the year we also expect modest improvements across other key categories noninterest expense is projected to be up about and we expect to achieve positive operating leverage net charge offs are expected to be broadly stable while the acl should continue to benefit from noncore runoff and improving loan mix our cet1 ratio is expected to be broadly stable with about million to million of share repurchases i call your attention to an updated slide in the appendix on our medium term nim walk which projects us to be in the to range in to wrap up we delivered a solid quarter in a dynamic environment with strong results in capital markets wealth and card and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected we are playing strong defense maintaining a robust capital and reserve position a high level of liquidity and a more structural longterm funding profile as we prepare for potential regulatory changes and any challenges the environment may bring importantly we are also playing offense as we pursue our unique multiyear strategic initiatives which will drive improving performance over the medium term we remain confident in our ability to hit our medium term to return target with that ill hand back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you john allan lets open it up for some qa citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you mr van saun ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the qa portion of the call your first question comes pardon me operator instructions our first question will come from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning everyone thank you for taking the question john i wanted to start up with a couple of questions both related to the margin progression and that medium term walk to which you alluded on slide as we kind of start to march upward maybe first in the immediate term can you sort of walk through the puts and takes that allow for the basis points or so of margin expansion into the fourth quarter and then i guess more importantly as we sort of start the journey upward and think about that next year or so it looks like that basis points of time based benefits is largely programmatic which all else equal would get us to like a million but of course the wildcards are like the timing of the ebbs and flows of the swaps and the rate based impact so maybe if you could sort of help i guess narrow the cone on the moving parts as we think about the next few quarters please john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure thanks for the question scott id say starting off with the fourth quarter i mean i think when you think about the progression there one of the drivers several drivers of tailwinds that were seeing first off i would highlight noncore which continues to contribute about basis points a quarter and so thats the starting point i think the second big driver is broadly the active balance sheet management fixed asset repricing and front book back book that continues to play out on will continue to play out every quarter going forward and thats a huge contributor ill offer up one of the highlights of the balance sheet transition as you get into the fourth quarter also relates to deposit migration weve had negative deposit migration throughout the cycle thats been kind of declining over time and were seeing late third quarter early fourth quarter trends that tell us that thats going to flip around to being more of a neutral maybe a slightly positive going into the fourth quarter and thats really significant for that to become less of a headwind that its been and given whats been going on in the past i mean i think broadly bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island just on the color on that let me just jump john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island in here john but we have the private bank continuing to generate very attractive deposits and theyve been growing well over billion and billion range the last two quarters so thatll be positively benefiting that mix and then typically seasonally in the fourth quarter well see an uptick in both commercial and consumer in terms of demand deposits so were counting on that as part of the equation john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island absolutely i think just playing on that a little further i mean i think we are slight the other big category we are slightly asset sensitive but based on the noncore and those balance sheet trends that we just talked about those are more powerful and are you got to keep in mind that the receipt swaps which have been a headwind are going to flip over to a tailwind and be a mitigant to our asset sensitivity going forward so theyll actually contribute into the fourth quarter and so one of the important things were also doing is being extremely proactive on down betas just taking all the learnings from prior cycles and what youve seen from our deposit portfolio where our deposit betas on the up are now better than peer average from what we can sell were flipping all of that energy and capability into the down beta management being highly proactive in the consumer side of things and on the commercial side most of our deposits there are the majority of them are beta anyway but were feeling really good about how were really counting on this transition to a down rate cycle and all of that when you add all that up that gives us confidence that were going to achieve that basis points and as i may have mentioned earlier the late trends and the early trends are very consistent with that trajectory so thats the i think the second there are similar themes but the second question was take me out to the fourth quarter of and youre right if you look at the million in youre at the basis points thats really time based and its just really baked in well get million and theres another call it id say in the neighborhood of 5ish basis points of benefit that we can really expect such that we can get in that neighborhood of nim in the fourth quarter of and the drivers are very similar the tailwinds related to the growing front book back book and when you think about our fixed loan portfolio and securities as that turns over under a wide range of rate scenarios which is more kind of focused on longer end rates where the year is going to end up in 5year rates we end up with anywhere from basis points to basis points of front bookback book benefit as that turns over every quarter so over the next five quarters thats a driver that we feel very good about our strategic initiatives on the deposit side with respect to private bank and new york metro continue to contribute and when you add all that up we end up with what we think is something nearing by the end of and we saw a lot of down rate protection on keep in mind weve got our our swap portfolio is largely intact through the middle of so we remain pretty well protected and slightly asset sensitive but all those other factors offset and give us a net positive as you get into the end of r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right perfect indiscernible citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island the one other thing i would yeah the one other thing is to the fourth quarter lift and then wed add to that target as well anyway okay thanks scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect yeah thats a lot of good color thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i guess just to bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc drill down on the net interest income coming in weaker than kind of you thought maybe a month ago was that a bigger fed cut and a little bit less loan growth and indiscernible on the positive trends that youve said is what we should expect from here or was there something else to throw out there too john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah id say we are slightly asset sensitive so basis points maybe a little bit more kind of than we expected but id say that the deposit trends in the trajectory of lowcost migration came down during the quarter but maybe a little bit less than we expected and so i think we got to the end of the quarter where we expected but the average for the quarter in terms of migration was a little higher than we were thinking but as i mentioned that is now flipping around and as you look at the late september early october trends that it was almost like the bell went off there when the fed pulled the 50basispoint lever we really are seeing that lowcost migration really flip to more of a neutral to slight positive and so thats really what you can see going into bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and then yeah on volume too i think we anticipated a little more loan growth that id say we had nice loan growth in the private bank but not maybe quite as much as we thought i think thats really just timing and as rates come down thatll continue to pick up similarly on commercial bank we thought wed see a little faster rebound in line utilization particularly on the sponsor side were starting to see that so again i think thats kind of on the come and should thats why we have an outlook in the guide that fourth quarter we should start to see slight growth in our spot loans even comprehending the noncore rundown citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then separately how do you think about operating leverage kind of more medium term obviously like net interest income is going to be a bigger driver dollarwise if we just look at fourth quarter to kind of frame it youre guiding to revenues up about versus costs up ph so bps of operating leverage but thats more driven by fees so just thoughts on medium term how much operating leverage would you envision john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think well talk more about this in january but i mean i think we have significant opportunity for operating leverage when you look at the net interest margin reflating to that to range provides significant tailwinds and consistent operating leverage over time well come back in january and frame that for you a little more in terms of what we expect in bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island the nice thing about the nim reflation is theres no real cost of goods sold in terms of impact on expenses so that pretty much drops straight through i think theres clearly going to be continued growth in fees led by capital markets some of the things were doing in the payments business some of the exciting developments in our wealth business but those usually come with payouts and investments on the expense side but nonetheless i think the positive operating leverage should be quite positive when we look out over that to period brendan maybe you could add a couple of comments brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island one other comment id mention on the private bank is just remember that the cost base that were working our way through right now is yeah fixed on the shortterm basis with comp guarantees weve given to the team so as the revenue grows were kind of earning our way through the comp guarantees so thats all straight positive operating leverage linked quarter where the revenue is coming without necessarily incremental expenses because weve essentially put that in and over time that will lets say work their way through the guarantee when we get the right scale theyll grow with further linkage together but right now its a straight revenue growth on top of a fixed expense base bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes good point matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator your next question will come from the line of john pancari with evercore your line is now open citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi bruce you just talked about the loan growth dynamics a bit and maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit more on your confidence in that youre seeing this inflection in demand here that should drive a modest growth in fourth quarter what is the bigger catalyst is it the rate cut is it clarity you expect around the election and then can you maybe help us think about where like the type of acceleration in overall loan growth that you expect you could see going into or as you look at thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah let me let me start and then im going to pass it to don and brendan to talk about their segments and their outlooks but were not calling for any heroics here in fourth quarter so i think the guide is pretty much derisked from needing significant step up in loan growth but it is i think worth noting that were starting to see things build a bit we said our biggest quarterly increase in the private bank and the pipelines looking pretty good so i think that will continue and i think there as rates come down folks are willing to transact and borrow i think its a similar thing in the commercial bank where theres lots of interest in private equity kind of starting to realize some exits and put some money to work so we see it by the amount of conversations that were privy to with clients but its starting to build but it really the dam has not broken yet and so i think well see that trend continue to flexed up with let me start first with don and then maybe brendan you could pick up second donald h mccree q senior vice chair headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think you said it bruce the leader in the clubhouses subscription lines where we saw some very strong growth late quarter and were continuing to see it into the fourth quarter and thats not really leveraged by us that were doing is just activity in the private equity space that were seeing build and weve seen a pretty nice utilization bump in that business we havent really seen it in ci yet but the conversations were having with our core ci clients particularly in the middle market with the economy kind of stabilizing rates coming down theres just a general level of confidence that the business environment is going to be better as we get into and that will result in more working capital utilization more investment in their businesses citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 and remember one of the things john said one of the downdrafts weve had against kind of core loan growth has been a lot of activity where companies have been refinancing in the public securities markets so weve seen stuff thats been on our balance sheet being refinanced been good for our fee lines but its put a little bit of pressure on core asset levels so we think a lot of that is behind us now so the net growth well see in the core book should begin to grow as we get into bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay brendan brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill quickly hit on consumer and then private banking on the consumer side i would remind folks that the pace of rundown on noncore is turning into a net positive so last year at this time we were running off billion billion a quarter and now were in the consumer book and now were in the million to million so thats the linked quarter rundown is slowing a bit and that will continue into the future and we look at the growth portfolios were seeing decent growth in mortgage and home equity and as rates pull back a little bit we expect to see a modest pickup in mortgage originations activity but as everybody knows the majority of the country is locked into 3ish mortgage rates and so our heloc business is incredibly well positioned weve got a real strength in that business where were at the very top of the league tables and national heloc originations in the super prime space and youll continue to see that grow and i believe that product it will be a main lever for us consumers as the economy gets more confidence in footing for consumers to borrow against record equity in their homes thats been built up over the last five or six years so we expect that to continue the other headwind moving to a tailwind is likely student in a modest way with high rates the student loan refinance product has been all but sidelined and now with the federal government now collecting payments again on that portfolio and rates coming back down we should see more late early year olds who have great credit coming back in the money that see value and restructuring their student loan debt so were expecting that to modestly pick up as we get into next year on the private bank side its a little bit of the same story rates pulling back should really put more customers in attractive place to use credit and right now were seeing a lot of cash transactions whether its on the resi side or businesses sitting on the sidelines and were hearing very strong feedback that as rates pull back theyll be more comfortable using credit versus just going cash temporarily on whether its an investment home or facilitating business growth given the high net worth an ultrahigh net worth profile of our customer base so weve got good confidence that the rate dynamic should drive a decent amount of embedded demand and as everybody knows weve also went to market very strong on the deposit side and weve been very focused on getting the operations up theres a progression here on earning the customers full wallet of do the day to day banking really well now theyll come from borrowing needs and then well build a dislodge wealth so theres a natural sort of earned wallet share gain that we anticipate getting as we get into next year on the private banking side that will be supported by the rate environment citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks and then the quick second one on credit could you just talk about the confidence i believe you indicated that youve seen you believe npas are peaking here at this quarter maybe your confidence there what gives you that and then also on the confidence in the broadly stable charge offs with the third quarter as you look at fourth quarter i know auto delinquencies were up pretty sharply yearoveryear so that would be beyond the seasonality so im interested in what drove that and then thoughts on the reserve going forward thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah maybe ill start and then well pass it around whoever wants to jump in feel free but yeah id say the big issue thats well known that weve been managing through is the general office portfolio and that one is going to its a multiquarter workout that has commenced in its with us all through itll be with us for a good chunk of and we think weve got our arms fully around that weve got very heavy reserves there weve got our best people working with borrowers to try to come up with mutually satisfactory outcomes but the timing of when you recognize the charge offs and when something might go npa moves around a bit and its not always in our control if a borrower decides to put a property up for sale then there are certain actions we have to take in terms of npa recognition or charge off recognition so this quarter we were on the low end of cre charge offs and we had a blip in cre npas but having said that the problem loan population that were managing is pretty consistent and so one of the things we take comfort in is when we look at criticized and classified loans across the board and commercial theyve been pretty stable now for four quarters so thats the big thing ill see don if you want to add any color on the donald h mccree a senior vice chair headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island no i bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island cre and then brendan donald h mccree a senior vice chair headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island anything on the delinquencies donald h mccree a senior vice chair headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island i think thats exactly right bruce i think that weve seen like zero surprises in our credit folks for the last four quarters and its playing out exactly as we thought it was going to play out and as bruce said well have charge citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 offs going through the general office portfolio for the next several quarters but its pretty much playing out as we expected we had a little bit of a blip in ci charge offs this quarter which was things that have been in the workout teams for literally five six seven years and they just happen to resolve this quarter so i dont worry a lot about npa moves what i focus on is the ph credit class levels and the fact that those have been stable the other thing were seeing in the general real estate area is not in general office but in general real estate theres a lot of liquidity coming back into the marketplace so its accelerating our ability to move down the overall exposures in the book which you know as a strategic matter is something that i want to do and were seeing nothing in the ci book and broadly that is disturbing to us at all its quite healthy from a overall credit standpoint brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah consumer is broadly normalized in precovid we were between basis points and basis points in net charge offs and thats where we are now and while theres always a little bit of puts and takes theres nothing that were observing in the portfolio thats making me lose any sleep and your question on auto a couple of comments one would be last quarter was on the charge off side was very low seasonally impacted but also we had a very strong recovery month in used car values so this quarter was much more just a reversion to the mean the other dynamic i would mention in auto its tough to read into published delinquency numbers even though our delinquency is relatively in check but when youre not originating anymore it takes to months for a vintage curve to build up to its appropriate steady state in delinquency so when you shut the spigot off on new originations its just a denominator issue that youve got other originations vintages that are normally progressing along their lines to our ultimate expected loss number and youre not getting the denominator benefit of a bunch of new flow coming in as zero delinquencies so when you decompose all that theres really nothing that were worried about whatsoever in the auto portfolio its performing exactly as we priced it and exactly as weve expected it to bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thanks john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thank you operator your next question will come from the line of erika najarian with ubs your line is now open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning my first question is for you john on the 10q you had billion of notional receive fixedpay sofr swaps for both and and billion for obviously slide would indicate lower notional could you give us an update on whether you terminated those swaps and maybe confirm the accounting citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 for the swaps in that you would just those losses are crystallized and they would be in your nii for the duration of the swap life and then just as a followup you mentioned a nim by how many rate cuts would you need to ensure yourself of getting to that level john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill take those so yeah i think during the third quarter as you may recall there was a period of time when the yield curve was discounting as many as seven or eight cuts over through the second quarter of next year is pretty aggressive expectation of the pace of fed rate cuts we happen to have about billion of shortdated receivefixed swaps that were maturing in may of and so what we opportunistically chose to do was to terminate billion of swaps during the third quarter in an environment where there was approximately seven or eight cuts that we locked in that benefit given the swaps were very short dated and really were only providing down rate protection through may we felt like that that was a good riskreward to lock in that benefit and lock in the contribution and protection against the lower rates that the swaps were there to cover in the first place out the window there are fewer cuts through may so at least at this point that was a round trip positive for us to move on from those swaps and they did exactly what they were intended to do was to create that protection the accounting aspects of it are that we amortize the impact of that over the remaining life of those swaps through may so thatll be amortized through but that impact will be again a lower impact or a more favorable impact than otherwise would be the case if we were to have held the swaps and so that was the point of the terminations so thats that one and i think the second question was about the bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island how many cuts john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and the rate environment that we would theres a range of rate environments that would still be consistent with that i mean i would say that we have a slightly assetsensitive position so net interest margin is stable across a range of rate environments into given the swap portfolio doesnt begin to drop off until mid2026 so i mean the forward curve out the window implies getting to around by the end of but we would be able to achieve that at rate environments that would be below that level as well erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my followup question is twofold first could you explain the more favorable impact i think i was thinking that as i amortize that impact of the terminated swap it would just be the difference between the sofr and receivefixed rate through may so john maybe give us some insight on what the more favorable treatment would be citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 and then just secondly just wanted to follow up i think that there were a lot of questions over being able to achieve that nim expansion for next quarter which youve explained well i just wanted to sort of nail down what kind of deposit beta you are assuming in that number for next quarter john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes so again so when you terminate the swap you basically terminate based upon the forward curve thats assumed at the time and so the forward curve at that time erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it thats the difference got it okay john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc understood john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and so yes got it and then the on the nim expansion into the fourth quarter highly proactive focus on this is going to get our deposit beta to be up to around nearing by the end of the quarter youve got all of the beta stuff in commercial leading the way but were being highly proactive in consumer as well and just really taking all the learnings over the cycle over the last many years and applying that to how we continue to be able to drive solid deposit growth at a really attractive cost of funds so thats the number thats baked in about deposit beta in erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks so much for the straightforward answers appreciate it operator your next question will come from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley your line is now open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i wanted to follow up on the deposit beta question do you have any more specifics on what your spot deposit rates are now that were a month past the fed rate cuts and how you expect that deposit beta to project as we get further into the fed rate cut cycle right as more fed rate cuts are behind us does that make it easier or more difficult to continue to drop your deposit rates going forward citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well i mean i think if you kind of do the math there if you based on the forward curve from the the forward curve that will have two more fed cuts in and were using a curve that was after nonfarm payrolls from a week or two ago but after nonfarm payrolls you got the two cuts based on that curve and if you apply a beta to what you think the average sofr rate would be in versus you can come up with the decline in interest bearing deposit costs on that basis and second question what was the second part of that question manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc the second part of the question was just as we get into say the middle of next year and we have the series of fed rate cuts behind us does that make it easier to continue to drop deposit rates or does it make it harder to drop deposit rates because theres fewer cuts in the forward curve from there john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i think the way to think about that is the longer the down cycle lasts the more you can continue to contribute to ongoing lowering of deposit costs but broadly i think what weve said in the past was that our down cycle betas are going to approximate our upcycle beta so around to and so were going to be around by the end of the fourth quarter and itll gradually migrate to that to over the cutting cycle thats going to proceed over the in the coming years and so you can kind of think about that gradual improvement in that way i think bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah but there was acceleration in the upcycle towards the later part of the cycle which i think you mirror that on the down cycle john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thats right exactly manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah thats what i was getting to thats really helpful and then maybe just on the front book back book i think you noted that basis point to basis point spread benefit can you talk about what balances we should apply that to what are the fixed rate securities and loans coming due over the next year or so and is there any room to use some of the excess capital for any securities repositioning from here john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think thats a good metric to use that this will be growing over time so when you see that the activity in loan growth picking up over time youre going to see this being a contributor over the next couple of years i mean id say that the what turns over in the back book on a quarterly basis in resi mortgage call it around million a quarter and thats a similar number for securities as well when you talk about what turns citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 over those are the balances that you would apply it to is the front book back book but thatll continue to contribute and build on itself over the next couple of years manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc thats where then would you do a securities repositioning from here is there any room for that john f woods a vice chair chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i mean thats not in our plans i mean well look at we actively manage the securities portfolio and on an ongoing basis but we dont have a large single repositioning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and i would also just point to the slide and some of the built in momentum that we have to raise nim so that the need to expend capital to shift the timing on that nim watch is not something that we need to avail ourselves of manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i appreciate it thank you operator and at this time you have no further questions in queue bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay great well thanks again folks for dialing today we appreciate your interest and support in citizens have a good day
