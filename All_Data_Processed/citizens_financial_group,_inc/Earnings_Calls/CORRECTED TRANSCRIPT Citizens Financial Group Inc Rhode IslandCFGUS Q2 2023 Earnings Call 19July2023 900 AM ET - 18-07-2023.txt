kristin and good morning everyone thanks for joining our call today the turbulent external environment continued in the second quarter but we continue to navigate well and we delivered solid financial performance in particular were pleased with the strong results we achieved around capital liquidity and funding our cet1 ratio grew by basis points to in the quarter and we were able to repurchase in excess of million in stock we grew spot deposits by or billion and our spot loan to deposit ratio improved to our federal home loan bank borrowings dropped by billion to billion and contingent liquidity grew by to billion for the quarter we posted underlying earnings per share of and rotce of nii was down reflecting higher funding costs in line with our expectations noninterest income grew slightly less than expected as capital markets saw a few deals pushed to the third quarter expenses were broadly stable as expected and credit costs continue to be manageable one of the highlights of the second quarter was the opportunity to secure a significant influx of talent largely from the first republic platform to meaningfully augment our citizens private bank and wealth management business while expense investments will lead revenues in we project the business to be accretive in and citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 significantly profitable in the medium term in our presentation this morning we will highlight this initiative in more detail and well also review several other compelling initiatives that we believe will lead to strong mediumterm outperformance execution of these initiatives continues to be strong were setting up a noncore runoff portfolio as a centerpiece of intensified balance sheet optimization efforts we expect around billion of loan runoff largely in auto by the end of this capacity will be utilized to fund more strategic loan portfolios to pay down highcost debt and to build cash and securities in parallel the private bank will grow loans over this period by billion which will be funded by billion of incremental deposits the net benefit of all of this is a better deployment of capital along with positive impact on earnings per share rotce and liquidity weve also included more detail on our cre loan portfolio our general office reserve is now at while we continue to see increases in criticized assets and chargeoffs in this particular portfolio we believe losses are manageable and readily absorbed by reserves and our strong capital position looking forward we anticipate that the environment while stabilizing will continue to be challenging our net interest margin will decline again in  given higher funding costs we expect our terminal beta to reach to at yearend our fees continue to grow sequentially expenses will be well controlled and credit should be broadly stable we will further build our cet1 ratio while continuing to repurchase shares overall were holding in okay on current period performance with midteens rotce in while making the investments to deliver a stronger franchise attractive growth and returns and a fortified balance sheet over the medium term we continue to build a great bank and we remain very excited about our future our capital strength and our attractive franchise position us to attract terrific talent and to take advantage of opportunities as they arise with that let me turn it over to john to take you through more of the financial details john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone let me start with the headlines for the second quarter referencing slide for the second quarter we generated underlying net income of million and eps of our underlying rotce for the quarter was net interest income was down linked quarter and our margin was down basis points with funding costs outpacing the increase in asset yields we delivered very strong deposit growth in the quarter reflecting the strength of the franchise with spot deposits up or billion periodend loans and average loans were down quarteroverquarter reflecting the impact of our balance sheet optimization efforts including our ongoing run off of auto these dynamics improved our periodend ldr to and our liquidity position remains very strong we reduced fhlb borrowings by about billion to approximately billion outstanding at quarterend and we increased our available liquidity by to about billion our credit maximum and overall position remain solid total ncos of basis points are up basis points linked quarter as expected primarily reflecting higher chargeoffs in cre general office we recorded a provision for credit losses of million and a reserve build of million this quarter increasing our acl coverage to up from at the end of the first quarter with the increase directed to the general office portfolio we repurchased million of common shares in the second quarter and delivered a strong cet1 ratio of citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 up from in the first quarter and our tangible book value per share is down linked quarter reflecting aoci impacts associated with higher rates on the next few slides ill provide further details related to second quarter results on slide net interest income was down primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin which was down basis points to with the increase in asset yields more than offset by higher funding costs given the competitive environment and migration from lowercost categories with fed funds increasing basis points since the end of our cumulative interestbearing deposit beta is through the second quarter which has been rising in response to the rate and competitive environment and is generally in the pack with peers our asset sensitivity at the end of the second quarter is still approximately which is broadly stable with the prior quarter our receive fixed cash flow swap position is similar to the prior quarter as we held off on adding further protection as rates continued to rise during the quarter moving on to slide we posted solid fee performance in a challenging market environment fees were up linked quarter the card fees showing a seasonally strong increase from higher transaction volumes and increases in wealth and mortgage banking fees fx and derivatives revenue was modestly lower capital markets fees were stable with market volatility through the quarter continuing to impact underwriting fees largely offset by increased syndications and ma advisory fees despite a few deals being pushed into the third quarter we continue to see good strength in our deal pipelines and are hopeful that deal flow picks up in the second half mortgage fees were slightly higher as production fees increased with market volumes partially offset by lower margins and lower servicing fees and finally wealth fees were also up slightly reflecting growth in aum on slide expenses were broadly stable linked quarter as seasonally lower salaries and employee benefits were offset by higher equipment and software costs as well as higher advertising and deposit insurance costs on slide average and periodend loans were both down linked quarter reflecting balance sheet optimization actions in ci as well as the impact of planned auto runoff education was lower given the rate environment but this was offset by modest growth in mortgage and home equity commercial utilization was down a bit as clients looked to deleverage given higher rates and we saw less ma financing activity in the face of an uncertain economic environment on slide periodend deposits were up billion or linked quarter with growth led by consumer up billion and commercial up billion our interestbearing deposit costs were up basis points which translates to a sequential beta and a cumulative beta strong deposit flows and a very successful auto loan collateralized borrowing program initiated during the quarter contributed to reducing fhlb levels by about billion given our bso objectives we grew deposits which drove a favorable mix shift away from wholesale funding as a result our total cost of funds was relatively wellbehaved up basis points next ill move to slide to highlight the strength of our deposit franchise with of our deposits skewed toward consumer and highly diversified across product mix and channels we are able to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in a rising rate environment we increased the portion of our insured and secured deposits from to linked quarter and when combined with our available liquidity of billion our available liquidity as a percentage of uninsured deposits increased to about from around in the first quarter as rates rose another basis points in the second quarter we saw continued migration of lowercost deposits to higheryielding categories primarily in commercial with noninterestbearing now representing about of the book this is back to prepandemic levels and should stabilize from here citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 moving on to slide we saw good credit results in retail again this quarter and higher chargeoffs in commercial net chargeoffs were basis points up basis points linked quarter which reflects an increase in the general office segment of commercial real estate partly offset by a slight improvement in retail primarily due to the strength in used car values nonperforming loans are basis points of total loans up basis points from the first quarter reflecting an increase in general office which tends to be lumpy its also worth noting that overall delinquencies were lower sequentially with retail and commercial both improving slightly retail delinquencies continue to remain favorable to historical levels turning to slide ill walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter we increased our allowance by million which includes a million increase in cre general office even after covering chargeoffs of million our overall coverage ratio stands at which is a 5basispoint increase in the second quarter the runoff of the noncore portfolio primarily auto facilitated the reallocation of reserves to cre the reserve coverage in general office was increased to a strong on slide youll see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level which we feel represent a fairly adverse scenario that is much worse than weve seen in historical downturns as mentioned we built our reserve for the general office portfolio to million this quarter which represents coverage of in addition to running a number of stress scenarios across the general office portfolio we continuously perform a detailed loanlevel analysis that takes into account propertyspecific details such as location building quality operating performance and maturity we have a very experienced cre team who are focused on managing the portfolio on a loanbyloan basis and engaging in ongoing discussions with sponsors to work through the property and borrowerspecific elements to derisk the portfolio and ultimately minimize losses our reserves reflect this detailed view of the portfolio as well as the key macro factors we set out on the page the property value default rate and loss severity assumptions we are using to set the reserve are adequate for the risks we currently see and are significantly more conservative than what we see in previous cre downturns its worth noting that the financial impact of any further deterioration beyond what we expect would be very manageable given our strong reserve and capital position on the following slide there are some additional disclosures we are providing this quarter to give more detail on the type and location of the general office portfolio you can see out of the billion general office portfolio is class a or b with a majority in suburban areas which seem to be performing better than central business districts on the bottom lefthand side of the page it highlights that the portfolio is quite diversified across geographies as well as the top msas listed on the bottom righthand side broadly for new york msa we are starting to see returntooffice trends picking up and more than of the portfolio is outside manhattan where property dynamics tend to be more favorable washington dc is class a and b and suburban moving to slide we maintain excellent balance sheet strength our cet1 ratio increased to as we look to add capital given the uncertain macro and regulatory environment we returned a total of million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends turning to slide youll see that our cet1 ratio is among the highest in our regional bank peer group this strong capital level reflects a relatively conservative approach since the ipo in maintaining robust capital levels if you incorporate the removal of aoci optout our adjusted cet1 ratio would be and we also expect that citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 this would place us near the top of our peer group again this quarter we expect to maintain very strong capital levels going forward with the ability to generate roughly basis points of cet1 ratio post dividend each quarter in before share buybacks so as you see weve been focused for a while on playing really strong defense with a focus on capital liquidity funding and maintaining a prudent credit risk appetite and thats been job one even long before the turmoil we saw in the first quarter but we also recognize the need to continue to play offense we need to be selective investing in initiatives that will grow the franchise where we have a right to win over the next few slides ill spotlight a few of the exciting things we are doing to make sure that we can deliver growth and strong returns for our shareholders first on slides and we were excited to announce a few weeks back that we have hired about senior private bankers and related support professionals who were with first republic as many of you know for a number of years weve had an interest in growing our wealth business both organically and inorganically so we made a number of investments on the organic side hiring financial advisors and converting that business from a transactional business to a very customercentric financial planning approach thats going to slow and steady build over the years and then we supplemented that with the clarfeld acquisition a couple of years ago and thats gone incredibly well so with our customercentric culture our financial strength and the full range of products and services we offer we were the perfect fit for these bankers we really admire their approach to delivering the bank and their customers in a unique way with whiteglove service this is really a coasttocoast team with a presence in some of our key markets like new york boston and places where wed like to do more like florida and california in fact we think the overlap with jmp in san francisco is extremely complementary these bankers serve the types of customers we are seeking to attract to the bank high and ultrahigh net worth individuals and families often with strong connections to middle market companies with a particular focus on private equity and venture capital firms serving the innovation economy we have a great deal of work ahead of us to integrate these teams and to ensure that they are positioned to deliver the bank and their clients we plan to open a few private banking centers in key geographies and build appropriate scale in our wealth business with clarfeld as the centerpiece of that effort we think this is going to be extremely attractive from a financial perspective these teams and their staff about people in total on boarded late in the second quarter with revenue beginning to ramp in the fourth quarter financial impact for the second half will be to of eps plus an initial notable cost of about for these bankers have hit the ground running and are out working to build their book of business and we expect the effort to break even around the middle of by we expect eps accretion of roughly with yearend projections of about billion in loans billion of deposits and billion of assets under management so overall a very exciting advance for us now lets go to slide and ill walk you through how well be managing our balance sheet over the next few years since the ipo weve prudently grown our balance sheet while managing the mix of assets and funding with an eye towards maximizing returns with the increase in rates since the end of plus the advent of quantitative tightening and more recently the heightened competition for deposits we are entering the next stage of the journey with a plan to focus on attractive relationship lending while lowering our ldr which will improve our liquidity profile and benefit returns citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 in order to make this effort clear and show the benefits we expect weve established a billion noncore portfolio which is comprised of our billion shorter duration indirect auto portfolio and lower relationship purchased consumer loans this portfolio will rundown fairly quickly with about billion of runoff expected by the end of moving to slide and youll see that as the noncore loan portfolio runs down this allows us to pay down highercost funding and redeploy capital into more strategic lending and our investment portfolio we will also be growing relationshipbased lending through the private bank and raising deposits to selffund that growth despite the size of the runoff portfolio we expect to see modest loan growth in picking up in driven by opportunities across retail and ci as well as our private bank effort the net result of these actions is an improved liquidity profile with a better loan and funding mix and higher returns next on slide a quick update on our entry into new york metro where some really exciting things are happening with the branch conversions behind us we have full steam ahead working to serve our customers and capitalize on opportunities we continue to be encouraged by our early success weve seen strong sales in the branches as we leverage our full customer service capabilities to drive some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network most importantly weve seen a steady improvement in our net promoter scores on the commercial banking side weve got a strong new leadership team in place with local talent joining from larger firms and we are seeing some early success leveraging our new visibility to build pipelines for middle market firms and we are looking forward to what we can do with our new private banking capabilities in the market on slide we have a great opportunity to build on citizens access our national digital platform that has been focused on deposits for the last few years weve moved to a modern fully cloudbased core platform and we plan to add checking capabilities later this year down the road we plan to converge our legacy core system with this modern platform we are confident that a single integrated platform will be more cost efficient and flexible in meeting our clients needs we aim for this to be a complete digital bank experience to serve customers nationwide with a focus on the young mass affluent market segment and on the right side of the page is citizens pay where we have been very innovative in creating distinctive ways to serve customers citizens pay has been the top customer acquisition engine for the bank with very high promoter scores and it has been a great performer from a credit perspective weve had some fantastic partners on the platform for a while such as apple microsoft best buy bjs and vivint and we are always very excited to welcome new partners like peloton trek the tile shop and wisetack to the platform on slide ill highlight how we are positioned to support the significant growth in private capital over the last several years private capital fundraising has led to record deal formation ma activity and substantial fees deal activity has been relatively muted recently and many sponsors have not deployed meaningful amounts of capital so there is a tremendous amount of pentup demand for ma and capital markets activity we have been executing a consistent strategy to serve the sponsor community with distinctive capabilities for the last years and weve done a great job moving up to the top of the sponsor league tables particularly in the middle market weve made significant investments in talent and capabilities including five advisory acquisitions since and our new private bankers significantly expand our sponsor relationships and capabilities our success supporting private capital has been a large part of our strong capital markets performance over the last few years and we are poised to capitalize on the next wave of sponsor activity as the path of the economy becomes clearer citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 lets move to slide for an update on our top program our latest top program is well underway and progressing well given the external environment we have decided to augment the program to protect returns as well as ensure that we can continue to make the important investments in our business to drive future performance we have increased our targeted benefit by million to million by accelerating some of our efforts to further rationalize our branch network and reduce procurement costs we have also begun planning for a top program looking for efficiency opportunities driven by further automation and use of ai to better serve our customers we are also looking at ways to simplify our organization and find even more savings in procurement continuous improvement is part of our dna and im very confident that well continue to deliver these benefits to the bank moving to slide ill walk through the outlook for the second quarter for citizens which excludes the impact of the private bank and i will also provide some comments for the full year the outlook takes into account another rate increase followed by fed on hold through the remainder of this year for the third quarter we expect nii to decrease about noninterest income to be up by approximately noninterest expense should be broadly stable net chargeoffs are expected to be broadly stable to up slightly our cet1 is expected to rise modestly from with additional share repurchases planned which will depend upon our ongoing assessment of the external environment relating to the full year our liquidity position is quite strong and given the bso actions i discussed earlier we will continue to build on this targeting an ldr of lowtomid by the end of the year positioning us well for anticipated regulatory changes worth noting we already are fully ldr compliant with category bank requirements based on the forward curve we are expecting a terminal interestbearing deposit beta of to our net interest margin should begin to stabilize in  as the fed is expected to reach the end of the rate hike cycle we are off to a great start in building out the private bank and we expect the eps impact of this to be in the third quarter and to in the fourth quarter so we really think of this as a capital investment to wrap up our results were solid for the quarter as we continued to navigate a turbulent external environment we are focused on positioning the company with a strong capital liquidity and funding position which will serve us well as we continue to navigate a challenging environment ahead our balance sheet strength also positions us very well to focus on our strategic priorities to continue to strengthen the franchise for the future and deliver attractive returns with that ill hand back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thanks john alan lets open it up for some qa citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 question and answer section operator and thank you thank you mr van saun we are now ready for the qa portion of the conference call operator instructions your first question will come from scott siefers with piper sandler go ahead scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everybody thank you for taking the question i guess first question is just on the sort of accretion to the margin from the balance sheet optimization do you have a sense for what sort of a steady state margin from citizens might look like after that is completed i guess doesnt necessarily have to be a specific number but just in your view how powerful is that accretion from these activities and i appreciate that sort of the backdrop of the yield versus the funding cost john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and start off scott thanks for the question i mean i think broadly were seeing the impact of the rate environment on our net interest margin were managing it quite well as the fed is continuing on its hiking cycle and as you get into the end of the year taking into consideration all of the balance sheet optimization activities we see nim flattening out and kind of holding in around or so as you get to the end of the year the tailwinds from balance sheet optimization are meaningful and will continue to build into and so those are the big drivers there i think that also contributing to that nim stability would be the fact that we think that balance sheet migration is starting to stabilize and also you cant ignore the fact that the private bank itself as you get out into will start to deliver accretive nim so were feeling good about the profile after we get through this last hike from the fed here in july watching that nim starts to stabilize as you get into the end of the year scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then is it possible to put sort of a finer point on the i guess to of cumulative expected eps drag from the private bank initiatives certainly appreciate sort of the loan and deposit and asset management or assets under management outlooks but maybe any broad sense for dollar value of expected revenues and expenses as we look into the second half john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and its a little bit frontend loaded as the expenses will come in and drive probably more in the neighborhood of of that to happening in the third quarter with the to really into the fourth quarter and its primarily expenses in the neighborhood of million or so as you get into the and but the loan book starts to build later this quarter and into so that gives you the yeah the indiscernible to into bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island the one thing i would say to that scott its bruce is this is a very sound approach to scaling up the wealth business weve been looking for acquisition ideas and its been very expensive with very long tangible book value earnbacks many times would be over five years which is beyond our appetite so to actually do this in a citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 kind of a de novo buildup basis you incur some capital expense in the short run but its almost the same as if you kind of equate it to an outlay that ultimately starts to generate revenues and the nice thing about this is that its accretive already in the second year and the kind of earnback on this thing is under two years so we look at it really less as a driver of how does it affect the nearterm eps but look theres a that capital outlay which we burned some expense dollars to get it off the ground and then all of a sudden its making us money and it really ramps very nicely and can achieve something like a accretion in which is kind of within two and a half years in the second year of doing a deal if you compare that to some of the other transactions that weve done including the bank acquisitions its pretty darn powerful so very excited about this opportunity scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you very much operator your next question will come from the line of erika najarian with ubs go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning john i was just wondering if you could help us with lots of the moving pieces thats sort of unfurling in front of us so just i guess the first question is you noted stability at the level does that mean that fourth quarter will be at about the third quarter level im just wondering sort of how those dynamics play out in terms of what you expect for the how the balance sheet trend for the rest of the year or sort of the runoff continue to pressure it at that level and what does that fourth quarter nii about look like from a range perspective john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think from a nim standpoint youre talking about just confirming erika thats indiscernible erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and building into john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah no i heard you reference but the answer is actually a little bit similar but what we do see is after the fed hikes here in july and that the impact of that get burns in in the third quarter that we do see nim flattening out there between and having a more flat profile as you get into the end of the year around so maybe a touch higher in net interest margin but seeing that profile begin to flatten out and i think that the key drivers of that and the pieces and parts as i mentioned were starting to see a deceleration in deposit migration a negative deposit migration so thats a good early green shoot thats consistent with the fact that our dda levels are basically where we were back to prepandemic and so that ends up being an expected landing zone as you get into the end of the year citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 so well see that flattening out youll see that the tailwinds from the runoff book start to kick in the reallocation of that capital and liquidity into relationship lending and the ability to pay down some highercost funding as you get into the end of the year and so that starts to bolster net interest margin which we do think carries into and we think that there are a number of positive developments in that would allow us to hold that nim out into even beyond the fourth quarter bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and i would comment erika that this was a really important quarter for us to kind of get the deposit level where we wanted to get the federal home loan bank borrowings lower and really take a big step in lowering the ldr and so we paid up a little bit to achieve that and the impact of that full quarter effect affects the third quarter guide but i think at this point we feel that we dont need to continue to really aggressively grow deposits we can have a more stable deposit profile which as john indicated less migration from noninterestbearing to interest bearing and so there wont be kind of a full quarter impact of an aggressive plan that affects  from  because well be kind of looking at a more stable profile in  erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and so thank you for that bruce so as i think about the fourth quarter is it fair then to say that your guidance implies nii of billion for the third quarter so do we assume that were at or around that range for the fourth quarter and as we think about the puts and takes of and john i have to bring this up because a few investors were noting i think now its slide where you have some swaps rolling off that have very heavy weighted average fixed rate that youre receiving so as i think about billion perhaps as a starting point plus or minus i assume that the your guide for down basis points nii for full year down is still valid if we assume rate cuts next year and includes the swap rolloff so thats sort of the first question and the second is how does balance sheet optimization impact that sensitivity so im assuming thats extraordinarily static and im assuming that from both sides are paying off more debt next year as you were waiting for these loans to come on and then your as you wait for these loans youre also putting it in higher yielding in cash so if you could just help us think through the moving pieces as it relates to that original disclosure because i think investors are thinking about the potential for rate cuts next year john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and maybe ill just start off in a couple of areas just when you think about nii some of the numbers that youre throwing out there are probably a little lighter than where we would see them come out i think our nii will be a little better than that and in the fourth quarter i think we have some opportunities too if interestearning assets are going to be stabilized as bruce indicated and net interest margin is stabilized so we think the nii is also stabilized at solid levels so that was i think the first question that you had i mean i think the bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island just to put a point on that too is that any swap impacts are in our forward guidance erika so weve already contemplated that so theres nothing and they didnt really move we didnt do any adjustments in the second quarter citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah theres very limited adjustments things do roll off and come on but broadly our asset sensitivity profile was pretty stable quarteroverquarter meaning we were still asset sensitive so a rate rise which were about to get from the fed does actually contribute to nii and net interest margin for us so from that perspective all of that has been built into the commentary that weve been giving you in terms of swap rolloff and our ongoing positive asset sensitivity again when you think about net interest margin over kind of the next several quarters we have a number of tailwinds youve got flattening out noninterestbearing migration so thats no longer expected to be a big headwind youve got the runoff book that we talked about and that runoff book is going to be rotated into relationship lending at higher yields so the runoff bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island paying off highcost debt john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and paying down highcost funding right so that we have a negative kind of spread situation there we already mentioned the fact that the private bank is going to start contributing to the balance sheet later this year and that the net interest margin on that is actually accretive to the overall legacy bank the other thing id throw out there is that just the front bookback book dynamics where you basically have originations in the front book just in the securities portfolio alone theres basis points plus positive front bookback book in terms of them were actually creating a bigger securities book but were doing it at the right time where securities yields are actually historically quite favorable and so were putting a lot away from that standpoint and were seeing back into the loan book spreads on our front book originations higher than they were and for example in ci spreads are up basis points over the last year yearoveryear so thats also a tailwind and all of those things are the things that are going to help us manage the fact that manage the rate environment and the other items that we have bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island so i think what john described erika is a number of tailwinds that should be positive so if the fed is cutting next year that potentially is a negative but wed have these positive things to offset that which gives us kind of that stable view on the nim into erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just to wrap it up just because i got a few emails to clarify and ill step aside it sounds like your sensitivity hasnt changed whatever that fourth quarter number is which is stable to third quarter the down on down basis points is still valid but then the balance sheet optimization will get you closer to stable despite fed cuts citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah agreed so balance sheet optimization plus the fact that when if the rates were rates begin to fall if they do we dont have that happening in the fourth quarter by the way we have that happening in bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island we have the fed on hold for the rest of the year and we have the fed just based on the forward curve right having the fed ending around in so its really until where you see those down rate scenarios and in the down rate scenario i mean thats where deposit betas start working for you rather than against you and so then you start getting some of that coming in as well as the fixed loan portfolio that creates a buffer when rates start to fall and so i would just add those two things to all the other tailwinds i already articulated as to why we feel like we can hold a stable nim bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah id just close and you got an extended period of time here erika and were very interested in nii and nim which im sure is on a lot of investors minds but kind of bigger picture as were kind of transitioning the loan book to things that are more strategic and offer better returns on capital and better opportunities for crosssell and deepening with customers and so were kind of working through a transition period this year and even into next year its a little hard to give you a full guidance at this point given a lot of uncertainty still in the market were giving you our best instincts at this point on that but i feel quite confident that as we kind of emerge through and then even look out to that kind of with the liftoff of this private bank effort and the kind of rundown of these less strategic portfolios that were going to get a lot of benefit from this and were really poised to do quite well i think looking out into kind of back half of into erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes bruce that private bank liftout is a boss move i think everybody just wanted to figure out what that runway look like and i think this conversation we just had clarified that runway so thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure operator your next question will come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank go ahead nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 hi good morning this is nate stein on behalf of matt oconnor just one question for me so the capital build was good this quarter with the cet1 rising to from and guidance calls for this to increase again in just wanted to ask how high are you willing to let the ratio get to bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island its bruce i think by the end of the year we could see it getting to which is a bit above our our stated range had been to i think given all the uncertainty thats out there in the economy plus direction of travel from regulators that managing it up like that is sensible having said that were still generating quite good returns which gives us the ability to kind of nudge that up from here in terms of the ratio but also repurchase our stock which we think is a great value at the current pricing so thats how were looking at it and then as we go through at this point our early thoughts would be kind of more of the same that we can at least hold that and maybe build on it based on what we see from regulators but we have the wherewithal to be in the market buying our stock on a consistent basis and holding or building that ratio further nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning bruce good morning john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc bruce and john can you guys share with us obviously vice chair barr has come out with a speech last week talking about rwa increases that will lead to higher capital levels for all banks over billion in assets have you guys given some thought on where you could be most impacted by the new basel iii endgame rules that maybe will come out next week and then second as part of this this week bloomberg reported that there may even be some rwa increases for residential mortgages which really hasnt been discussed and how are you guys approaching what could be coming possibly as soon as next week citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island let me start and ill quickly flip it to john but clearly i would say theres mixed views on whether thats a sound proposal at this point and i think the industry itself has acquitted itself very well through the pandemic through this period of turmoil in the first half of the year and i think many folks have commented that the industry has strong capital and so in response to three idiosyncratic bank failures is it appropriate that the thing that needs to be fixed is more capital in the banking system i dont know its a question whether thats appropriate and well see how it plays out i think therell be lots of dialogue around that i think from our standpoint by moving our capital position higher were anticipating any of what could come down the pike is something that we can absorb were in a very strong position relative to our scb which by the way were still have some questions about how this landed where it did but nonetheless were well above that and were well above if the aoci filter goes away we already have sufficient capital to meet our new proposed scb so were in a position of strength gerard i think we can still deliver the kind of returns we aspire to over time as we get through this transition period and hit our mediumterm financial targets but i would kind of at least comment that im not sure that thats the answer when we had a series of management supervisory failures and poor asset and liability management that really was the problem that caused this turmoil not a lack of capital in the banking system so ill get off my soapbox and ill pass it over to john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah agree with all of that and i think the issue is i think credit rwa versus operational risk rwa gerard so i think there was a view that there would be some puts and takes on the credit risk rwa and maybe it wouldnt be much of an increase expected at the regional bank level but we did see those reports on residential mortgages well see how it all plays out but on the operational risk side of things with a complex feebased sort of businesses where a lot of that is directed and its not just we dont have as much of exposure to that as maybe some other banks in the industry do so broadly we felt like that we would be impacted possibly a little less than most and were sitting with capital a little more than most and so from that perspective we feel pretty well positioned for the uncertainty of the regulatory rule making process and as you heard from bruce were growing capital into the end of the year and i think something in the neighborhood of cet1 is a pretty strong mitigant to anything that might come down the road from the fed gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you guys operator your next question will come from the line of ken usdin with jefferies go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 hey thanks good morning i just wanted to follow up on the strategic remixing and wondering can you give us some color on the types of loans and deposits that you think will come over as part of those new hires in the private bank i mean obviously the first republic mix had been kind of lowrate mortgages and highrate cds i would expect thats not the type of nim youre looking to be adding so just wondering just what those producers youre expecting to bring over and also kind of we could see it in your aum expectation but it looks like itd be more nii delivering as opposed to fees bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island turn that over to brendan brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so yeah we are really excited obviously about this initiative and its a very strategic acceleration of our wealth management business but to your point it does come with scaling up the bank as well while we are aiming to recreate a lot of the customer experience magic that existed in these private banking models where we are going to make some structural changes to make sure that the profile of the business that we get is accretive at the top of the house so what you can expect from us is disciplined credit pricing that while well be competitive were not going to kind of lead with undercutting the market in pricing to make sure we have the right margin we will have incredibly disciplined credit appetite we dont expect to take a step forward or step in the wrong direction in terms of credit risk profile in fact we think this will enhance the credit risk profile with very low risk loan generation we are going to ensure that were driving lendable deposits on the balance sheet that we put out relative to the private bank that were getting core operating deposits whether thats from individuals or from businesses its really important that we maintain a sound liquidity position in this growth and lastly from a compensation perspective were going to so rationalize the compensation model best we can within the confines of a private bank to ensure that both the combination of those factors give us a return profile that can be accretive at the top of the house on overall roe but also on things like nim so the balance sheet on the deposit side certainly will have a mix of cash management operating deposits as well as interestbearing but we are going to tether all relationships to being primary banking whether its corporate or whether its personal so you can expect lowcost dda to be mixed in with interestbearing for a healthy profile primary banking relationships on the asset side id say were expecting about a mix of what i would call sort of consumer personal retail lending and small business and corporate lending and on the personal lending side really the large asset classes are going to be mortgage home equity and eventually partner loan program where were putting capital out to individuals to engage as a partner in a higherend consulting firm or private equity firm very traditional lowrisk assets that dislodge the operating deposits and ultimately lead you to aum and on the business side as was mentioned earlier the profile of the team we got over does have a bent towards the innovation economy so were expecting capital call line lending to dislodge operating deposit relationships with private equity and venture and a small segment where its appropriate relationshipwise on a potentially multifamily in a very high credit environment where we can also secure the personal wealth relationship all of our balance sheet usage will be oriented around full endtoend customer relationships that include deposits and ultimately aum growth so its a very integrated endtoend business model and we feel like weve got the citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 right recreation of the service strategy married with the right corrections to the business model to ensure we get better profitability and also a stable business model that can withstand the test of the time and we think we can get really good growth around this but we will control the growth with a guardrail of adequate profile of the business that will be healthy and profitable over the long haul ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great color thank you brendan and just one more question on the other side of the bso john obviously talking a lot about the consumer side of the noncore portfolio here can you just dig in and just let us know you previously had done a lot on the commercial portfolio and im just wondering have you done and you currently deep diving into the cre book as youve talked about on the credit side what might there still be to do on the commercial side of the portfolio in terms of bso from that perspective thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think and as you know in this portfolio that weve set up its entirely a retail portfolio in terms of that billion but there are nevertheless in parallel bso activities continuing in the commercial side and let don talk about that donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so weve been at this for probably three or four years now as weve just thrown out relationships where we havent been able to achieve the crosssell that we thought we were going to achieve when we were going into the credit several years ago so its really an ongoing effort its been running about billion a year and we probably will be running about that same pace the good news is weve been able to replace some of that with growth in places like new york metro where we see a good amount of opportunity on a full wallet basis particularly in the middle market as we bring on these new hires on the cre side as everybody knows theres not a lot of liquidity but there is some liquidity and were actually moving some of our exposures out through the agencies and through some private capital also so well try to liquefy particularly multifamily over the next couple of quarters couple of years to the best we can and bring those overall exposures down even though theyre performing pretty well ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc good okay thank you very much operator your next question will come from the line of john pancari with evercore go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning just on the capital side i heard you in terms of the cet1 trajectory from here and that it does still allow for some repurchases i mean could you help us frame out whats the reasonable pace of buybacks which assumes that similar to the million that you did this quarter citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would say that is something we felt comfortable with in  we were going through the or  we were going through the ccar process at the time but we saw the opportunity to build kind of have our cake and eat it too build the ratio while also repurchasing shares and i think well still be in that position so we still have non core kind of rundown working for us which is releasing rwas so you should again have a chance to somewhat have your cake and eat it too both in  and  john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you bruce and then on the noninterestbearing mix stabilizing at the near the level now what gives you confidence in the stabilization i know you mentioned youre not pushing as aggressively you dont see the need to now on competition on pricing is there anything though beyond that in terms of depositor behavior that youre beginning to see that gives you that confidence that this is where its bottoming john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think theres two items that we look at one is just the as we are getting back to the historical place that the platform generated noninterestbearing prepandemic and so thats been sort of a foundational spot that we think creates some solidification of the operating accounts in both retail and consumer so thats one really important spot so around that level is about how we see it and then the second item is that in the second quarter we started to see some deceleration for the first time in several quarters we started to see the turn and deposits kind of migration decelerating and then we have a number of i would say activities on the product and lowcost strategy front that were seeing some really positive uptick on in retail in particular and so bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island why dont you ask brendan john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island so to pick up and add some color brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah couple of quick points just a quick recall as weve talked over the last bunch of quarters the consumer portfolio has been under a five to sixyear transformation for quite some time and is in a very very different starting point to the beginning of the cycle than ever before for this franchise with significant improvements in things like customer primacy growth in households our mass affluent mix has improved and lowcost deposit profile has moved up so coming into the cycle we were very confident that wed be more peer like or maybe citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 outperform and data that were seeing with benchmarking suggests and in the consumer bank we are indeed better than average versus peers right now on all dimensions interestbearing cost beta as well as lowcost control so we feel pretty good how were performing against the peers it is starting to stabilize so the excess surge deposits have burned down maybe by about so theres still a little bit out there but a lot of those are starting to be sticky and turn into wealth creation if you dissect the various different segments the wealthier segment is still having some modest outflows and rotation into interestbearing as well as rotation outside of the banking industry so yearoveryear the wealthier segment is down about were seeing the mass affluent segment in deposits on a per customer basis about flat and the mass market portfolio has actually increased in net deposits and thats a function of a lot of our strategies that weve put in place to really drive primacy and activity and engagement and so weve seen a bit of a bottoming at the lower end in terms of dda balances what we had done to drive that is a lot of product innovation so we did things like get your paycheck two days early it doesnt seem like a big deal its actually an incredibly big deal and its driving a lot of primary banking behavior weve got technology we put in place that when you open a new dda youre automatically porting over your direct deposit it seems very operationally oriented but it actually is a dramatic improvement that things like primary banking behavior which drives lowcost deposits weve made overdraft reform through our peace of mind 24hour grace program and a variety of other things which has also driven a lot of primacy and were starting to really rev up the engines on household growth overall all of those things contribute to some controllables so i think were outperforming peers on the market given our starting point in the cycle and were continuing to invest to try to further outperform through all of these different initiatives and strategies it is the long game these are driving primacy and lowcost deposits takes a while to build up scale but i feel like weve got a lot of the right things in place in addition to outperforming on our back book to win the game on controllables where were at right now john pancari q analyst evercore isi so while youre twothirds of the deposit base and have all these great strategies youve done youve also been investing in payments capabilities and some new products like sustainable deposits maybe you could just offer donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thats right i mean weve been broadening out our deposit base quite nicely and as bruce said its a combination of just the growth in the cash management business overall and bringing on more clients on the cash management side as i said in new york metro the things that were adding are really full wallet full cash management relationships those bring really nice deposits and then on the product side weve done a lot around green deposits and carbon offset deposits in our esg strategy those have proved to be quite profitable weve built out escrow products and bankruptcy products so theres a variety of product development things which are attracting nice operating deposits with some indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks thank you citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks operator your next question will come from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i appreciate all the detail on the office book it looks like you have a pretty conservative assumption baked into your cre office reserve levels of i guess the question is what would you need to see to take that up even more or over the next few quarters as some of your office portfolio comes up for renewal should we expect the reserve levels go down as you have more normalized ncos in that portfolio bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island let me start and john or don can add but we feel quite good about a the overall nature of what we have and b then so theres good diversification good quality characteristics we have some really good people that are really focused hard on this and theyre monitoring this loan by loan they see the upcoming maturities they get way in front of those so were having good dialog with borrowers and id say we did a good job relatively good job in the first half of absorbing some of the maturities and probably about loans i think came up for maturity which is about the number that were going to have in the second half and its about the number that were going to have in the first half of next year its about the number that were going to have in the fourth quarter next year and if you look at the net result of that while we have an increase in criticized we have an increase this quarter was a little lumpy in npas in the sector and that probably levels off id say we were able to build our reserve and absorb chargeoffs so we took million in chargeoffs so thats another and a loss content if you look at the its effectively higher by what we just absorbed and so could we go for another few quarters with absorbing chargeoffs kind of on a payasyougo basis with what were providing and hold the reserve flat yeah possibly that could happen and then at some point does that tip over and then you dont need as much reserve because youve burned some of those losses through your chargeoff line so anyway thats just a little color about how we think about it john i dont know if you want to add anything or go direct to don john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill just reiterate the fact that as you mentioned we took million thats so that weve got weve got set aside so that implies a coverage for the losses through the cycle and we think thats pretty darn adequate as a matter of fact very strong and so i think that you also mentioned npls flattening out and chargeoffs kind of getting into run rate rather than step change from here which i think is important to reemphasize and maybe just turn it over to don donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island no i think you guys have said it was loans so youre pretty close to thats pretty good you know that but i think the thing id emphasize is weve literally gone through every single loan one by one and everyone is citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 different its property specific its msa specific its rent roll specific its sponsor specific and were starting to see outcomes and outcomes are a property gets extended and renegotiated with the sponsor you might have a little bit of equity injected to improve interest carry and you might charge it off so and i think that we have a pretty good eye to the path of the book as we look forward and things could always change but i think we feel pretty comfortable that weve been very conservative based on what we see and i will emphasize i mean were not originating anything really of any scale in origination so our whole origination team in addition to our credit team in addition to our indiscernible team is focused on working with our sponsors to basically indiscernible donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island and by the way the rest of the real estate both multifamily industrial datacenters i think looks like its holding up extremely well were really not seeing any weakness that concerns us at all in the rest of the real estate book manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc thats very helpful thanks for the fulsome answer just to move on to capital is there any color you can share on what drove the increase in the stress capital buffer this year i know the mortgage was something that was a little bit of a headwind for the whole group but any other information youve gleaned from your conversations with the fed and then maybe what you need to do to bring that down in future years bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah we havent really had the full debrief so were getting that set up so we can go through and kind of understand their models better i think thats been one of the concerns of the industry that its not that transparent to us but kind of when we look at the results theres a couple of things that could have been a factor so one is the build of the allowance when we took relatively high chargeoffs we had a significant build was built into their models which we didnt have in our models and that alone probably cost us basis points of the basis points increase or something like that so thats one thing that well want to talk about and understand better and then questions about we did a deal and did the onetime expenses get incorporated or weve done a lot of hedging in the falling rate scenario are our hedges getting full benefit so we just have some questions we want to poke at but in any case i think the bigger point here is that we can roll with this the and we have plenty of capital and we have a appreciable buffer versus that capital so it really doesnt affect kind of our capital management strategies but we would like to see it get kind of back into line we think its a bit elevated relative to where it should be and well be having those conversations with the fed in the coming weeks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think that as you get past this year where we had those integration expenses and theres a hypothesis that that will roll off as you get into next year well have another bite at the apple next year given the fact that were going to be doing this again and in the end the scb is not our constraint our constraint is our own view of what capital we need to be prudent to support our business and frankly where the fed and regulators are headed with citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 required kind of levels outside of the scb is going to be our constraint so were going to be as bruce mentioned earlier about basis points over the scb by the end of the year and probably heading towards earlier compliance with whatever the fed comes out with at most so were feeling pretty darn good about the capital position notwithstanding the scb manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and the bso should have a positive impact on your riskweighted assets should that also have a positive impact on the scb john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well it might i mean i think more importantly it gives us the flexibility to rotate rwa capital into relationship lending and return that capital to the extent that there was front book opportunities are not there we probably have the opportunity to do both where we rotate that capital into relationship lending and provide an ability to buy back doesnt have a direct impact on the scb manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator and your next question one moment please your next question will come from the line of vivek juneja go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thank you just a followup on the first republic banker question bruce brendan what requirements do you what are your pricing assumptions you said youre planning to bring the pricing to yours but then what are the assumptions for what the bankers need to deliver to be able to recoup their or earn their guarantees and secondly given that this was a whiteglove service which is obviously very expensive what changes are you planning to make to that to be able to get to your hurdle profitability targets brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah yeah thanks for the question we already prior to the liftout of the private bankers had a relationship based pricing in play in all of our asset classes including mortgage so when you bring heavy levels of deposits and aum we price down modestly for that so we dont have any intention of changing what we already do and so our new private bankers will have access to the same relationship pricing grids that weve had in place for a while so as you think of our pricing and yields of things like mortgages or even some of the small business commercial lending were not expecting a dramatic different profile in terms of profitability or yields from legacy citizens and how we operate the business to make sure that were considering the full relationship and that were really competitive in pricing but were not undercutting the market by a material amount that will deteriorate either lending return bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 and i think the corollary to that is that the teams that came over understand that brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island they do bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and so id say the one thing that they wont have in their arsenal is deeply discounted mortgages but i think they come in with their eyes wide open on that and quite honestly the deeply discounted mortgages are probably now back on your balance sheet because people arent refinancing those at a good clip so theyll probably sit there for a long time but anyway we will kind of do business in a commercial way and again the bigger the relationship the better the pricing generally and so i think the team coming over is very comfortable with that brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island and then a question around expenses implied in the comments that john and bruce both made around breakeven inside of is the teams production covering kind of indiscernible to come over so weve been really thoughtful about how we do that but obviously weve got the way these folks get paid its on a book of business model and theyre going to go out and develop a lot of business and were going to give them the runway to do that we had a lot of debate with them on the appropriate timing to make that happen and make sure the operations excellence is available here at citizens with that the cost of that is considered in all of our guidance and commentary we made about the profitability of the business and were already well underway on tinkering with the way the bank works to make sure were creating the conditions for them bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and id say there wed probably have the brakes on a little bit to make sure that we get it to the level because you kind of get one shot with some of these customers brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and so weve got a full effort on making sure that we get to the standards that we need i would say one other silver lining from that also is that thatll help us up our game in customer experience more broadly the kind of initiatives that were taking to make sure that we make this a great experience therell be some things that spin off from that that we can move to other parts of the bank without a question vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you and a followup for just don don what are you seeing on the whole sponsor side given with high rates in the market what level do you expect it to come back to even in say just given if rates stay citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 high yes some cuts but i dont think anybody is expecting it to go back to where we were a year and a half ago so any thoughts on what level of activity do you think we get back donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah well see high level our pipelines are about higher than they were at this time last quarter so were seeing the pipelines build the sponsors are certainly engaging in conversations whether they can get to actual transactions or not although there have been some there was a ph worldpay transaction that was announced a few weeks ago so were beginning to see some transactions remember one of the things that we benefit from and ive said this a couple of quarters is we tend to play in smaller deals right so were million to million to billion in terms of deal size whether it be advisory or financing we were number one in the middle market leverage finance league tables in the last quarter volumes were down but we were the number one institution playing so were gaining share for whats available so do i think were going to be back to levels no but i think if you get stability in rates its the beginning of deal formation will happen and itll just depend on valuation dynamics between sponsors and sellers and theres just a lot of companies in our portfolio that just need to sell they want to sell for generational reasons so there are things that are available deals may get overequitized just to keep the interest burden down value doesnt come down but were starting to see a lot of conversations going so i dont think were going to be off to the races but i think its going to continually build and i think could be a pretty good year vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator there are no further questions in queue and with that ill turn it back over to mr van saun for closing remarks bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island all right thanks alan and thanks again everyone for dialing in today we certainly appreciate your interest and support have a great day operator
