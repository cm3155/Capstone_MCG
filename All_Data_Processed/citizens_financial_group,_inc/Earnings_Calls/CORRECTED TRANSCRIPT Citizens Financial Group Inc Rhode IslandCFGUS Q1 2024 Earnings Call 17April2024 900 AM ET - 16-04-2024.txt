the commercial bank of serving the middlemarket private capital and key growth verticals has put us in great position to benefit from a pickup in deal activity which we expect to build further over the course of the citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 year and our top program is being executed well allowing us to selffund our growth investments while keeping overall expense growth rate muted while there are still many uncertainties in the external environment we feel we are in good position to navigate the challenges that may

commercial banking segments are positioned for success and we are now looking to build the premier bank on private bank and wealth franchise our balance sheet has been repositioned with an exceptionally strong capital liquidity and funding profile and we are deploying our loan capital more selectively to achieve better riskadjusted returns our expense base has been tightly managed with ai offering the potential for further breakthroughs lots accomplished with more to do clearly exciting times for citizens with that let me turn it over to john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone as bruce mentioned the year is off to a good start first quarter results were solid against the backdrop of a more constructive macro environment which supported an improvement in capital markets stability in our margin and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with capital levels near the top of our peer group excellent liquidity and a healthy credit reserve position importantly this positions us to execute well against our multiyear strategic initiatives including the buildout of our private bank let me start with some highlights of our first quarter financial results referencing slides to before i discuss the details we generated underlying net income of million for the first quarter and eps of this includes a negative impact from the private bank which is a significant improvement from the impact last quarter as we start to see revenues pick up and we progress to our expected breakeven in it also includes the impact of the noncore portfolio which contributed a negative impact while our non core portfolio is currently a sizable drag to results it is steadily running off creating a tailwind for performance going forward our notable items this quarter were which primarily consists of an adjustment to the fdic special assessment and top and other efficiencyrelated expenses excluding these notable items our underlying rotce for the quarter was playing prudent defense remains at the top of our priority list and we ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet position with cet1 at or adjusted for the aoci optout removal we also continued to make meaningful improvements to our funding and liquidity profile in the first quarter our pro forma lcr strengthened to which is well in excess of the large bank category requirement of and our periodend ldr improved to from in the prior quarter on the funding front we reduced our periodend fhlb borrowings by about billion linked quarter to a modest billion we also increased our structural funding base with a very successful billion senior issuance and another billion auto collateralized issuance during the quarter and we have another billion of autobacked issuance expected to settle this week this is our fourth issuance and it was executed at our tightest credit spreads todate in addition we expect to be a more programmatic issuer of senior unsecured debt going forward credit trends have been performing inline with our expectations with ncos coming in at basis points for the first quarter our acl coverage ratio of is up basis points from yearend this includes the citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 coverage for general office up slightly from in the prior quarter we are wellpositioned for the medium term with expected tailwinds to nim that support a range of to regarding strategic initiatives the private bank is doing very well we continue to make inroads in the new york metro and our latest top program is progressing nicely in addition we are poised to benefit from an improving capital markets environment with our investments in the business and synergies from our acquisitions positioning us to capitalize as activity levels continue to pick up next ill talk to the first quarter results in more detail starting with net interest income on slide as expected nii is down linked quarter reflecting a stable margin and a decrease in average interestearning assets given lower loan balances and day count as you can see from the nim walk at the bottom of the slide our margin was flat at as the combined benefit of higher asset yields and noncore runoff and day count were offset by higher funding costs and the impact of swaps as expected our cumulative interestbearing deposit beta remains in the low at and although we continue to see deposit migration the rate of migration is slowing overall our deposit franchise has performed well with our beta generally intact with peers moving to slide our fees were up linked quarter given a notable improvement in capital markets and good card results the improvement in capital markets reflects a nice pickup in ma activity and strong bond underwriting results our capital markets business consistently holds the top middlemarket sponsor book runner position and this quarter we achieved the number one spot our deal pipeline remains strong and we continue to see positive early momentum in capital markets this quarter with strong refinancing activity continuing in the bond market in card we had a nice increase primarily driven by the benefit of a strategic conversion of our debit and credit cards to mastercard our client hedging business was down a bit this quarter with lower activity in commodities and fx the decline in mortgage banking fees was driven by a lower benefit from the msr valuation net of hedging and a modest decline in servicing pl partially offset by higher production fees as margin improved while lock volumes were stable on slide we did a nice job managing our underlying expenses which were stable we will continue to execute on our top program which gives us the capacity to selffund our growth initiatives on slide periodend and average loans are down linked quarter this was driven by noncore portfolio runoff and a decline in commercial loans given paydowns and generally lower client loan demand our highly selective approach to lending in this environment along with exits of lower returning creditonly relationships commercial line utilization continued to decline this quarter as clients remain cautious and ma activity was limited in the face of an uncertain market environment next on slides and we continue to do well in deposits yearonyear periodend deposits were up billion driven by growth in retail and the private bank periodend deposits were down slightly linked quarter given expected seasonal impacts in commercial largely offset by growth in the private bank and retail branch deposits our interestbearing deposit costs were wellcontrolled up basis points which translates to a cumulative beta our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels about of our deposits are granular stable consumer deposits and approximately of our overall deposits are insured or secured this attractive deposit base has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in the higher rate environment with the fed holding steady we saw the migration of deposits to higher cost categories citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 continue to moderate and with the contribution of attractive deposits from the private bank noninterestbearing deposits are holding steady at about of total deposits moving on to credit on slide net chargeoffs were basis points up basis points linked quarter this includes increased commercial chargeoffs related to cre general office which were inline with our expectations in retail we saw a modest seasonal improvement nonaccrual loans increased linked quarter driven by cre general office the continued runoff of the auto portfolio drove a modest decline in retail while other retail categories were stable turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide our overall coverage ratio stands at which is a basis point increase from the fourth quarter reflecting broadly stable reserves with lower loan balances given noncore runoff and commercial balance sheet optimization the reserve for the billion general office portfolio represents coverage up slightly from in the fourth quarter on the bottom leftside of the page you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level we feel these assumptions represent a severe scenario that is much worse than weve seen in historical downturns so we feel the current coverage is very strong moving to slide we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength our cet1 ratio is a strong and if you were to adjust for the aoci optout removal under the current regulatory proposal our cet1 ratio would be both our cet1 and tce ratios have consistently been among the top of our peers and you can see on slide where we stand currently relative to peers in the fourth quarter given our strong capital position we resumed common share repurchases and including dividends we returned a total of million to shareholders in the first quarter on the next few pages ill update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank including our private bank first on slide we have a strong transformed consumer bank with a robust and capable deposit franchise a diverse lending business where we are prioritizing relationshipbased lending and a meaningful revenue opportunity as we scale our wealth business importantly we continue to make great progress taking deposit share with retail deposits up yearonyear as we continue building our customer base in new york metro on slide let me update you on our progress in building a premier private bank taking the opportunity to fill the void left in the wake of the bank failures last year our buildout is going very well and gaining momentum we are growing our client base and now have about billion of attractive deposits with roughly noninterest bearing also we are now at just over billion of loans and billion dollars of investments and continuing to grow we just opened our newest private banking office in palm beach florida and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities with our clarfeld wealth management business as the centerpiece of that effort next on slide we have built a formidable fullservice commercial bank which consistently punches above its weight our multiyear investments in talent capabilities and industry expertise put us in an enviable position to provide life cycle services to middlemarket midcorporate and sponsor clients in highgrowth sectors of the us economy in particular we are uniquely positioned to serve the private capital ecosystem as evidenced by our consistent standing at the top of the sponsor league tables we are wellpositioned to take advantage of a more citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 constructive capital markets environment and we are excited to start seeing the synergies from our acquisitions coming through in our results this quarter moving to slide we provide the guide for the second quarter we expect nii to decrease about noninterest income should be up approximately to we expect noninterest expense to be stable to down slightly net chargeoffs are expected to be about basis points and the acl should continue to benefit from the noncore runoff our cet1 is expected to come in at about with approximately million of share repurchases currently planned we are broadly reaffirming our fullyear guide we expect nii to land within the range of down to consistent with our january guidance with margin coming in a little better than expected offsetting the impact of lower loan demand the other components of ppnr are also tracking to our january guidance in addition ncos are trending inline with our expectations of approximately basis points for the year our target cet1 ratio for is approximately and the level of share repurchases will be dependent on our view of the external environment and loan growth given the change in rate outlook i wanted to update you on how the swaps and our noncore portfolio are expected to impact nii and nim as we look out further in and beyond weve included slide in the appendix which shows the expected swaps and noncore impact through by we expect higher swap expense to be partly offset by the nii benefit from the noncore rundown looking out further we expect a significant nii tailwind and nim benefit from the impact of noncore and swaps over the mediumterm given runoff and lower rates this will be partially offset by the impact of the assetsensitive core balance sheet resulting in a mediumterm nim range of to to wrap up we delivered a solid quarter featuring stable nim strong fee performance led by capital markets and cards tight expense management and inline credit performance we have a series of unique initiatives that are progressing well our consumer bank has been transformed our commercial bank is exceptionally well positioned and we aim to build the premier bankowned private bank and wealth franchise we enjoy a strong capital liquidity and funding profile that allows us to support our customers while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives given several tailwinds combining with continued strong execution we are confident in our ability to hit our mediumterm of to return target with that i will hand it back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you john and alan lets open it up for qa citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 question and answer section operator thank you mr van saun we are now ready for the qa portion of the call operator instructions our first question will come from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs your line is open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning bruce good morning john bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc maybe to start off with some of the guidance you broadly reiterated can you maybe just flesh out how some of the expectations have changed particularly around nii john i think you noted you still expect to be in the range but what are the main drivers to get you there and what would it take to be better than the lowend and just as a followup on the margin you held it flat and it sounds like it could be a little bit better how will the expectations change relative to the to and the you were expecting at the end of the year thank you john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure ill go ahead and talk through that i would say as you may have heard in some of the opening remarks we do expect that net interest margin trends have been quite good and so we do expect net interest margin to come in a little better maybe at the highend of that range rather than where we were at the beginning of the year and a lot of the drivers of that net interest margin can depend on the investments we made in the deposit franchise over the years that are really starting to come to fruition and when you look at it deposit levels were better in the first quarter than we expected and interestbearing deposit costs are a little bit better so just and funding overall when you look at our borrowing mix has improved significantly so thats underpinning a lot of the net interest margin and when you combine that with the other side of the balance sheet where you see the front book back book dynamic playing out its very powerful and so were feeling better about nim trajectory and i think thats what youre seeing with respect to our confidence in hitting that net interest income range given the confidence around net interest margin as you get towards the end of the year as i mentioned i think previously we said our guide would be around to in that range id say were probably going to come in at the upperend of that range now when we look out and maybe a tad above well see as it plays out and then well see the loan just given where loan demand has started off the year maybe average loans maybe towards the lower end of that original range but those offset a couple of basis points of nim equals about percentage point on loans so that math just works out to be right down the middle of the fairway in terms of our guide citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 what could cause it to come in a little better continued execution of our strategic initiatives if we see our execution kind of accelerating across the private bank and our other key initiatives on the deposit side and lets see how the secondhalf commercial rebound plays out we are expecting working capital starting to pick up in the secondhalf were expecting utilization levels to pick up were expecting activity in general even in the ma front and ma finance to be part of the story in the secondhalf and so if that starts a little earlier or comes in a little stronger you could see us coming in maybe towards the lower end of that original nii guide bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah which is to add one thing ryan its bruce that the fact that the loan demand is a little light is i think okay given theres a kind of loop to what were doing on the deposit side so were not going to chase loan growth if therefore theres a little shrinkage in the balance sheet we can run off our higher cost source of either fhlb funding or our brokered deposit funding so were taking full advantage of that which is helping bolster the nim the other thing is with less loan growth you end up freeing more capital and so that gives us the wherewithal to step up and continue to repurchase stock and i think our stock has great value here so were allin on that ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and thanks for all the color and just maybe as a followup just any color in terms of what youre seeing on the credit side which seems to be tracking inline with your expectations and maybe specific to office where we saw a jump in the losses this quarter relative to the past few maybe just some color on whats driving that was that increased severity are you frontloading some losses and when inevitably do you think we could see the allowance in that portfolio peak thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island let me start and then flip to don but i would say theres no real surprises here ryan so we can basically see all the office maturities weve got kind of bespoke careful handling on all of the significant exposures that we have and weve been working with the borrowers just to make sure that we can have a winwin situation so we can come through getting the best return on our loans and the borrowers can stay with their properties through a tough environment and i think thats all going well so if you have one quarter where the chargeoffs tick up million or the next quarter they go down million youre going to kind of see some modest variation around that line but basically to use a colloquialism the pig is going through the python and its going to take a few more quarters for that to fully work its way through but were not seeing any surprises which is the good thing about this and so don with that maybe you could pick up donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island no i think thats exactly right weve taken our general office from about billion to billion so its actually coming down nicely and the chargeoffs have actually been modest most of the chargeoffs are what were selling out of properties and doing a deal on structures and basically deciding to move on citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 weve had a quite a few paydowns also so its not all doom and gloom but i go back to what bruce said its namebyname propertybyproperty weve got our workout teams fully involved its kind of playing out exactly as we expected it to be if i took myself back a yearandahalf ago and looked at the office portfolio there was a lot of uncertainty i think theres a lot more uncertainty now so remember ive got a huge amount of absorption capacity ph adjusted amount of pl for any losses that are materializing and our reserve levels for the portfolio are wellabove where the severity of losses today have been so we feel like were going to work through this as bruce said over the next few quarters and begin to pick out the loss levels bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and just maybe john you can add to this but in terms of where do we go from here you can see that the coverage ratio on office remains high and its gone from reserves to but that rate of increase is slowing and so weve been taking the full chargeoff through the pl and holding that reserve in high levels at some point well be able to start drawing down on that reserve so i dont want to make the call on that but just take note that that build is starting to slow and so i dont know if its maybe later this year or beginning of next year but we will eventually get to a point where we can start drawing down on those reserves which will be good for pl john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah agree with all that i just add a point or two so weve built into the and youll see it in some of our slide materials is an expectation of a decline in property values and thats what drives this of reserve for remaining losses bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island which is more severe than anything weve seen historically john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island including the great financial recession by a wide margin john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island exactly and i think we should also mention that just given what we put behind us implies another of losses that we put behind us so weve got in the reserve weve charged off about so youre up over in terms of coverage we feel pretty good about it and thats where we think the losses are going to play out and as bruce mentioned well the chargeoffs themselves maybe they peak later this year or early next but we think weve got the reserves covered bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 yeah ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks so much guys bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island indiscernible theyre very good john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay next question operator your next question will come from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the question bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co john maybe just a thought on how much longer negative deposit migration continues and i think the prevailing wisdom is that its slowing but just curious to hear your updated thoughts on kind of when and why we might trough john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean weve been saying for a while that things have been decelerating and i would say our deposit performance this quarter has been excellent in terms of versus what we were expecting coming into the year so again deposit levels overall look good dda flows and lowcost to highcost migration overall continuing to decelerate and i think we can point to if you look at where we are we were at around of dda at the end of last year at december and that flattened out we were at at march so dda for us is stabilizing and the however the lowcost to highcost again decelerating and as you and it will continue to decelerate and what weve been indicating is that thats going to continue until you see the first cut out of the fed which is historically what we would expect but its getting to the point where its having a citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 diminishing impact on net interest margin and so when you elevate overall the contribution that our deposit franchise is delivering for net interest margin trends is excellent and were feeling very good about the trajectory of dda stability throughout the rest of and getting back to growth because when you think about whats idiosyncratic to us and the strategic initiatives that were launching the private bank noninterestbearing is accretive to the overall company were at maybe around or more and so thats dragging that number up so i think we some exits bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island indiscernible new york metro offers another opportunity john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and new york metro as well is really a good point so the combination of those strategic initiatives we have some expectation of dda flattening out and growing as you get into the latter part of the year and that underpins the net interest margin quite nicely bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah maybe brendan you can add some color brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure weve been talking for a couple of years now around how so much of our deposit book comes through consumer that we believe that weve transformed the book to be purelike or better and i would just reiterate that thats what were seeing we were up modestly linked quarter on overall deposits in the consumer book with some benchmarking that we get from a variety of sources we believe we were number one in our peer set linked quarter on dda so on a relative basis we still have a lot of confidence that were outperforming peers and its demonstrating the franchise quality that weve built when you look at the customer level customer deposits have actually been quite stable around per customer and the remixing of as john pointed out is pretty dramatically falling and i think thats kind of indicating that the covid burndown is beginning to really run its course so there may be a little bit more but we feel pretty good that were getting kind of the end of that behavioral cycle when you look at overall deposits on an inflationadjusted basis theyre back to basically precovid so i think were kind of nearing the operating floors here for consumer given the strength of lowcost deposits that we have had relative to peers the other implication is how were managing interestbearing deposits i do believe that weve peaked in the consumer segment in  in our cost of funds and why do i believe that we had billion in cd rollover in march alone that were priced around weve retained of those as they flipped over at materially lower prices between and so you start to see the tailwinds building in that you can imagine the cost of funds in the consumer segment potentially beginning to reduce well see how it plays out where rates are at but i do believe weve sort of peaked here in  and its really driven by the strength of our lowcost performance so we dont need to chase high interestbearing cost as a result of that so i feel really good about where were at citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right good thank you very much for the color bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay operator your next question will come from the line of john pancari with evercore your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi john pancari q analyst evercore isi i wanted to like get some additional color on the loan growth commentary i know you said it could come in at the lowend of your initial expectation for the year and you cited weaker line utilization at this point if you could maybe elaborate a little bit where you see some weakness and what pockets and where do you see some ultimate strengthening there in terms of timing and then separately a similar question around your deposit growth expectation i think for the fullyear you had put it out at around up to any additional color you can provide or how youre feeling around that guidance at this point john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island maybe ill just start off on loans and others can add but i mean what were seeing is that utilization coming in a little lower in the first quarter and ph that beta than was originally expected but nevertheless we still see in the secondhalf the interest around putting some working capital to work and commercial activity starting to pick up is really going to drive that reversal of that utilization trend as you get into the secondhalf on the retail side of things were still seeing good opportunities in relationship mortgage and heloc and in the private bank where weve gotten a nice start in terms of which is mostly a commercial lendingdriven amount of activity in the subscription line space and we see that picking up so allin playing out about as expected meaning we may be just a little bit lighter on loans but we had expected that would be the case and then the pickup in the secondhalf will be coming out of the commercial business and private bank maybe any other color bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 that was wellsaid don any color donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah no i think its across the board on the commercial side and part of it is due to the booming bond markets were seeing a lot of customers access the bond markets as opposed to draw down existing lines and then i think theres a positive to it also not for a loan levels but customers are running with lower leverage levels because theyve been concerned about the economy were seeing a broad more positive view of the overall economy across really wide swaths of our client base so that would indicate that theyre going to get more active in things like plant construction working capital growth ma and so that should drive some bounce back in the backhalf of the year bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah anything from you brendan brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah the only thing i would add is maybe just strategically that theres a lot of insandouts under the covers so as we run down auto by essentially billion a quarter and other noncore its getting replaced with high relationship higher returning asset growth whether its on heloc side or the private bank so the headline numbers that you see around our loan growth what you have to dig into is the transformative use of capital that were doing around a handful of areas to have more durable sticky revenue sources that are going to create more crosssell around fees and other things over time so were pleased with how thats going bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island now you had a question about deposits on the deposit side of things in the first quarter as i mentioned before we saw dda flatten out for the first time in many quarters so that is really good to see we also saw low cost flatten out so overall we were at last quarter in lowcost were at this quarter in lowcost plus dda so the deposit trends from a mix perspective have been favorable and from a quantity level of deposits at the end of the quarter came in higher than expected thats driven by just strong execution and our strategic initiatives contributing as we mentioned earlier new york metro and private bank along with the blockingandtackling that brendan and don have been at for a number of years to invest in the franchise and so all of those investments are paying off and we do expect to see deposit growth supporting our loan growth in the secondhalf of bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would just i would highlight that citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay john thanks for that and then bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island just one last quick piece of color is that very pleased to see private bank now has had kind of two quarters with billionplus of deposit growth and we certainly think that thats sustainable and could even accelerate so the ship has landed and were off to a great start we expect that to continue and even accelerate john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks bruce and then on the capital front good to see the resumption in buybacks the million in repurchases this quarter with cet1 here at around or when you dial in the aoci scenario how do you look at the likelihood of incremental buybacks from here in terms of pace of buybacks do you think that that could be reasonable given where youre sitting right now on cet1 thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think this capital position that we have generated and have maintained is really creating a lot of flexibility when you think about our capital waterfall i mean our top priority is to put capital to work that is to support and clients that is accretive to our cost of capital over time and thats really what we want to do and that were expecting to do and thats what capital allows us that flexibility it also cushions against uncertainties and so there have been a number we look at the macro and being at a very strong capital level to be there for our clients but also to cushion the downside to the extent uncertainties manifest is another use of a strong capital position when you get down into kind of other potential uses of the capital we support our dividend of course thats top of the list and then if were left with elevated capital levels then were able to give it back to shareholders which we did in the first quarter were planning to do that here in the second quarter and that flexibility will continue into the secondhalf so as we monitor loan demand and the macro that will play into the trajectory of buybacks in the secondhalf bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i would also just go back to an earlier comment that we have lets say a frontloaded plan this year because theres less loan growth in fact theres loan contraction earlier in the year that then turns around and we start to see loan growth in the secondhalf of the year that would by definition mean we need capital to support the loan growth and thered be less capacity for share repurchases but anyway we gave the you saw the million number in the first quarter john mentioned million in the second quarter and then well see where we get to in the secondhalf if the loan growth fully doesnt materialize we can actually just turn around and keep repurchasing stock john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks guys appreciate it citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thanks operator your next question will come from the line of peter winters sic peter winter with da davidson your line is now open peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning you guys maintained the net chargeoff guidance for the year but if we assume no rate cuts this year could it lead to higher net chargeoffs than forecasting just given kind of no relief on debt service coverage ratios or loans coming up for renewal at higher rates bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well what i would say on that is that the broad credit quality is still very good so if you look at our ci book thats in really good shape companies weathered the pandemic and leaned their business models locked in lower cost financing theyre doing more of that now early in the year so we dont really see hotspots even with kind of a higherforlonger scenario in ci similarly in consumer were still in very good shape the consumer is benefiting from still strong liquidity levels a strong labor market and so we havent seen any adverse migrations in delinquencies or npas or anything like that so thats the bulk of the loan portfolio if you then kind of look at the commercial real estate and the general office in particular thats relatively small as a percentage of the overall loan book and i think theres potentially some trends were watching the reports that returntooffice is picking up and so maybe theres a little counter trend in office that offsets the kind of additional burden of the higherforlonger but i think that the margin is not going to change that chargeoff number materially peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it and then john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i peter ill just second that from my side we made no assumptions in our forecast that were going to benefit from lower rates because we just didnt know and thats our credit policy we dont go out on the future curve we run all our scenarios based on where rates are today so i think weve got a peakish kind of rate environment if it lasts another couple of quarters or even another year i dont think its going to make a material difference to the way we forecast chargeoffs brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island the only point i would add on consumer is that our delinquency levels are actually net down yearoveryear  overq1 led mostly by resi but were seeing really no signs of stress on the book as bruce pointed out so i feel really good and even at a higherforlonger that unless theres a big economic shock that were in really good shape citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co and i just quickly just a followup on offices i guess i believe that more than half of the maturities on office happened this year so do you think net chargeoffs could peak towards the end of this year maybe early next year and then start to trend lower john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island its really hard to forecast that i think they will be early next year or late this year probably but it depends how much we extend how the negotiations go how much capital is put into some of these transactions and working through the book loanbyloan its i dont have the crystal ball to say exactly when the peak is but i would go back to what i said before is were comfortable how its kind of progressing and its progressing according to our expectations peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it thank you operator your next question will come from the line of ken usdin with jefferies your line is now open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning guys just a question on the fee side its really nice to see the capital markets improvement as you had been thinking as were seeing more broadly im just wondering a couple line items went well a couple items kind of went backwards just wondering just how youre thinking about the fee progression the drivers and whats your pipeline look like relative to the better start point here for the first quarter capital markets thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill start off and then others can jump in here but i mean the drivers i mean you look at the big three for us capital markets card fees and wealth trust and investment services are all trending well and we expect to be significant contributors in so each of those businesses have had significant strategic investment over the years and even more recently so its really nice to see the investments made in the capital markets business come to fruition we had a good strong quarter in the first quarter number one in the league tables on the sponsor side a big rebound from the fourth quarter and early in the second quarter the pace of activity has continued and we feel very good about the trends there not only for but for the fullyear in the card business weve made a strategic conversion to mastercard and thats driving a number of positive developments there and in the wealth business as you know all of the advisor hires the clarfeld acquisition from a number of years ago are all coming together along with the private bank to drive those flows throughout so were feeling quite good about the trajectory for fees citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would just say to your point ken also there were those three strong areas and then we had a little bit of weakness in some other areas service charges mortgage the global markets fx and interest rate lines were a little below our expectations the good news there is theres nothing structural that we worry about i think well see bounce backs over the rest of the year which will add to our overall growth and our confidence that well maintain strong fee performance for the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just one more followup on the nii and the swaps im just looking at your pages and from the deck its pretty clear that youre saying the increases youve made to the swap book are all incorporated in the guidance so that first quarter to fourth quarter million cumulative net interest income impact is that inclusive of everything that is both like active as of now and then will prospectively still come on as the year progresses john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah yeah it is and so what that is that million is made up of about million primarily driven from active swaps that are outstanding so theres about billion notional of active swaps outstanding that grows to about billion by thats incorporated into that number but then its offset by the positive benefit from noncore of about call it million or so or million to million coming from noncore and that gets you to the million drag but really when you play it out for the rest of the year again broadly net interest margin trends are coming in a little better incorporating all of our swap activity what you see on page is just the receivefixed swaps we actually have payfixed swaps in the securities portfolio that are offsetting this as well as of course everything thats happening in the core balance sheet so you got to kind of think at the broadest sense that nim trends are actually coming in a little better and then as you get out to later years you start getting all of this tailwind is really baked in and you start seeing the fact that terminated swaps begin to contribute it gets to the point where you get out into and that a majority of a super majority if you will of the tailwinds are actually baked in and arent ratedependent but you got that right in terms of the components that incorporates everything on the receivefixed swap side plus noncore bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and i think yeah go ahead bruce bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and i would just add a color there ken is i think coming into the year people were concerned about that stepup that we had forward starting swaps in  and then more in  the guide that were giving and our confidence in the nim outlook incorporate that so were able to absorb that because higherforlonger is better for the core citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 balance sheet we have some payfixed swaps we do it in the securities book so were able to absorb kind of that stepup in the swap book and continue to maintain confidence in the nim outlook for the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah thats great bruce and if i can just bring that all together so you broadly affirmed your broader guidance of down to down and we kind of know the first quarter and have the second quarter outlook so what would be the biggest swing factors within that range based on all these points that youre making about the nim coming in better and now knowing more of this detail about how the swaps will work bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah to me its really volume would be the keys to where we land in that range so do we actually see that strong growth in the private bank accelerating that could be strong for deposits and attractive deposit funding and then the spreads that theyre making on their loans is also very attractive so thats totally accretive to front book back book do we see the growth in commercial that we expect come in and i think we based on our kind of pipelines and our conversations with our customers and also a feeling that the sponsor community right now theres been a lot of pullforward and refinancing but i think youre going to start to see some more new money deals in the second half of the year so i think those volume factors will have a big impact but the way we kind of see it looking out the window today were highly confident that those things will materialize i dont know john if you want to add anything john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i agree with all that i would say that even with a little bit of lighter loan demand we still think that range is good maybe it comes at a higherend versus the lowerend but i mean think thats a swing factor all the other components of the balance sheet are playing out well our outlook for deposit mix and funding mix is underpinning the net interest margin i would hasten to add that those payfixed swaps that we added last quarter in and also in have really driven a really nice uptake in the securities yields you see the securities yields up almost basis points in the first quarter and thats offsetting thats a huge component of our balance sheet and thats a big driver and then i should also make clear that the core balance sheet is contributing as well where were seeing front book back book on the loan side that is in the range of basis points in the first quarter and youre getting front book back on the securities book of around basis points so there are good dynamics in the core balance sheet and all of the swaps are baked in bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and indiscernible ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 okay thanks for all that bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island we said could come in at the higher end i think you meant the better end john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thats just for everybodys clarity on that point john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay operator your next question will come from the line of matt oconnor pardon me im having technical difficulties your next question will come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning most of my questions have been answered but im curious when you talk about kind of this mediumterm net interest margin what are your thoughts on the size of the balance sheet and i guess specifically like do you think the overall balance sheet will grow or is there the remixing clearly youre running off the noncore book growing the private bank but do you envision kind of net balance sheet growth as you look out the next few years thank you john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah id say that we do expect the balance sheet to grow its i think we do have a balance sheet optimization program thats turning over a certain portion of the portfolio but when you look at the grand total of the initiatives that were putting in place you get i think you see interestearning assets will be growing in the secondhalf of the year and as you get out over the medium term so i think that we have the opportunity to optimize and grow and thats our expectation bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 yeah i would say the kind of flex point is kind of middle of the year when we have done a lot of that heavy lifting on repositioning and then we start to see the private bank growth and commercial bank as we discussed start to kick in so we should see net growth already in the secondhalf of the year and then kind of looking out to we would expect in a strong economy that we could get back to reasonably strong growth rates again being selective where we play focusing on primary relationships and primacy but theres no reason we couldnt grow back at nominal gdp the way we did for kind of many years before we hit the pandemic and that plays into matt the delivery of positive operating leverage which is part of how you get your return on equity up and so thats the model wed like to get back to matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it thank you operator your next question will come from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good morning this is thomas leddy calling on behalf of gerard circling back to capital deployment quickly you guys were pretty busy in in terms of strategic actions can you update us on how youre thinking about further investment opportunities for the franchise and how you guys prioritize organic growth versus team liftouts or even outright ma bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so i would say that right now we have a very full plate in terms of the things that were investing in the organic growth initiatives we have so i would not were not really looking much at inorganic situations or opportunities and so we want to just stay focused on great execution theres a big payoff for getting these initiatives right and theyre all trying to ph fund the trend line i would say team liftouts you mentioned is something that were hinting at at this point because while we have the private bank in place and we have clarfeld as part of the private wealth complex we need to scale up our private wealth capabilities into a large extent and so we are having discussions with teams and you can watch this space because i think youll start to see us build that part of the business out but again it will be prudent well treat them like theyre kind of ma transactions that are accretive and they fit our strategy and theyre good cultural fits but thats kind of the only thing i would say that were looking kind of outside and to some extent thats organic you could argue whether thats organic or whether its acquisitionlike but were kind of using the same acquisition lens on these as if they were small deals i dont brendan if you want to add any color on that brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island maybe two quick points one is that i just said the interest in citizens from a wealth management perspective is at a high like weve never seen before so were talking to some of the very best wealth managers across all the big brands in the united states so were going to be very selective but the interest in what were doing here is quite unique and distinctive so we expect to board some top talent and really give a boost to our wealth strategy citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 the point around capital that you mentioned ill just given that were mentally potentially thinking about the return metrics like we would in ma deal keep in mind that a liftout or what we do with the private bank really is a very de minimis impact on capital and so thats why that when you look when we talk about the breakeven of the private bank being secondhalf of this year its really just getting through the expense guarantees and getting the revenue throughput so it has a very de minimis impact on capital and the same will be true on wealth lift outs where the teams we bring onboard it will be a much more of expense guarantee mindset and getting them through their revenue curve versus having any real material impact on our capital bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great thats helpful color thank you and then just separately on loan growth ci demand has obviously been pretty tepid despite pretty healthy growth in the economy as measured by real gdp do you think that lack of ci loan demand is being driven by just general customer caution or are you guys seeing more competition from nonbank players like the private credit market and others bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think its just a general caution about whats going to happen in the economy whats going to happen with rates and i think most of our companies have had good years but theyre still expressing caution so were actually not losing business to private credit its interesting were actually its coming the other way because theres been opportunities to take out loans that are out with private credit and move them over to the bank syndicated lending market refinance those and kind of lock in lower cost financing so thats been a big part of the story here in the first quarter and its continuing into the second quarter don ph any color donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think thats right i think the area that we see private credit most active is in the leveraged buyout market which we dont hold a lot of that on our balance sheet anyway so theyre a source of distribution for us so weve actually done a couple deals in the first quarter where weve distributed into the private credit market so it doesnt have a balance sheet impact and it helps drive some of our fee lines thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great thank you for taking my questions bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 operator your next question will come from line pardon me the line of dave rochester with compass point your line is now open david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc earlier you mentioned that the flows were a major driving swing factor of that nii guide and i know you mentioned expecting a little less loan growth this year but you mentioned possibly hitting the better end of that nii range if for whatever reason net loan growth doesnt materialize in the backhalf and ci growth only ends up filling in for the runoff that youre expecting can you still hit that nii guide for the year bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes i mean i would say that were still confident in the range and so if things break our way we could be at the better side of that range if they dont we could be at the lower end of that range so id still kind of use that as the guardrails youd have to have kind of a quite a bit of deviation from expectation to fall outside of that range john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i agree and just to david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island just to reiterate that point what weve been saying is that we have an expectation that well come in at the better end of the range for net interest margin based on the trends that were seeing and the performance we were able to generate in the first quarter so you would see us being at the upperend of that range maybe a tad better on net interest margin thats offsetting the fact that theres some lighter loan demand that were also seeing that you put those together and were right down the middle there in terms of that range and we have got back to the point bruce just made and thats our base case now that were updating and there could be putsandtakes to that depending upon the volume point that bruce made earlier bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc perfect all right thanks guys bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay operator your next question comes from the line of david konrad with kbw your line is now open david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning sorry if i missed this earlier but just kind of drilling down on the nim discussion just looking at this quarter curious on ci yields dropped around bps quarteroverquarter i didnt think this is a heavy swap onboarding this quarter but just curious where were looking at that maybe in the next quarter before the swaps come on in the third quarter john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean really whats going on as youve hit it i would say just broadly i would try to make the point that all the swaps are incorporated into the nim guide and when you look at the underlying fundamentals of the loan book that the front book back book is driving an increase in loan yields exswaps so thats the first point as it relates to when you pull the swaps together from an accounting standpoint why there is a negative impact from the swap standpoint is that there was a mix shift we had the swap notionals didnt change much but we had some maturities at higher receives being replaced by some forward starters coming in at lower receive and that overall that net receive rate fell in the quarter and thats why you ended up with that negative impact just on that line itself but again overall net interest margin was flat for the quarter and when you put it all together with all the components we had a quite a strong net interest margin performance even incorporating that swap drag david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah i agree and then you talked about the securities book both the front book back book and then the pay floaters coming out but just curious your outlook for the growth of the securities book going forward john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think weve gotten to the point where we had the liquidity build late last year and thats basically largely done and so where you see the securities book right now as a percentage of our overall interestearning assets is about where well be over time as we grow loans well probably grow securities and cash on a similar mix basis from a volume standpoint but the percentage of cash and securities to overall interestearning assets at the end of the first quarter is about where well be for the rest of the year and i would hasten to add that when you look at that thats reflective of our deposit franchise and being primarily consumer and having a much higher proportion of insured secured deposits than most peers and then if you if you crank it all through the way the fed looks at standardized category banks our lcr incorporating all of that citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 at march was which is incredibly strong from a liquidity standpoint and that plays through based upon the balance sheet mix overall including cash and securities david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect thank you operator your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc maybe as a followup to the last question is there any change in how youre thinking through positioning in the mediumterm with the expectation for fewer rate cuts coming through so with loan growth being a little bit weaker right now deposit growth being pretty solid as you noted are you willing to put on a little bit more duration on the securities side and separately has it got cheaper to put in some downside protection on nim as you look into and and is that something youre considering right now john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would say on the securities side id say theres a couple of objectives being addressed and thats the interplay between capital and liquidity and interest rate risk management so what we did over the last couple of quarters is weve added billion of payfixed swaps thats paid off quite nicely because of our view that rates were likely not to be down whatever however many cuts we thought they were at the beginning of the year five six seven cuts we thought that was probably a little overcooked and so we put on those payfixed swaps in part related to that but in part related to the multiyear objective to reduce the duration on the securities book given how it will likely be treated from a capital standpoint and so both of those objectives came into play when we shortened the duration of the securities book which right now is about years were likely to continue to shorten the duration book of that securities book over time and get down to something closer to year or thereabouts and so thats really the driver there but youve got to look at the overall balance sheet and from an overall balance sheet standpoint it made sense to add a little asset sensitivity in the fourth quarter and the first quarter and at march we remain an assetsensitive balance sheet when it comes to adding downside protection in the outyears we do note that we have a significant dropoff of receivefixed swaps when you get out into and and i think entry points matter so if rates continue to stay elevated and we think theres value there we want to be careful that we dont give up our upside that the ci loan book provides us and we will do that when the entry points are attractive in terms of that trade and locking it in and in general that would be consistent with something that would be north of of the receive rate out into and and well be opportunistic as the rate environment plays out in terms of how we continue to protect the balance sheet over the mediumterm manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it very helpful and then this morning one of your peers suggested that theyre seeing corporate behavior shifting from nib to ib are you seeing some of your corporate clients take another look at optimizing their nib balances in the higherforlonger rate environment recently citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island i think its pretty much run its course at this point weve had a little bit of a shift in the book but its really slowed down i think the clients have been pretty opportunistic in terms of taking advantage of higher rates so id say our book and our mix is pretty stable right now and we expect it to stay here john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would say overall you saw our dda stable at at the end of at the end of thats important thats the first time this has happened in a while and so that stability we expect to continue as you get throughout for the rest of the year and actually see growth as we mentioned earlier based on our strategic
