wells fargo  company  wells fargo will pay million in penalties for charging customers too much for foreign currency transactions another fine for a bank that has struggled to shed its scandalmarred image federal prosecutors in manhattan said the bank had defrauded clients including many small or mediumsize businesses over seven years by adding markups giving false information and providing worse prices to lessexperienced customers in a statement late monday prosecutors said wells fargos sales staff members had been motivated by bonuses that could exceed million a year based on the revenue from foreign exchange the bank said in a statement that the conduct covered by the settlement had occurred before and that it had significantly improved its oversight and procedures related to foreign exchange transactions as part of the settlement the bank paid back million to customers it defrauded she wants the federal reserve to revoke a key operating license and force a split between wells fargos banking and wall street businesses senator elizabeth warren says wells fargo has run out of time to fix the many internal problems that have harmed its customers in a letter to the federal reserve chair jerome h powell on monday ms warren asked the fed to force the financial giant to break off its core banking activities like offering checking and savings accounts and loans from its other financial services divorcing wall streetcentric work which can include managing investment funds and providing financial market sales and trading services from the bank would ensure that wells fargos everyday customers did not continue to suffer ms warren wrote the fed could accomplish this she explained by revoking wells fargos financial holding company license essentially making it impossible for the company to operate any nonbanking businesses continuing to allow this giant bank with a broken culture to conduct business in its current form poses substantial risks to consumers and the financial system she wrote its the first time that ms warren a massachusetts democrat has made such a request to a regulator mr powell is unlikely to follow the suggestion at least in the near future wells fargo would somehow have to quickly shed dozens of nonbank subsidiaries which would certainly undermine the banks financial health but ms warrens request for such aggressive action hinted at the desire among progressives for a stronger regulatory hand from the fed and it comes as president biden is considering whether he will reappoint mr powell when his term ends early next year a fed spokesman confirmed that the central bank had received the letter a wells fargo spokeswoman responded to a request for comment by emailing journalists a list of steps the bank had taken since to change its management structure the list included replacing top managers splitting businesses into new groups with separate oversight creating a sales practices oversight protocol and speeding up restitution to customers it harmed wells fargo has spent years trying to right its standing with regulators and lawmakers after a cascade of disclosures of misconduct by the bank against its customers it admitted to opening accounts in their names without their knowledge forcing them to buy unnecessary insurance and charging them unwarranted mortgage fees the banks statement also pointed out that wells fargo had fulfilled two requirements for improvement that regulators had placed on it one from forced it to improve its antimoneylaundering oversight the other from required it to end harmful sales practices the idea of revoking the banks financial holding company license was first proposed two years ago by jeremy kress an assistant professor of business law at the university of michigans ross school of business he argued in an academic paper that since the fed requires institutions seeking such a license to have a high regulatory rating a or out of on a scale that federal regulators use to assess whether a bank is well managed any bank whose rating subsequently sinks lower should lose it in her letter ms warren pointed to a report from early revealing that wells fargos regulatory rating normally kept secret had fallen below the level at which the bank could be considered well managed she added that it was inconceivable that wells fargo could have recently improved its rating given its continuing problems last week federal regulators announced another set of fines and restrictions on the bank stemming from its inappropriate handling of some of its home loan customers portfolios the office of the comptroller of the currency found that wells fargos management of its mortgage accounts had been so sloppy that it might have improperly foreclosed on some borrowers homes the regulator fined the bank million ordered it to halt some foreclosures in progress and gave it five months to get its management systems on track ms warrens suggestion would be a much more significant penalty and would involve significant challenges said jaret seiberg an analyst for cowen washington research group the banking system has evolved considerably since congress allowed investment banks and commercial banks to get together years ago mr seiberg said these operations are now interwoven and its not as simple as saying you have to sell half the bank breaking up is hard to do but immediately revoking the banks license is not mr powells only option in an interview on tuesday professor kress said mr powell could direct fed officials to issue a new rule setting a limit two or three years for example on the length of time a company could operate with a low management rating and maintain its license it could set a precedent that this is a tool that the fed can use to hold banks accountable for financial misconduct mr kress said the fed has already taken drastic measures to try to force wells fargo to improve since early the bank has been operating under an asset cap which the fed vowed to keep in place until the bank could prove it had overhauled its riskmanagement procedures and established better protections for its customers but ms warren said the bank was distracted from that goal citing reports that wells fargo was trying to expand activities like putting together corporate mergers and other investment banking services the bank should be forced to give up those wall street pursuits to ensure that its leaders focus all of their attention on fixing the banks numerous chronic riskmanagement deficiencies she wrote wells fargo is the countrys fourthlargest bank though its wall street presence including investment banking and wealth management services is much smaller than those of competitors like jpmorgan chase and bank of america its chief executive charles w scharf has a wall street background and since taking over two years ago has tried to make wells fargo more profitable by steering it more toward wall street i am concerned that wells fargos senior executives are focused on expanding risky investment banking activities instead of remediating consumer harms and improving lax internal controls ms warren said though her letter to mr powell did not mention mr scharf by name ms warren sent a separate letter on monday to the chairman of wells fargos board of directors it asked for details about how the board is overseeing the banks cleanup efforts and why it is paying mr scharf so well he received more than million in the fiscal year even as the banks problems endure
