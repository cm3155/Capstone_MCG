wells fargo  company  federal inquiry focuses on wells fargos hiring practices authorities are investigating whether the bank violated federal antidiscrimination laws by conducting sham interviews of minority candidates federal prosecutors in new york have opened a criminal investigation into whether wells fargo violated federal laws by conducting sham interviews of minority and female job candidates according to two people with knowledge of the inquiry the investigation is being conducted by members of a newly created civil rights unit inside the criminal division of the manhattan us attorneys office the people said they requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly the investigation which is in its early stages was spurred by a may report in the new york times that centered on a whistleblower joe bruno mr bruno a former wells fargo employee and others said bank managers were interviewing job applicants whom the bank deemed diverse a catchall term for racial minorities women and members of other disadvantaged groups for roles that had already been promised to other people these sham interviews were the result of the banks quest to increase diversity a noble goal that became twisted in practice because some employees said it was more about recording the banks efforts to hire more minorities than actually hiring them the practice was tied to wells fargos diverse slate policy which stipulated that at least half the candidates interviewed for jobs paying or more needed to be diverse the rule was put in place in mid2020 however the practice of conducting fake interviews existed long before then because wells fargo had a similar unwritten policy a wells fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on the investigation it is not clear what if any charges could result from the investigation but it shows a new willingness by federal authorities to pursue criminal prosecutions of civil rights violations at a time when hate crimes are on the rise especially because the criminal code is seldom applied to the treatment of workers or customers by corporations the civil rights unit handling the wells fargo inquiry was created in november by damian williams the us attorney for the southern district of new york under federal law for instance it is a crime to interfere with an applicant for private employment in a way motivated by the applicants race color religion or national origin federal authorities typically cite civil antidiscrimination laws when bringing cases against companies for hiring discrimination also customers who find themselves mistreated because of their race rely mostly on state antidiscrimination laws to get justice in creating the civil rights unit mr williams said federal authorities needed to reconsider how the justice system treated issues of discrimination pursuing criminal cases he said would make efforts to get justice for victims of discrimination more effective at wells fargo one of the nations largest banks with nearly employees sham interviews occurred across multiple business lines including its mortgage servicing home lending and retail banking operations the times report last month focused on the banks wealth management business since then another current and former employees have shared stories about how they were subject to fake interviews or conducted them or saw paperwork documenting the practice the people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation from wells fargo or their current employers in an interview on monday bei ling wells fargos head of human resources said she did not believe the fake interview practice was a systematic issue employees had not complained about it she said during these past eight months i can tell you i have never heard such a thing from the recruiting community ms ling said i have never even heard the words fake interview she added that there was no way for the bank to understand the scope of the problem unless employees spoke up we cant act on things that we dont know she said in some instances there were written records of the practice of conducting fake interviews in late just days after wells fargo offered a job to a person who counted as diverse by the banks standards a human resources employee asked that person to apply for a different job at the bank according to an email reviewed by the times the first offer was still on the table the wells fargo employee explained but the bank also wanted to show that it had qualified candidates for both roles simply book keeping for us the employee wrote in the email when asked about the human resources employees message ms ling said were reviewing the communications on monday wells fargos chief executive officer charles w scharf announced that the bank would temporarily pause its diverse slate rule to study its implementation and make changes to prevent more fake interviews from being conducted the bank had already been experimenting with ways to streamline its hiring process in february wells fargo began a pilot program that did away with job postings and the diverse slate interview requirement in cases where internal candidates had been identified the goal was to make it easier for employees to move to new roles within the bank until then every job had to be posted and diverse candidates interviewed in keeping with the policy unless managers specifically applied for an exemption requiring approval from highlevel executives ms ling said the pilot program had nothing to do with problems arising from the diverse slate rule wells fargo has been working its way through an organizationwide cleanup of its business practices for the past five years beginning in it was publicly revealed that the bank had been opening fake accounts in customers names without their knowledge charging some of them bogus fees on mortgage loans and forcing others to buy unnecessary auto insurance the scandals have cost the bank more than billion in fines in early the federal reserve imposed an asset cap on wells fargo restricting it from growing until regulators were satisfied that its risk management practices and its treatment of customers had stabilized the banks leadership has turned over since then and mr scharf took over in the fall of regulators have still not given wells fargo the allclear its woes have continued a group of black homeowners recently sued the bank for stalling on refinancing their home loans the securities and exchange commission fined wells fargo million for failing to properly follow antimoneylaundering laws and rohit chopra the director of the consumer financial protection bureau put wells fargo atop a list of repeat offenders that he proposed should be stripped of their operating licenses because they were violating too many financial regulations senator warns wells fargo to shape up senator sherrod brown of ohio the chairman of the chambers banking committee rebuked charles w scharf for the banks continued problems the democrat in charge of the senate banking committee is not happy with wells fargos chief executive charles w scharf in a letter on tuesday the committees chairman senator sherrod brown of ohio demanded that mr scharf once and for all address wells fargos governance risk management and hiring practices weaknesses that have plagued the bank for almost a decade mr brown listed recent misbehavior by the bank including a report by the new york times that wells fargo had conducted sham interviews of black and female candidates and cited claims that it had avoided refinancing black homeowners mortgages while interest rates were low a wells fargo spokeswoman declined to comment mr brown also noted that wells fargo had failed to properly administer a system for alerting the authorities to suspicious activity by its brokerage customers the securities and exchange commission said on may that it was fining wells fargo million over violations of antimoneylaundering laws claiming the bank failed to file more than suspiciousactivity reports between and despite these failures wells fargo made billion in and announced a plan to double dividends and buy back billion in stock between third quarter and second quarter mr brown wrote mr brown noted that mr scharf received million last year in total compensation a percent increase from and times the median employee salary at the bank mr brown said he expected mr scharf to prepare a plan to fix its myriad problems and ended the letter with a reminder that the chief executive would be testifying soon along with his peers at the committees annual big bank oversight hearing a date for the hearing has not yet been announced rising rates hit mortgage lenders mortgage lenders are scrambling to survive a sharp dropoff in the number of homeowners refinancing their loans with demand drying up as interest rates rise mortgage giants including wells fargo co and rocket cos have trimmed staff this spring online lender bettercom has laid off or offered buyouts to about half of its workforce since december while home prices continue to rise and people are still buying houses the dropoff in refinancing activity is a giant blow because refinancings made up the bulk of us mortgage originations throughout the pandemic some lenders are considering selling themselves convinced it is the only way to make it through according to industry executives and advisers many lenders are losing money and have the prospect of losing money for the foreseeable future said steve stein a former executive at stearns lending a mortgage company based in lewisville texas partnering up could be a good strategic alternative last month mr stein and former stearns chief executive david schneider launched an advisory firm to guide what they believe will be a wave of lenders looking to stay afloat some lenders are selling assets such as their rights to collect mortgage payments others are trying to drum up business by offering lower rates or cutting their fees in march mortgage lenders made in profit on every of a loan the smallest amount since according to the urban institute in that figure was as high as you saw lenders panic a bit with the decline in originations said richard martin director of realestate lending solutions at curinos a financialservices research firm the mortgage markets slowdown is another consequence of the federal reserves attempts to curb redhot inflation the fed has raised interest rates twice this year to try to cool the economy and it ended its largest mortgagebond buying program this spring that has pushed up borrowing costs for mortgages drying up the pandemic refinancing boom and even shoving some wouldbe home buyers out of the market originations at the largest lenders fell in the first quarter from a year earlier according to industryresearch firm inside mortgage finance mortgage volume is expected to fall in according to the mortgage bankers association driven by the drop in refinancings it could get worse the housing market still looks hot by historical standards and home prices are still rising but the feds moves have raised questions about whether the us is headed toward a recession which would likely slow home sales and make it difficult for some homeowners to keep up with their monthly payments aprils seasonally adjusted annual rate of home sales was the lowest since june its like the music has stopped said jeff taylor a managing partner at mphasis digital risk a consulting firm that works with mortgage lenders on technology and risk the average rate on a 30year fixedrate mortgage was as of last week according to mortgagefinance giant freddie mac up from near the beginning of the year an increase that can add hundreds of dollars each month to a new buyers borrowing costs the pain is expected to be especially bad for nonbank mortgage lenders unlike banks they dont have numerous business lines to carry them through mortgage downturns they also dont take deposits which means they are reliant on shortterm loans seven of the largest refinance lenders in were nonbanks according to inside mortgage finance a few nonbanks are big names such as rocket which is now the biggest mortgage lender in the us but there are thousands of smaller lenders scattered throughout the country they are often the preferred route to homeownership for moderateincome families or firsttime home buyers nonbanks issued about of us mortgages last year the highest share on record according to inside mortgage finance it is common for lenders to lay off workers when interest rates rise like they did in and then hire again when rates fall however in the runup to mortgage companies instead lowered lending standards to keep volume high laying the seeds for the global financial crisis this time around lenders have kept their standards for mortgage loans relatively strict its been decades since rates rose so quickly so its kind of a shock said tom millon ceo of computershare loan services a mortgageservice provider some of the measures lenders are taking to stem the bleeding are shortterm solutions cash from the sale of servicing rights by which a company earns fees for performing the backoffice job of collecting monthly payments can help pad lenders bottom line but selling those rights also
