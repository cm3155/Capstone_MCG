call over to charlie charles william scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning everyone thank you john im going to open the call by reviewing what is clearly a very poor quarter for us ill review the drivers of our results make some comments about the environment and discuss the rationale for the intended dividend reduction ill then turn the call over to john to review second quarter results in more detail our view of the length and severity of the downturn deteriorated considerably from our assumptions at the end of the first quarter and this as well as the knockon impacts from covid substantially impacted our results this quarter we added billion to the allowance for credit losses chargeoffs increased million from the prior quarter to billion net interest income was down from the prior quarter driven primarily by lower rates the constraints of operating under the asset cap has limited our ability to offset lower rates with balance sheet growth and we actually took actions during the quarter to limit loan and deposit growth which john will highlight expenses included approximately million related to decisions we made due to covid most of which we do not expect to be permanent but was the right thing to do for employees and to improve the safety of our facilities about million of deferred comp with an offset in fee revenue billion of operating losses primarily for wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 customer remediation accruals related to our ongoing work to remediate the historical issues in community banking as we took another look under new leadership at outstanding matters this accrual will enable us to do the right thing for our customers while resolving these matters as quickly as possible revenues were lower by about million due to covidrelated fee and interest waivers for certain products in addition a strong quarter of mortgage production revenue was partially offset by a million writedown of our mortgage servicing rights asset due to higher projected defaults and faster prepayment assumptions and while its a smaller part of the company we did had record revenues this quarter in our corporate and investment bank even with the loss this quarter our cet1 ratio increased to from last quarter and is well above our regulatory minimum of as a reminder our regulatory minimum reflects our expected stress capital buffer of the minimum possible as you know wells fargo is predominantly a us bank that takes deposits and makes loans our balance sheet composition is cash loans and our investment portfolio when consumers small businesses middlemarket companies and corporates suffer we do as well as the economic environment brought on by covid negatively impacts our customers and clients it will filter through to our results primarily in the form of outsized credit losses and compressed net interest margins additionally given we operate with a balance sheet cap we must prioritize balance sheet capacity both assets and deposits and theres certainly an opportunity cost for us in an environment like this in addition given the uncertainty of the recovery we must manage the balance sheet to a level where we can remain below the asset cap even if theres another period of material loan drawdowns or upward pressure on our deposit base having said that we are responsible for the position were in the balance sheet cap exists because leadership failed to both oversee and build the appropriate infrastructure of the company and our financial underperformance is because leadership didnt make the difficult decisions necessary we are focused on both of these we still have much to do to build the right risk and control foundation which is what our regulators expect and nothing can or will stand in the way of those activities it is our highest priority but we also recognize that weve been extremely inefficient for too long and we will begin to take decisive actions none of which will impact our risk and regulatory work to increase our margins so the first point we continue to make meaningful changes to improve the foundation of the company in the second quarter we announced corporate risk organizational structure to provide greater oversight of all risk taking activities and a more comprehensive view of risk across the company our new risk model will have five lineofbusiness chief risk officers to complement the teams and leaders by risk type during the quarter we hired a new chief operational risk officer a new chief risk officer for consumer lending and a chief control executive we continued to add additional talent to the senior leadership team since i joined the company nine months ago ive announced six new members to the operating committee all coming from outside of wells fargo with strong and relevant industry experience over twothirds of our operating committee have joined wells fargo since all of our business lines ceos are now in place including mike weinbach who joined wells fargo in may as ceo of consumer lending and barry sommers who joined at the end of june as ceo of wealth and investment management lester owens will be joining us next week in a newlycreated role as head of operations lester has more than years of experience in the financial services industry in senior operations roles he will be responsible for building more integrated approach to wells fargos business operations functions he has a proven track record in delivering a better customer experience while driving substantial efficiencies at the same time wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 we also made significant hires and roles one down from our operating committee including a new head of government relations corporate communications and corporate responsibility as well as chief administrative officer and a new head of our home lending businesses we continue to have over employees working from home and we plan to have employees who are currently working from home continue to do so until at least september it is too early to determine exactly when we will ultimately return to a more traditional work environment but we will be cautious about bringing people back into the office while i do believe there are meaningful benefits of people working physically together we will move forward when were comfortable that the health risks are manageable where there is a specific need we will do so with the appropriate safety precautions in place and we will make these decisions by geography by facility weve done this since the beginning of the crisis and we will continue to do so and serve our customers and communities weve made significant accommodations for our customers through the end of june we have helped more than million consumer and small business customers by deferring payments and waiving fees this includes over million of payment deferrals representing more than billion in principal and interest including billion in mortgage loans serviced for others we provided approximately million fee waivers for consumer and small business customers exceeding million for our commercial clients we processed approximately deferrals representing more than billion of principal and interest payments in addition for commercial distribution and auto finance customers we provided maturity date extensions representing approximately billion of outstanding principal and interest through the end of june we have funded ppp loans totaling billion with an average loan size of of those were for loan amounts of less than of those were for companies that had fewer than employees have less than million in annual revenues and were to companies in low and moderateincome areas or at least minority census tracks and we announced last week our open for business fund we have committed to donating approximately million in gross processing fees earned from the payroll protection plan to help support businesses impacted by the covid19 pandemic and we will work with nonprofit organizations to provide capital technical support and longterm resiliency programs to small businesses with an emphasis on serving minorityowned businesses customer deposits have continued to increase reflecting unprecedented government stimulus programs lower spending and customers converting investments into cash while commercial deposits declined reflecting actions we took to manage under the asset cap which john will describe in more detail in march our commercial customers utilized over billion of their loan commitments during the market turbulence at the onset of the pandemic and almost all of those loans were paid down in the second quarter debit card spend started to increase in april and returned to precovid levels in may and in the last full week of june were up approximately from the same week a year ago consumer credit card spend improved steadily starting in midapril but was still down approximately from a year ago as of the end of june commercial card spend remained significantly lower throughout the second quarter and was still down over in the last full week of june compared to the same week a year ago with declines across industry segments we continue to monitor our consumer and commercial customer spending trends as the nation goes through the various stages of reopening trends in digital usage are strong mobile deposit dollar volume was up over in the second quarter compared with a year ago in the second quarter digital logins were up from a year ago wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 let me turn to the dividend now today we announced that our board expects to reduce our dividend for the third quarter to per share the federal reserve has authorized banks to pay common stock dividends that do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the banks net income for the four preceding calendar quarters based on these instructions we previously announced that this limitation would cause us to reduce the dividend from the current level of a share in addition while this requirement currently applies to the third quarter the federal reserve stated it reserves the right to extend the limitations as it learns more about the evolution of the covid event separately from this our board has been reviewing the level of the dividend and ive discussed the way in which we would approach evaluating the right goforward level we first would look at our capital position as i said our capital position remains quite strong so our current capital level is not the driving factor in our decision having said that as we look forward we do not pretend to have a deeper understanding of the path of the recovery than others using our economic assumptions our capital levels remain above the minimum required and our ccar results confirm the strength of our capital position but we believe its prudent to note that our assumptions are just that so we felt it was appropriate to factor this uncertainty into our thinking around the appropriate dividend level in this environment after evaluating our capital position we considered our current and expected earnings level we expect the impact of covid to continue to negatively impact our earnings until we see a clear trend of meaningful improvements in unemployment and gdp this will result in continued lower levels of nii and certain economically sensitive fee revenues as well as potentially unforeseen expenses to operate in this environment in addition while our acl is intended to cover expected losses based on our current economic assumptions were mindful of the uncertainty and the need to reevaluate these assumptions continually and ill discuss this more but while we have actively begun to address the fact that our expenses are significantly too high it will take some time to see the impact of our actions in our results putting this all together it is critical in these uncertain times that our common stock dividend reflects current earnings capacity assuming a continued difficult operating environment evolving regulatory guidance and protects our capital position if economic conditions were to further deteriorate given this we believe its prudent to be extremely cautious until we see a clear path to broad economic improvement were confident that this eventual economic improvement combined with our actions to increase our margins will allow our wonderful franchise to support a higher dividend in the future were extremely disappointed to take this action and do understand that many rely on this stream of income however we must be prudent in this environment i have acknowledged in the past that our expenses are too high and that were building roadmaps to improve our efficiency ratio to repeat there is nothing structurally different about wells fargo that should prevent us from being as efficient as our large peers but we are far from it for us to bring our level of efficiency close to our peers the math would tell you we need to eliminate over billion of expenses while our work is not yet complete to commit to specific numbers and time frames we expect to take a series of actions beginning in the second half of the year to begin to reduce our expense base and bring our expenses in line with the size and composition of our businesses this will be a multiyear effort for sure but wed like to see a reduction in expenses next year and now we now have a centralized team driving the effort across the enterprise and our lines of business and functional areas have dedicated resources stacked against this this work did not start in the last few months but the extremely challenging operating environment and uncertain outlook has accelerated our sense of urgency it is important to note that i deeply believe that this exercise is about making us a better and more efficient company not just about reducing expenses we have too many management layers spans of controls for wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 managers are too narrow and we have resources dedicated to activities that are not a priority today this cannot continue we also have the opportunity to apply lessons we have learned since the onset of the pandemic to drive efficiency across the company over the mediumterm we have the opportunity to materially reduce our expense including increasing digital adoption for retail and commercial clients reducing thirdparty spend consolidating locations including branches field offices and corporate sites and applying technology differently in addition the opportunity to consolidate our operational platforms is still meaningful as a financial company and specifically a gsib we must be strong financially to serve our customers and support our communities but also to provide growing opportunities for our employees and while our balance sheet is strong our margins are too narrow to ensure were that source of strength we need to begin to take action to improve our results as ive said and ill say it again we will not do anything that will impact the work we have underway to build out our risk and control environment the opportunity to become more efficient exists elsewhere in the organization and we will protect this work at all costs ill continue to share more specifics about our plans as they develop and we will be talking more about this next quarter while there remains much economic uncertainty many market liquidity trends are strong as fed programs continue to effectively support the smooth functioning of the capital markets while still wide to precrisis levels market spreads have continued to improve since the peak of the dislocation and have retraced to of their midmarch widening liquidity in treasury and interest rate swap markets returned to precrisis levels and the feds open market purchase program has stabilized mortgage basis valuations and improved liquidity hqla bidask measure of the cost to transfer risk has retraced to precrisis levels while measures of volatility are now below precrisis levels however the economic recovery will not be smooth much of the economy is still essentially closed or just beginning to open and additional restrictions are being implemented as the spread of the virus continues to increase in many areas of the world while consumer spending has increased from levels at the end of the first quarter it is still down from a year ago with significant declines in areas like travel entertainment and restaurants and while government stimulus programs provided a safety net for many they are scheduled to runoff raising the possibility of more economic hardship ahead having said all of this cities communities people and businesses are all learning what it takes to reopen safely and there is progress on vaccines and therapeutics we will do what we can to support the fastest recovery possible but well be cautious in our outlook until we see the facts i want to conclude my comments today by discussing an important topic racial injustice in my conversations with different groups over the past months the pain and frustration with the lack of progress within both our country and wells fargo is clear inequality and discrimination has been clearly exposed and must not continue wells fargo has not been effective in creating enough diversity or consistently inclusive environment and ive outlined a number of actions we are taking around race to change the outcomes including creating a new role audio gap which will have a broad mandate of driving diversity inclusion in both the workplace but also our business well be evaluating operating committee members based upon their progress in improving diverse representation inclusion in their area of responsibility and it will have a direct impact on yearend competition decisions and weve announced the donation of these gross processing fees for ppp estimated to be approximately million this is just the beginning of the work needed to address this crisis and to meaningfully contribute to the change that is necessary but i believe that this is a watershed moment and we will be part of making sure this time is wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 different finally i want to thank all of the employees at wells fargo who continue to work tirelessly to serve our customers and successfully execute on our priorities i will now turn the call over to john john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thanks charlie and good morning everyone charlies comments covered most of the information on page of the supplement including the largest driver of our reported loss which was the billion increase in the allowance for credit losses in the second quarter so let me highlight just a couple things here first our income taxes in the second quarter reflected the impact of annual income tax benefits primarily tax credits driven by our reported pretax loss as a result we currently expect our effective income tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately excluding the impact of any discrete items also deferred compensation plan investment results increased net gains from equity securities by million and increased personnel expense by million as weve highlighted many times while these hedges are largely plneutral they can result in large swings in our reported revenue and expense trends in latemay we entered into arrangements to transition these economic hedges from equity securities to derivatives in the form of total return swaps as a result of this change starting in the third quarter our reporting for this item will be less volatile since most of the accounting impact from deferred comp hedges will be reported in personnel expense turning to page charlie covered the support were providing to our customers and communities during the pandemic but let me just highlight that the approximately million donation for small business recovery efforts we announced last week through the new open for business fund will be donated when the gross fees are recognized in revenue turning to page while our earnings in the second quarter were significantly impacted by the economic environment our capital and liquidity continued to be strong with both our cet1 ratio and lcr increasing from the first quarter our cet1 ratio increased to basis points above our current regulatory minimum of we expect our stress capital buffer to be which is the lowest possible under the new framework and would result in the regulatory minimum for our cet1 ratio remaining at even with the large increases in our allowances over the past two quarters our cet1 level was billion above the regulatory minimum our lcr increased to percentage points above our regulatory minimum and our primary unencumbered sources of liquidity were approximately billion turning to loans on page similar to industry trends periodend consumer and commercial loans outstanding declined in the second quarter but average balances grew reflecting increases in outstanding balances late in the first quarter ill explain the drivers of consumer and commercial periodend loan balances in more detail starting with consumer on page consumer loans were down billion or from the first quarter this decline includes the reclassification of billion of conforming first mortgage loans to heldforsale status to provide flexibility to manage our balance sheet under the asset cap the economic slowdown from covid19 reduced consumer spending and was reflected in lower credit card balances lower auto originations and other revolving and installment loan balances wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 in addition we took actions during the second quarter to tighten credit standards given the current economic environment and to manage to the constraints of the asset cap these actions included no longer purchasing jumbo mortgage loans through our correspondent mortgage business and not accepting home equity and personal line of credit applications in the auto business weve taken actions to mitigate future loss exposure and our spreads on new originations improved to their highest levels since that said as states began to reopen later in the quarter we saw increased loan demand including higher credit card spending and higher auto loan originations turning to commercial loans on page ci loans declined billion or from the first quarter driven by paydowns of revolving loans following increased loan draws in the first quarter during the market turbulence at the onset of the pandemic as charlie highlighted almost all of the billion of loan draws in march were paid down during the second quarter these paydowns were partially driven by strength in capital markets and helped drive record revenues in the second quarter in our corporate and investment bank commercial real estate loans increased billion from the first quarter with growth in both commercial real estate mortgage and in construction loans turning to deposits on page the industry has experienced very strong growth but due to our asset cap constraint weve worked to manage growth of certain lower liquidity value deposit categories however even after these actions average deposits grew from a yearago and from the first quarter the linkedquarter growth was driven by noninterest bearing deposits which were up while interestbearing deposits declined periodend consumer and small business banking deposits grew billion from the first quarter this strong growth reflected covid19related impacts including customers preference for liquidity loan and tax payment deferrals which otherwise would have reduced deposits stimulus checks and lower consumer spending wholesale banking deposits declined billion reflecting actions we took to manage under the asset cap including an emphasis on reducing certain nonoperational deposits average deposit costs declined to basis points down basis points from the first quarter with declines across all of our lines of business while wholesale banking deposit costs declined the most reflecting higher deposit betas both wim and retail banking deposit costs also declined we currently have no active retail banking promotions and we expect deposit costs will continue to decline in the secondhalf of this year and reach the singledigit lows realized in and net interest income declined billion or from the first quarter due to balance sheet repricing driven by the impact of a lower interest rate environment million less favorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results driven by large interest rate changes million of higher mbs premium amortization due to higher prepayment rates and these declines were partially offset by a shift to a lowercost mix of funding net interest income was down for the first half of the year and as i discussed in june we currently expect net interest income to be in the billion to billion range for the full year which would be down to from the full year of this decline reflects the lower interest rate environment and the constraints the asset cap places on our ability to grow the size of our balance sheet as well as higher mbs premium amortization which we expect to persist for the remainder of the year wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 turning to page noninterest income increased billion or from the first quarter driven by a billion increase in net gains from equity securities reflecting lower securities impairment and higher deferred compensation plan investment results ill explain some of these drivers in more detail deposit service charges were down million from the first quarter driven by covid19 related impacts including lower overdrafts as customers have reduced debit card transactions and increased deposit balances as well as higher fee waivers trust and investment fees declined million from the first quarter investment banking had a strong quarter with revenue increasing million or driven by strength in debt and equity capital markets this growth was more than offset by both lower retail brokerage advisory fees which were priced at the beginning of the second quarter when market levels for advisory assets were pricing were lower and declined in brokerage transactional revenue mortgage banking revenue was relatively stable linkedquarter with strong growth in mortgage loan originations more than offset offset by declines in servicing income total residential heldforsale originations increased from the first quarter to billion primarily driven by lower mortgage interest rates lower interest rates drove strong industry volume with second quarter estimated to be the largest origination market since the third quarter of as we managed our application pipeline to handle this strong demand our margins increased in the second quarter our production margin on residential heldforsale mortgage loans was basis points up from basis points in the first quarter weve continued to add capacity and expect originations to increase in the third quarter if rates remain low and we would expect margins to be relatively stable with second quarter levels servicing revenue declined million from the first quarter the decline was driven by a lower valuation of our msr asset as a result of updated assumptions including higher prepayment assumptions and higher expected servicing costs due to an increase in projected defaults servicing fees were also lower due to payment deferrals and fee waivers provided to our customers in response to the pandemic finally net gains from trading activities increased million from higher trading volumes across many products increased volatility leading to wider bidoffer spreads and substantial spread and price improvement in certain capital markets turning to expenses on page as charlie highlighted our expenses are too high and were beginning to take further action to improve our efficiency the billion increase in our expenses from the first quarter was driven by higher operating losses as well as higher personnel expense reflecting a million increase in deferred comp expense charlie described the billion of operating losses which included million of customer remediation accruals for a variety of matters as well as higher litigation accruals the million increase in personnel expense included the increase in deferred compensation which is pl neutral and million of covid19related employee expenses including premium pay for those who had to come into the office and payments for backup childcare most of the covid19related employee expenses have now expired we also had million of higher covid19related occupancy expense to make our properties safer for our employees and customers including enhanced cleaning additional supplies and workstation modifications these costs will likely remain elevated until the pandemic ends the impact of covid19 also reduced some of our expenses including travel and entertainment and advertising and promotion expense wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 turning to our business segments starting on page as charlie highlighted we now have the leadership for our five business segments in place and we will transition to reporting our segments in accordance with the structure starting in the third quarter community banking reported a net loss of million driven by an increase in provision expense on page we provide our community banking metrics we had billion digital active customers up from a year ago while the number of digital customers remain stable from the first quarter these customers are doing more digitally with logins up from the first quarter and the number of checks deposited using a mobile device reaching a record high in the second quarter up from the first quarter approximately of our branches are temporarily closed due to covid19 as a result of fewer branches being open and increased digital usage teller and atm transactions were down from the first quarter and from a year ago however we still have approximately million teller transactions occurring at our branches every business day our customers demand for cash has decreased by approximately compared to a year ago this decrease was reflected in lower demand for cash in our branches while atm transaction volume was down the amount of cash withdrawn at our atms has increased reflecting higherlevels of cash per withdrawal in part driven by the higher atm withdrawal limits we implemented in the first quarter charlie highlighted the improving trends we experienced during the second quarter for debit and credit card spend higher debit card spend later in the quarter resulted in total second quarter spend being flat compared with a year ago however transaction volume was down from a year ago with customers spending more per transaction as a reminder debit card fees are based on transaction volume not dollar volume turning to page wholesale banking reported a net loss of billion as revenue growth was more than offset by an increase in provision for credit losses ive already discussed the drivers on loans and deposits so let me highlight a few other business drivers corporate and investment banking capital markets had record revenue in the second quarter driven by the trading revenue increases i described earlier and record investmentgrade debt issuance wells fargo capital finance was the number one book runner of assetbased loans with yeartodate market share increasing to we maintained our leadership position in this market by providing an important source of liquidity to our customers during a very challenging time wealth and investment management earned million in the second quarter down from the first quarter primarily driven by an increase in the allowance for credit losses the lower interest rate environment and lower market valuations at the beginning of the quarter we continued to experience strong demand from clients for liquidity products with growth in deposits and money market funds and our asset management business wells fargo asset management achieved a record high billion in assets under management in the second quarter up from the first quarter driven by continued momentum in the money market business higher market valuations and fixed income net inflows while advisory assets in our brokerage business increased during the quarter we had lower retail brokerage advisory fees since theyre priced at the beginning of the quarter when market valuations were lower these fees will benefit from the stronger markets at the beginning of the third quarter turning to credit results for the company on page our net chargeoff rate was up basis points from the first quarter to basis points which is still a historically low level particularly during an extremely challenging wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 economic environment keep in mind that the significant amount of customer accommodations weve provided for our consumer and commercial customers since the start of the pandemic will delay the recognition of net charge offs delinquencies and nonaccrual status for those customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status however i will point out that this dynamic was considered in our allowance for credit losses commercial criticized assets increased billion or from the first quarter with ci up billion and cre up billion nonaccrual loans increased billion from the first quarter driven by growth in commercial nonaccruals i would note that of our commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest and principal as of the end of the second quarter we provide more detail on ci nonaccrual loans on page while ci loans outstanding and total commitments declined from the first quarter nonaccrual loans increased driven by oil and gas and real estate and construction ci loans which includes credit facilities to reits and other nondepository financial institutions last quarter we provided more details on industries with escalated monitoring and those industries largely drove the increase in criticized assets in the second quarter including retail entertainment and recreation turning to our community real estate portfolio on slide we are the nations largest commercial real estate lender and our portfolio is well diversified both by property type and geography our commercial real estate loans are subjected to rigorous underwriting standards and are well structured before covid19 this portfolio was performing at historically strong credit levels with a good mix of assets and geography a wellcapitalized customer base and overall low levels of leverage we had proactively reduced our exposure to retail and have minimal exposure to land or condos where losses were highest in the last cycle since the pandemic began weve worked to assist customers on a casebycase basis weve continued our strict routine monitoring process with the goal of identifying problems early our cre team has an experienced bench with workout backgrounds and perspective in times of distress which has enabled us to ramp up quickly however these are unprecedented times and nonaccruals were up million or from the first quarter given whats been going in the economy its not surprising that shopping centers retail and hotels motels accounted for of nonaccrual loans in the second quarter and accounted for of the increase from the first quarter criticized assets were up billion or from the first quarter driven by the same sectors that drove the increase in nonaccruals with the addition of office buildings turning to our oil and gas portfolio on page oil and gas loans accounted for of our total loans outstanding with billion outstanding at the end of the quarter down from the first quarter total commitments were down billion from the first quarter reflecting the impact of spring redetermination changes on borrowing bases proactive portfolio management as well as the weaker credit environment net chargeoffs increased million from the first quarter with of second quarter net chargeoffs from the ep sector nonaccrual loans increased million from the first quarter with approximately of nonaccruals still current on payments criticized loans increased from the first quarter reflecting downward credit migration resulting from commodity price volatility and included numerous credit downgrades of publiclyrated companies on page we provide detail on our allowance for credit losses the billion increase included billion for commercial loans and billion for consumer loans our allowance coverage for total loans was up wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 basis points from the end of the first quarter with the largest increases across commercial loans junior lien mortgage loans and credit card loans we highlight the key drivers of the increase in our allowance for credit losses on page we considered current economic conditions which worsened significantly compared to prior expectations as unemployment levels reached in the second quarter in addition over trillion in fiscal stimulus programs as well as customer accommodations provided nearterm support for borrowers on this page we provide details on the economic forecasts in our base case scenario for the second quarter allowance which assumes nearterm economic stress recovering into late including unemployment levels declining to approximately by the fourth quarter of while housing prices are forecasted to remain relatively stable commercial real estate prices are forecasted to decline by low to midteens with hotel restaurant and retail sectors expected to decline much further in addition collateral prices remain highly uncertain given limited property sales while the large majority of weight is placed on the base case scenario we applied some weighting to a downside scenario to reflect the uncertainty in the economic forecast and as i previouslymentioned customer forbearance and other deferral activities provided in response to covid19 were considered in our loan portfolio performance expectations and loss forecast however please keep in mind that our allowance for credit losses is influenced by a variety of factors including changes in loan volumes portfolio credit quality as well as general economic conditions while the timing of the end of the pandemic and the eventual path to economic recovery remain unclear we believe that our allowance captures the expected loss content in our portfolio as of the end of the second quarter turning to capital on page as i highlighted earlier our cet1 ratio increased to in the second quarter we elected to apply the modified cecl transition provision to our regulatory capital the impact of this selection was the increase in capital of billion and a basis point increase in our cet1 ratio additionally as a result of senior debt issuance during the second quarter and a decline in our rwa our tlac ratio increased to which provides a significant buffer to our required minimum of in summary our results from the second quarter were disappointing and economic conditions remain uncertain but were focused on doing the work necessary to improve the earnings capacity of the company including reducing our expenses while meeting our regulatory commitments and charlie and i will now take your questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of erika najarian with bank of america please go ahead erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch yes good morning my first question is a clarification question for charlie charlie during your prepared remarks you noted that your expenses were about billion greater than your peers or where you you need to be to be equivalent to peers on efficiency are you saying that lopping off billion in expenses is an eventual long term goal for this company to be in line with your larger peers charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well i mean what i said was that the math if you do the math what it says is that when you look at their efficiency ratios versus ours our expenses are at least billion higher than they should be and theres no reason why that should occur and so we are doing the work to create a roadmap for a company which is significantly more efficient exactly what the timeframe is and where we ultimately get to i think that well provide more information on when the future play itself out but we can do the same math that you can do and theres no reason why as a management team we dont have the ability to be as efficient as the rest erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thats clear and my followup question has to do with is the potential for the fed to extend the income test beyond third quarter dividend and im wondering so as we think about you mentioned that expenses should start coming down in as i think about how consensus is formulating future earnings power i think consensus is expecting that your the majority of your reserve build should be behind you but i dont think that restructuring costs for example that would relate to future efficiency initiatives are in with consensus and i guess the question that im really asking here is that if the fed extends the income test beyond the third quarter do you feel confident that according to how theyre looking at dividend capacity the is supportable going forward john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure this is john they certainly have the ability to extend the current framework and frankly it even seems likely just given the way the calendar lines up and the resubmission process is going to work for the next ccar i think charlies point is were going to do whats necessary to get as efficient as we can be and to the extent that that kicks off onetime charges which you might expect and if that has an influence on our dividend capacity as a result of the fed keeping the current regime in place then well have to tolerate that i dont think were not going to do whats right economically because of accounting consequences were going to do were going to follow gaap were going to get as efficient as we can the outcomes going to be the outcome in part weve set the current dividend or proposed to set the current dividend where it is so that it would buy us plenty of room to operate while we get through the next few quarters and chart the eventual path to greater wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 profitability but accounting consequences will be what they are it wasnt a primary consideration in setting the number where we did charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co the only thing i would add is i think is that when we think of the work that we did we didnt our board didnt approach this conversation around the dividend with an idea of looking at it each quarter and making a determination and so our hope is that this does become a level which is sustainable as we go through this period of uncertainty and as the fed decides how they want to treat capital return over the next series of quarters we do have some items that impact our capital our ability to return capital with this rule that doesnt reflect our earnings power going forward right we had a billion settlement with the department of justice which is in our historical numbers that billion when you look at it is something like round numbers a share of a negative that ultimately will roll out and is already actually in our capital number so we have these dynamics that the board thought about when we set the dividend level for the quarter that dont relate to the future earnings capacity of the company even as we look out into erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you for the clear answers operator your next question comes from the line of john mcdonald of autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah hi good morning john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hi john john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research good morning john could you remind us just where you are on the asset cap flexibility what needs to be done each quarter now with deposits coming in and some loan demand and what kind of flexibility you have to operate under that and where you are today on the way it gets measured thanks john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure sure so we were in compliance with it at the end of the second quarter and the items that we did during the late first and early second quarter to maintain compliance were really focused on our wholesale funding footprint by shrinking the amount of external repo and other financing that we do in taking trading assets down and we had a focus on certain categories of nonoperational deposits the ones that have very low liquidity value and its really this is from this point forward this is more of a liability management exercise to make sure that we dont retain too much in the way of low liquidity value deposits that were thoughtful about other liabilities wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 on the asset side theres so much cash on the balance sheet right now that it gives plenty of flexibility i think to do what we need to do with loans you saw that our lcr print was for the quarter and deposits have grown nicely so were very thoughtful and cautious about how we price deposits about those that have low liquidity value were thoughtful about maturities as they come up in nondeposit funding because with the inflow of deposits we can rely more on that and less on notes and institutional cds and other things thats the work that weve been doing and thats the path that we have for the next quarter or two john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and you reiterated the net interest income outlook for the year how should we think about kind of the jumping off point for the net interest margin and net interest income as we go into next quarter what are some of the puts and takes that we should factor into the model john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i think its going to be relatively flat from where it is today were sort of were in that zone and as i said billion to billion for the year still feels like the right number so i think itll be were not really carefully managing the nim its were looking for the dollars and net interest income but it shouldnt deviate too much from where we are right now john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay got it and is there anything in terms of asset cap progress charlie can comment on i know you cant say too much but in terms of the work being done and progress in doing what you need to do to satisfy the fed charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co john i appreciate everyone being interested given the limitations of it and asking the question its going to be the same response every single quarter which is were focused on it it is along with the other enforcement actions the biggest priority that we have were doing our work and the fed will determine when the work is done to their satisfaction john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research understood thanks john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thanks john operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hey scott wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys hey thanks for taking it john just was hoping you might be able to update or refresh your thoughts on how and sort of when losses might evolve i guess embedded in that as sort of how are you treating reupped deferral requests things like that and i guess additionally the updated reserves build kind of implies sort of what youre thinking about cumulative losses through the period but just any updated thoughts you can share please john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah well as it relates to deferrals which generally speaking is the consumer side of the house the fact that we are deferring definitely pushes out rolls through delinquency buckets into chargeoff and so the actual charge offs themselves will probably come later than they otherwise would we believe that we fully provided or captured that in the allowance so weve taken the credit charge today that we think is the right one at the end of the quarter even if the chargeoffs come somewhat later were also seeing we saw a tick up in chargeoffs in commercial but there also things do take a little bit before they roll i think i guess i would expect the chargeoff rates and they will be different by asset category to sort of move up slowly through the end of the year even into the first couple quarters and next year and then start to flatten out after that just based on on the way things progress through loss recognition r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then maybe just to switch gears a little the additional customer remediation accruals charlie or john could you go through sort of the i know you alluded to sort of taking a fresh look at things under new management but i guess curious given the charges weve already seen over the past couple of years sort of what drove those additional accruals in the new thinking john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah so as charlie said it was new leadership at the top of the organization in consumer lending and in the center capability that we have running customer remediation i think theyve gone itembyitem and thought about how to be a little bit more expensive a little bit more consumerfriendly many of these things arent crystal clear and youre always making a judgment as to who it applies to how much should apply and over what timeframe and really in an effort as charlie said to speed it up and move it through they were a little bit more expensive in order to accomplish that but its by and large its the same items that weve been talking about for the last couple of years there are always new things that come in and out of that bucket but the bigger dollars relate to the same topics that weve been covering for a while charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co the only thing id emphasize as john said as most of the dollar do relate to those items and theres a lot of value in getting these things behind us its the work its the overhang its what our customers and communities think about us and so were obviously going to do whats right for the financial position of the company but we want to treat people properly and we want to move on and move to the future and so we made decisions around what we were willing to do certainly with that balanced lens wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you very much john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning hey couple of questions so first off charlie just wanted to get a sense as to where we should be thinking about where the expense improvements come from and the reason im asking is i know youre in the middle of business unit reviews youve got new business unit heads in several places typically folks like that are going to want to make investments youre not going to touch the regulatory side so where should we anticipate you have room to start bringing down expenses ahead of regulatory framework changes charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah and i think your point is actually a very important one which is part of the reason why weve been were trying to be very careful about making it clear that we are going forward and actively going to start to take actions to reduce expenses but we dont want to back ourselves into a corner until all of our work is done because of those two things that you mentioned which are very important having said that and the reality is that the work that we have to do the foundational work to build ph of the risk and control infrastructure and ultimately satisfy the work that the regulators would like us to satisfy its clear its distinct it is fairly broad across the company but we know exactly what it is and what resources are protect against that when we look elsewhere in the company and i think i used the words in the prepared remarks it is we just we have spans and layers at the company which are well beyond what ive seen at other places and makes us a very very inefficient company when we just look at the work thats being generated the things that are being done we as a management team believe that we can change the priorities so that were being really clear on what has to get done and stop a bunch of work that has to get done we have duplicative platforms duplicative processes across the company and so as we think about a series of these things they are extremely significant because these things exist just about in every part of the company in addition i just also want to point out that we have stopped any reductions that were going to take place just given the environment and so there is a series of actions that we are ready to take in fact we have a series of employees who have been told that their jobs will ultimately go away but we were going to let some time pass as wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 we got through the initial stages of the covid crisis so we do see a clear path to start making an impact on the expense base and its like an onion the more we do the more clearer the next round will become betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and is that saying that you could start in the second half i know you mentioned that wed see the benefits here in with expenses below but should we anticipate that some of this will start in second half charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co we are clearly going to take the actions in the second half of this year and obviously depending on what the economics of all that is and the accounting of it not quite sure whether youll see it or in next year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it yeah okay thats understandable and then could i just switch gears to a question on mortgage so the question here oh yeah charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co betsy i just want to add one thing which i just think is important which is because i didnt say this in the prepared remarks but ive certainly talked about this inside the company which is we dont look at a quarter like this and just say okay that is what it is losses are higher our margins are narrow we know weve got some work going on and so well eventually get around to it while we knew these things had to get done and the work was getting done its not lost on us our underperformance relative to where we should be earning and so while i think there was a sense of urgency towards both getting the regulatory work done and improving our performance whatever sense of urgency existed before is going to be small relative to what it is going forward betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah yeah i get that charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sorry that i had to interrupt you betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc no i get that and i also im hearing in your commentary that the costs around the regulatory and the risk and those costs is it fair to say are more known today than they were maybe a year ago charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i think absolutely as time goes on and we become we could get much clearer on what has to get done its clearly easier for us to put a broad understanding of what that takes and again just to be clear when we go and part of the reason why it takes us a period of time to do this properly is were going to have very formal wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 processes in place to ensure whatever reductions in our expense base we take that they do not impact any of that work and so thatll be informal and it will be very very formal because that would be just a terrible terrible mistake for everyone if we were not to do that properly so beyond heightened consciousness on that issue betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right just switching to mortgage refi speeds have been incredibly high and through second quarter and john i just wanted to get your sense as to whats in your base case assumptions for i mean part of the reason for asking is it impacts the servicing prepayment speeds it impacts your nii outlook with the refinancing on the agency and then i also just wanted to have a quick followup question here on the ginnie buyouts that you did that the american banker highlighted this morning just understanding is that the first of many or not thanks john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah good question so on mortgage speeds and it shows up in the msr shows up in our investment portfolio and it shows up in the runoff of booked loans that are in our heldforinvestment portfolio in loan form the speed assumptions vary depending on the vintage the coupon the debt to income the ltv et cetera and the refinanceability of borrower by borrower but i think were as aware as anyone of how fast things have gotten and were seeing handle cpr on various pools of loans and so while we think weve captured that in our updated estimates on the msr in particular it does feed into this level of call it million to million per quarter of premium amortization for mortgage securities which as i said is likely to remain for the rest of the year on ginnie buyouts whats happening there is that there are loans that have gone delinquent in part because of covid and as the servicer we essentially have the accounting consequence of owning them whether we buy them out or not theyre deemed because the the option to purchase them is so deeply in the money were deemed to have bought them and so our calculus was either to have a giant pile of cash and that consolidated asset or to go ahead and buy them out and not have that asset essentially that asset twice but use the cash to buy the asset and these are guaranteed loans from our perspective not a huge credit consequence its just carrying the asset for a period of time before it either gets redelivered or sold or worked out in some way so thats why we were a big buyer in the in the actually that was after the end of the quarter and then with respect to whether it continues on if its well facts and circumstances the same tension will apply if were deemed to have them on our books because we have the option to buy them then we may and if cash levels remain where they are then we may go ahead and do it just so we dont really double up the size of our balance sheet and that is an asset cap consideration betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah no it makes a ton of sense but so its a function of in more forbearance from here is that the driver john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co moreongoing thats right and whether were the servicer or not but thats thats right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 yeah yeah of course all right okay thank you john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning good afternoon now at east coast just a followup question on the nii outlook seems like in the second half some pluses or minuses to get to the midzone of your billion billion but just can you help us understand just how much more rollthrough there needs to be from here on both asset yields and securities yields to your earlier points of how youre reinvesting and then what from here can also happen on the deposit cost side as a partial offset john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah so i think on the deposit cost side our anticipation is that between the reduction in pricing for interest bearing deposits and the growth or continuity of noninterestbearing deposits that our average deposit cost is back in the singledigit basis points by the third or fourth quarter thats the trajectory that were on thats where we were in on the asset side depending on what happens to libor probably in particular spreads are holding firm where were lending and there will be some there could be some lower spread loan product that is replaced with higher youve heard about that in autos its true in some categories of ci but thats a piece of it on the securities front weve been trying to stay invested but the level of prepayments that betsy just referred to i think at our securities portfolio down by almost billion in the quarter and so how much more duration we want to add at these low yields is a separate issue we havent been adding much in creditrelated securities product but as i mentioned i think to john the outlook for nim is relatively rangebound through the rest of the year were sort of bumping along what we think the bottom could be i mean obviously things could change but at a zero on the frontend and basis points on the longend this feels about where were likely to be with the things that i mentioned ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right and then so i guess then really just nii growth next year or just youre starting from a high point this year so well probably be in the hole still next year but really does it depend on the asset cap then or does it depend on the mix of earning assets in order to get that kind of off this billionish type of nii number wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah its a good question its both so its what choices we make on the asset side and what the market is offering where loan demand comes from i think will matter a lot the slope of the curve if things get a little steeper that obviously could be helpful because were so exposed at the longend and then if theres an opportunity to have a bigger balance sheet were certainly not budgeting that way or counting on it but that would be a differencemaker ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay one just quick followup john on the servicing side of mortgage great production in the tougher servicing results theres both the core fees that are contracting because of the prepays and then theres all the hedging whats the best way you can help us understand how that mortgage banking line item just trajects from here given especially the uncertainty and how you model out the servicing side john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah its tricky but so i think what weve said is we expect volumes on the production side to be a little bit higher and margins to be relatively constant so if those two things hold true the third quarter should be a relatively great production environment for mortgage and on the servicing side we think weve captured the higher servicing costs for default servicing modification servicing et cetera we now have faster speed expectations in the model although we said that a quarter ago too we were surprised on the downside but if both of those things are captured then we will produce lower servicing fees because the book itself is getting smaller but ill take smaller servicing revenue as long as were not taking big writedowns on the assets that are offsetting the benefit that were generating on the origination side and hopefully the third quarter reflects that ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thanks john john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hey saul saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey guys hello thanks for taking my questions first of all really really specific question related to the four quarter dividend cap can you just verify john that thats based on net income before preferred stock dividends and because i think that the guidance from the fed is public that its based on your y net income figure and wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 for you guys obviously that does matter given the size of the preferred stock dividend so just wanted to make sure that that point is clarified john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah the way were calculating its indiscernible aftertax but before preferred stock dividends which gets you to indiscernible available to common saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it okay so youre calculating before preferred stock dividends just to be clear john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co correct yeah saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it a much much much broader question and kudos on the donation to cdfis that i think a lot of them do a lot of very good work and i guess on that point though i do think that its pretty clear that wells does have to maybe more than others really focus on multiple stakeholders and different goals and the idea of strictly shareholderdriven capital is obviously already under attack and you have to make your regulators meet their demands employees i think you genuinely are concerned about the wellbeing of the communities you work in and then you have guys like me who talk about your roces and your super high efficiency ratios how youre going to rightsize your cost structures and i guess how do you think about that that the balancing act of those competing demands i think in the past most management teams have argued that they can do all of those things simultaneously and i think to a certain degree maybe that is true but there are some tradeoffs and some element of a zerosum dynamic going on so i guess charlie im curious maybe just more philosophically how you think about that and i guess ultimately how do you think about shareholder value in that totem pole of goals charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i guess i dont think about it as a tradeoff and i dont think about it as something which is different for us versus other significant companies whether youre a financial institution or not i think it is very very clear that our ability to be successful as a company for our shareholders includes the fact that we are broadly considering a much broader set of stakeholders if we dont do that customers whether theyre consumers or companies ultimately wont want to be supportive of us well have issues in our local communities itll filter through to the legislative and likely the regulatory agenda so i think we very much think that they are very much related and that theres no reason why the things that we should be doing to be more thoughtful of a broader set of stakeholders they arent a set of financial negatives ultimately it should be something beyond that the ppp fees were certainly something that was very unique were in the middle of this really horrific time for small businesses and especially minorityowned small businesses the right thing for us as a significant company in this country is to be as helpful as we can with that community its also ultimately helpful for us if we can make a difference in the communities that we operate and then we also looked at that relative to just what we thought was fair for us in order to participate in the ppp program and so i think you put all those things together and there is alignment and those that dont think about it that way will likely suffer over the longterm wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc all right thanks for the thoughtful answer appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good afternoon so i wanted to start off charlie with just a theoretical question on the asset cap you talked about the proactive steps that were taken to manage the balance sheet to stay below and how thats negatively impacted nii since most investors are focusing at this juncture on normalized nii and throughthecycle revenue growth expectations if the fed were to lift the asset cap tomorrow i was hoping you could give us some idea or context around the amount of pentup growth potential in the balance sheet today just i think it would be helpful if you could frame the impact of the asset cap on nii or at least volume growth based on where things stand today john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co so this is john if just as a data point using rough math if our balance sheet was expanded by call it billion or about during this covid timeframe and theres a question about whether there was ample opportunity to do that around several asset classes but in certain areas it certainly was it was something like our average nim the impact that that would have had on us would have been and this is easier approximations but to reduce the draw down on nii by so half of how things have worsened would have been covered by that expansion of the balance sheet thats one way to think about it there were more immediate opportunities to put loans on in particular i would say in march as capital markets were closed i think everybody knows that and we saw customers drawing on available facilities and other requests for new facilities the bigger probably more constant piece of an increased balance sheet at least in the businesses that we serve today would probably be to have a bigger securities and securities financing portfolio in support of our corporate and investment bank where we have drawn down as part of managing under the asset cap and theres a handful of benefits to that including being able to do more business with the companies that were and the institutions that were financing in that realm but you also end up with a big liborfunded book that is a little bit less asymmetric in a downrate scenario and we certainly suffered from that theres a real benefit to being substantially deposit funded in that its very lowcost to begin with but in a downrate environment its a little bit more violent in terms of the outcome that it generates and to have a bigger component piece of liborfunded assets of liborfunded liabilities its a little bit less high producing in the best of times but it maintains its margin in a downrate environment so that would have been a benefit also i dont know charlie may have other thoughts charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i think thats indiscernible steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 okay no thats helpful color john so thanks for that just had one more question this one i guess ive asked over the last couple of quarters but wanted to get some context around the core fee income level or the jumping off point which you think about for the back half you cited some of the tailwinds from mortgage production trust fee should benefit from the higher markets but you also have some normalization of trading activity and just given all the different moving pieces i was hoping you could give us some sense as to what the right jumping off point might be for john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah we dont put a number on it and call it core but rather talk about the component pieces of it and so service charges on deposits which is a big one for us my assumption is that its going to feel at least for a while like it does today people are spending differently they are maintaining cash balances at a higher level and so there are whether its waivers because of high balances or the absence of overdraft that puts pressure on that line item as our customers do whats right for them in this environment you mentioned brokerage advisory et cetera that should be stronger going into the second half of the year investment banking we had a record high grade market in the first quarter so while other activity may pick up a little bit my sense is that that probably normalizes somewhat card fees have reflected i mentioned in my prepared remarks which is at least in the debit card space weve got balances or flows in dollar terms about equal to last year but the number of transaction is lower which has a negative impact in card fees and credit card fees have been improving but havent caught up so i dont think its going to pop back up anytime really quickly mortgage i mentioned on the production side should be very strong or should be strong and hopefully weve accounted for faster speeds and higher costs in servicing trading as you said probably gets a little bit softer and other items are less material and theres nothing really noteworthy so thats how i think about the categories steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc well you covered the gamut thanks so much for that john charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co you bet john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hi matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 hi i want to circle back on kind of the longerterm view of getting your efficiency closer to peers and i guess the first question is why do you necessarily think its an expense issue versus a revenue issue or is it a combination of both john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co its definitely a combination of both revenue particularly interest income which doesnt carry a lot of expense load would be very helpful i think what were trying to do is assess where the company is today and what we can do about it and we can do more about expense than we can about revenue in a balance sheet constrained environment in a recession and in a lowrate environment so its actionable by the management team but without a doubt some amount of normalization of certain categories of revenue would contribute to it but having said that i think weve sort of vectored in in a variety of different ways on the idea that all things being equal and im sure they wont be but at least as we think about it today that billion is a reasonable amount to go after to put wells fargo on a level playing field with the largecap peers charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and the only thing i would add to what john said is this isnt the calculation of the billion thats a mathematical exercise when the management team the operating committee gets in a room there is absolutely no disagreement in the room not about the math but about the inefficiencies that exist inside the company away from all of these riskrelated activities and the work that weve been doing is to build the plans from the bottomup to identify where that is and so whether thats the full billion or not well see what we get to but there is we certainly have a clear belief that we can make a significant dent based upon what we know matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and just to be clear what you think kind of the longerterm cost base can be when you use the billion as kind of a reference point should we just annualize this quarters costs that gets you about billion you take out billion gets you around billion i mean is that the thought process john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i think billionish is more of the normalized starting point without the excess expenses that are loaded into this quarter for the items that we mentioned matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so take billion off the billion john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 okay and i guess just related to that like whenever i think about kind of cost saves like there are areas that youll want to invest in there is just natural inflation creep so i mean you guys kind of opened up a little bit of the can of worms on the billion so i know these are things that are tough to predict like looking out a few years but charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co but we didnt open a can of worms because i dont look at it like we opened a can of worms i think we look at it like were acknowledging what the facts are which is the facts are as we compete with other companies that are investing tremendously and with those set of investments the math says the following and so what we we again purposely havent said were going to reduce our expenses by a certain point in time because we are doing the work to figure out what the timing looks like with our reductions versus our investments but i think whats important is not just that we acknowledge that that gap exists but we are proactively working to get to a place which makes sense both from an efficiency standpoint knowing that we should be investing in the business matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay all right and it sounds like well get some more details in the third quarter or so i think we all look forward to that john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thanks charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thanks matt operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi hi good morning john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the credit side just want to see if i could get your updated thoughts around your throughcycle loss estimates that you would expect i know your company run dfast is about billion is that a fair way to think about it and then also want to get your thoughts around the reserve you took a pretty good addition this quarter and now your reserve is about of that dfast do you think theres likelihood for additional substantial reserve additions from here thanks wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thanks thanks for the question so we do the math to compare our own estimations to the dfast outcomes but we dont think of them as necessarily better informed about our loans and our portfolios and our risk profile and our collection activity et cetera so thats its a useful data point and its an external one that people can judge against but we think more about our own experience and the scenarios that we believe are the likely ones in the world that were living in and so thats how we focused it with the build that we made in the allowance i think were at almost coverage of the outstanding loan portfolio and of course its very different by loan category like it is for every other bank i think we believe that if the world unfolds in the way that weve got it modeled and assumed in our both modeled loss estimations and in our bottomsup portfolio by portfolio work that we will have captured the loss content in the portfolio as of the end of the quarter and as a result unless things really indiscernible in a worse direction that this would be this would have accounted for those losses john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks john and then related to that on the commercial real estate side just want to see if you could discuss the credit trends that youre seeing in commercial real estate i know that delinquencies in cmbs structures really spiked for the industry beyond even financial crisis levels and but clearly that is being staved off somewhat at the banks by forbearance efforts are you could you just give us a little bit of that granularity around what youre seeing and the level of forbearance in commercial real estate and is it seeing greater pressure in the portfolio to forbear given the pressure that your borrowers are seeing thanks john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah the first distinguishing point id make is that and i know you know this but for everybodys benefit the cmbs structures are nonrecourse loans and so theres no alternative other than realizing on the collateral theres no mechanism for extra cash flow to enter into a structure unless somebody does something that theyre not contractually obligated to do to try and shore things up and i think as ive seen most recently the june numbers in cmbs are about of loans are not current conversely on a banks balance sheet most of the loans that we have have real sponsorship and recourse and generally speaking are lower ltv than cmbs to begin with so our actual performance is quite different and then i think we talked about this last quarter too but the variation in how deep well go from an ltv perspective is as youd hope with the more stable property types we might have higher leverage and with the least stable property types wed have lower leverage which helps a lot in a downdraft so we have in round numbers roughly billion worth of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the quarter the biggest piece is a quarter of that is office of that is apartments is industrial is retail excluding shopping centers and then is shopping centers and everything else is below actually hotels is about which is a volatile property type and then among nonaccrual loans the shopping centers are hotels and retail excluding shopping centers is another and everything else is below and theres about billion of nonaccruals overall so thats what it feels like were working through these things borrower by borrower sometimes the concessions that were making are just covenant related sometimes they are real forbearance and we allow wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 people to take a little bit more time to pay our borrowers who have been generally calm and constructive its not a lot of panic at this point in the cycle the problem loans have skewed towards retail projects many of which were already struggling and then also the hotel owners with lower capitalization so i hope thats helpful john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it no that is helpful so really youre reserving within community real estate or youd say that that represents the similar stance for your overall portfolio in other words youre pretty much finished building reserves there as well john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co for how we understand the world at the end of the second quarter yes and we think thats relatively we think its very realistic i should also add that in commercial real estate and elsewhere our teams have gone loan by loan borrower by borrower and made an assessment of where we think we are and where we think things are going so its not just a modeled set of expectations but real careful review of every borrower every property and their circumstances john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks john john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah operator your next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hi brian brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi thanks guys one quick question thats more of a clarification you did mention that on slide that of nonaccruals were current on interest and principal was that referring to the billion increase or was that referring to the total and i guess why nonaccrual if theyre current on interest and principal john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co total the total amount brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 okay and then separately when you think about the dfast results and youre saying that you may perform better than those results i guess where do you take exception with kind of how the feds modeling your stress losses versus how you see them coming through this cycle john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah forgive me if i dont start the response by saying we take exception with the feds results in the following way because thats not really that wont be helpful but they draw from different models and have different approaches and we draw from our own as i said bottomsup our own modeled outcomes our own historical outcomes changing the composition of the portfolio changing underwriting standards since whatever were comparing it to and we end up with the numbers that we end up with im happy to note that i think in general the fed applies in general a lower loss rate for a variety of loan categories to wells fargo than they have for some other lenders its not universally true based on the composition of portfolios but we like our numbers were a lot of work with a lot of very close inside knowledge of borrowers properties et cetera goes into it and its being compared with something thats more statistically driven from a model that we dont have access to brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of chris kotowski with oppenheimer company chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc yeah good morning john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hi chris chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc two quick things one just to hi to follow up on matts question i mean just from to today i mean your revenue run rate went from billion to roughly 70ish billion and your core operating expenses have kind of stayed flattish at 54ish billion lets say it so i mean sitting here on the outside it would look like its primarily a revenue problem not an expense problem and i mean when you put out a number like billion are you worried that that is going to like forego the optionality on capturing back that billion in lost revenues or should we assume that thats kind of gone charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i think you should go back and listen to the words that we used to describe what the billion is and how were thinking about this listen theres no question in our minds that we should have the ability to generate higher revenues in the future no question that will help when it comes to an efficiency ratio what were talking about is wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 if you go back and look at where we were as a company versus the others the others the big companies that we compete with have been working on this for to years and there is and again were being very factual about this which you should go back and check yourself which is there is this meaningful difference between what our expense base looks like and theirs and then i recognize youre on the outside but what were telling you is on the inside that we as a management team continue to believe that the opportunities are substantial to improve the efficiency of the organization because we see it day in and day out and were going through a process to identify exactly what it is where it is its not just people its the thirdparty spend here is extraordinary the things that we rely on outside people to do is beyond anything that ive ever seen our ability to reduce facilities is substantial and so theres this long list of things that we will actively be working on whether that gets to billion whether it gets to more whether it gets to less well see were going to share more as we develop the plans but i think its just important for us as a management team to be very objective at what things looked like for this company before we wound up in todays environment and those efficiencies clearly exist in the company chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay and then just a small thing i thought i heard john say that youre no longer accepting home equity and personal line of credit applications and i mean i realize that those have been declining categories and that they are not the kind of product lines today that they were before the great financial crisis and all that but still arent those kind of sort of key products in a big consumer banks arsenal and doesnt it send a wrong message to not even take the applications charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well i guess let me ill talk about a piece john can talk about a piece the way id think about it is first of all we do offer personal lines in the company because we have a credit card business and so for us its a question of making sure that weve got the right product in front of the customer and so we think we have the ability to do that the home equity product as you rightfully mentioned has certainly declined in terms of the amount of production that was taking place but we do have to make a determination in the uncertain environment as to what is a smart thing for us to participate in along with consumers as they add risk to their balance sheet as time goes on if we feel differently about the environment and about real estate values those decisions could change as well chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay fair enough thank you operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi charlie hi john a couple of questions thanks for taking them firstly charlie are you still on track to be giving us some kind of strategic review or strategic plan towards the end of the year or should we expect that with the cost details that youre going to give us in the third quarter how are you thinking in terms of timing of the two things wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hi i think as we between the third and fourth quarter were looking at getting both done to share the complete our complete set of thoughts with you vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so youll give them youll give it to us simultaneously so that we can see how the two fit together charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co again i think thats what were targeting but well have to see how it plays out and our work progresses vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay in that same vein charlie as youre thinking about all of this you talk about having too much of an expense dollar relative to your peers how much of this where you find businesses where its because you just dont have enough scale on the revenue side are you thinking youre going to exit some of those businesses what are you thinking there are you thinking about more business exits any thoughts on that charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah thats a good question vivek and i think weve talked about this a little bit over the last couple of quarters there absolutely are some things that we do which either we dont have scale in or it just might not be big enough to have an impact on the company going forward and its not clear that its integral to us being able to fulfill the primary banking relationships that we have from the consumer to the small business and middlemarket up to the corporate so i think as we think about what the company should look like we absolutely are looking at those things and so we certainly expect that we would continue to i think john has used the word prune some of these things that exist inside the company as weve been doing i dont think about them in terms of to say it differently the five lines of business that weve determined we do believe are key to the future of the company but when you go below that theres certainly some activities which might not meet our criteria for continuing to be here vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then when you give us these combined reviews will you give us some sense of weve been weve heard about need to spend more on technology areas that youre behind in will you give us some sense also where that stands business by business and what you need to do and how that sort of dovetails with the numbers too charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co listen well see when we get closer to the level of detail that we go through with you but certainly the work that were doing contemplates the fact that we dont want to stand still in our businesses wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of charles peabody with portales charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc good afternoon and thank you two questions one and i apologize if youve already covered this but i transitioned over late from the citigroup call what were the variables that went into your thinking on the level of the dividend i mean was it this was a level that you didnt have to worry about it again was it a function of what you think your core earnings power is going forward or is it desire to build capital what were the variables that got you to that level john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co a handful of things of course and with the expectation that its likely that the right constraints on the calculation of allowable dividend hang around for a while even though they may not but they certainly may we found a level that we believe is something that gives us more of an upside ability as the covid environment clears up as the mediumterm earnings power of the company becomes more known both in terms of sources of revenue and whats happening with expense et cetera so that we wouldnt end up or have a low likelihood of ending up in an environment where youre making repeated changes to the dividend so not so much about our capital levels are fine we have 23ishbillion of excess on top of our regulatory capital requirement and we feel its gone up as you may have observed and thats even after building a billion allowance so not so much capital sufficiency although in the future it could turn out differently than we and others are planning right now but really more about thinking about the core earnings power and a resulting upward trajectory when the time is right charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and so i would just add i know we certainly appreciate the multiple calls that are going on today and its a busy day for you all id encourage you to go back and look at the prepared remarks because we did walk through the thinking charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc okay thank you and as a followup question theres a june letter from or congressmen on both sides of the aisle so bipartisan and its addressed to mnuchin and powell and in this letter they warn of the looming crisis in the cre and particularly the cmbs market and they ask for help from the treasury and the fed i was curious what actions you think they might be thinking about taking to support the cmbs market or what actions would you like to see them to take charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i dont know that we have an opinion on what actions wed like to see them take i do think that as between the risk owners and cmbs transactions and servicers and borrowers people should be looking to maximize recovery value but the contracts are pretty thoughtful this isnt the first downturn that those market participants have been wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 through and my expectation is that a lot of decisionmaking power is going to end up in the hands of special servicers and i dont know how to i dont know why it would be a good idea to impose some other regime on top of that that changes those contracts but i dont have a careful thoughtful review of whats being proposed charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc thank you operator our final question will come from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hello gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi john i apologize if you touched on this already but when you guys gave us in slide or im sorry slide the number of customers youve helped with deferring payments and waiving fees can you give us some color on the trend in terms of the applications for these deferrals i assume they were very heavy early on and theyve faded downwards and then second how many of the customers that have come up for renewal have actually asked for a second extension for the deferrals john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well its different by loan category and yes its true that the people additionally asking theres sort of a high point we peaked our peak was the second week in april i think on average we had about to accounts per day who were asking we dropped almost entirely i think were at a day for the week of late june so if thats helpful and of course the extension question is related to how long was the initial deferral to begin with and in general i would say that more people are getting comfortable with coming out the other side but yet we still have a good base of folks who are in deferral gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then second john have you guys gotten any color from the fed on how long theyre going to be supportive of the industry yourselves included in granting these deferrals without having to reclassify the loans and put more capital against them john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i dont think weve got a specific conclusion on that although we do assume that theres going to be some point in time after which whether its the regulators not only the fed andor our accounting convention is going to cause wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2020 us to have to consider these as something other than a performing loan it might be different by category it might be different by regulator but the longer we go on the greater the risk of that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great lastly thank you again for the great detail that you guys give in your commercial and industrial loan portfolio and i noticed as you mentioned the increase in nonaccruals on page the different categories can you give us some color on the real estate and construction the nonaccruals went to million up from i guess it was million in the prior quarter how much was construction versus loans to the nondepository financials john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i dont think i have the breakout in front of me but i can have the ir team followup with you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great no i appreciate it john thank you john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co you bet john m campbell directorinvestor relations wells fargo co all right guys well listen thank you very much for the time we appreciate it and we will talk to you soon take care operator ladies and
