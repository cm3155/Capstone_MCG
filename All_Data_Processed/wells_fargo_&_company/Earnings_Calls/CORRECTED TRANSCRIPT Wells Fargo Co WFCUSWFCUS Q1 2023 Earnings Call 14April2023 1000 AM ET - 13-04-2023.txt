comments about our first quarter results and update you on our priorities ill then turn the call over to mike to review first quarter results in more detail before we take your questions let me start with some first quarter highlights our results in the quarter were strong and reflected the continued progress were making to improve returns we grew revenue from both the fourth quarter and a year ago we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives and expenses declined for both the fourth quarter and a year ago driven by lower operating losses but we continue to be focused on controlling other expenses as well the consumer and majority of our businesses remain strong delinquencies and net chargeoffs have continued to slowly increase as expected were looking for signs of accelerated deterioration in asset classes or segments of our customers and broadly speaking we saw little change in the trends from the prior quarter however weakness continues to develop in commercial real estate office and mike will discuss this in more detail given what were seeing were taking incremental actions to tighten credit on higherrisk segments but continue to lend broadly we increased our allowance for credit losses for the fourth consecutive quarter our economic expectations used to support the allowance have not changed meaningfully but we do continue to look at specific asset classes such as commercial real estate to appropriately assess the adequacy of the allowance we will continue to monitor the trends in each of our loan portfolios to determine if future action is warranted wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 both commercial and consumer average loans were up from a year ago but were relatively stable from the fourth quarter consumer spending remains strong with growth in both debit and credit card spend but spending began to soften late in the quarter the decline in average deposits that started a year ago continued in the first quarter primarily driven by customers seeking higheryielding alternatives and continued growth in consumer spending we did see some moderate inflows from the few specific banks that have been highlighted in the press but those inflows have abated our cet1 ratio which was already strong increased to even as we resumed common stock repurchases in the first quarter buying back billion in common stock let me share some thoughts on the recent market events impacting the banking industry were glad that the work we have completed over the last several years has put us in a position to help support the us financial system along with other large banks we utilized our strength and liquidity and we made a billion uninsured deposit into first republic bank reflecting our confidence in the countrys banking system and to help provide first republic with liquidity to continue serving its customers im proud of everything our employees have done during this historic period to be there for our customers we believe banks of all sizes are an important part of our financial system as each is uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities its important to recognize that banks have different operating models and that the banks that failed in the first quarter were quite different from what people think of when they think about the typical regional bank these particular banks had concentrated business models with heavy reliance on uninsured deposits our franchise and those of many other banks operate with a broader business model and more diversified funding sources it is times like these that the many benefits of our own franchise become even more clear our diversified business model provides opportunities to serve our customers broadly which reduces concentration risk across the different elements of risk most importantly our customers benefit from our size and the range of banking services we provide which helps us build a full relationship with individuals and companies we also have strong capital and liquidity positions which include a mix of deposits and access to multiple funding sources and our continued focus on financial and credit risk management allows us to support our customers throughout economic cycles now let me update you on the progress weve made on our strategic priorities our top priority remains building out our risk and control framework appropriate for our company i spent time in my recent annual letter highlighting why we remain confident in our ability to complete this work including having much more effective reporting and processes in place to provide appropriate oversight adding close to people across numerous risk and controlrelated groups as part of our commitment to make the investments needed to complete the work and building the management disciplines and culture to govern and execute the work which includes the operating committee reviewing risks and regulatory progress and escalations on a weekly basis i also summarized the actions weve taken to simplify the way we operate this work continued in the first quarter as we largely completed the exit of the correspondent home lending business as part of our plans to simplify that business were also narrowing our retail mortgage business to focus on predominantly bank customers and underserved communities our strategy includes broadening our existing investment from the special purpose credit program to include purchased loans investing an additional million to advance racial equity in home ownership and deploying additional home mortgage consultants in local minority communities we continue to transform the way we serve our customers by offering innovative products and solutions we announced a multiyear agreement with choice hotels to launch a new cobranded credit card this month creating a bestinclass credit card program designed to enhance our customers experience and bring them more value we rolled out early pay day late last year which makes eligible direct deposits available up to two days wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 early in the first quarter this enhancement provided customers early access to over billion in direct deposits we launched flex loan in the fourth quarter a digitalonly smalldollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access to funds customer response continues to exceed our expectations and weve originated over loans since november digital adoption and usage among our consumer customers continue to increase we added over mobile active customers in the first quarter and digital logins increased from a year ago since rolling out vantage our new enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients late last year weve received overwhelmingly positive feedback on the new user experience vantage uses ai and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients specific needs we also continued to make progress on our environmental social and governance work we announced a million grant to the naacp to support efforts to advance racial equity in america this is the single largest donation the naacp has ever received from a corporation and builds on our longstanding relationship with the naacp that spans more than years the wells fargo foundation expanded its commitment to housing affordability through another million housing affordability breakthrough challenge to advance ideas to help meet the need for more affordable homes across the country we also announced a million commitment to advance economic opportunities in native american communities including addressing housing small business financial health and sustainability before concluding i wanted to highlight the management changes we announced yesterday mary mack the ceo of consumer small business banking is retiring this summer she spent her entire career at wells fargo and has led consumer small business banking for the past seven years through a significant amount of change including defining a new path forward for the business i can think of few wells fargo colleagues who have done as much for our company and have been as visible in the communities that we serve over such a long period of time we also announced that saul van beurden head of technology at wells fargo will succeed mary saul is a strong leader a technologist and he knows how to run a business this makes him the ideal person to lead consumer small business banking into the future our branch network will continue to be the key to business but our customers expect us to provide them with increasingly digitized and seamless banking experiences across all channels saul understands this deeply and has consistently proven his ability to convert new products and services across wells fargo finally tracy kerrins currently head of consumer technology will become head of technology for the company reporting to me tracy has worked in the technology and finance industry for more than years and has led a series of businesscritical initiatives to modernize our technology platforms across our consumer businesses shes a strong resultsdriven leader its always great when we can tap our own leaders for roles within the company and i want to thank mary for everything shes done during her tenure at wells fargo its truly been a pleasure working with her as we look forward were carefully watching customer behavior for clues on how the economic environment is changing customer activity is still relatively strong and delinquencies remain low though they are increasing there are pockets of risks such as commercial office real estate which will likely impact institutions differently and were proactively managing our own exposures we continue to expect economic growth to slow and we are prepared for a range of scenarios we will continue to monitor both the markets and our customers and we will react accordingly our diversified business model should enable us to support our customers throughout economic cycles wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 ill now turn the call over to mike michael p santomassimo senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thank you charlie and good morning everyone net income for the first quarter was billion or per diluted common share while there was a lot going on in the banking industry around us we continued to focus on our priorities and our results reflected the progress were making which ill highlight throughout the call starting with capital and liquidity on slide our cet1 ratio is up approximately basis points from the fourth quarter reflecting our earnings in the quarter and lower riskweighted assets after pausing share repurchases for the prior three quarters we repurchased billion of common stock in the first quarter our cet1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers and we expect to continue to prudently return excess capital to shareholders in the coming quarters in the first quarter our liquidity coverage ratio is approximately percentage points above the regulatory minimum we continue to benefit from a diversified deposit base with over of our deposits in our consumer banking and lending segment as of the first quarter which is a higher percentage than before the pandemic turning to credit quality on slide net loan chargeoffs continued to slowly increase to basis points in the first quarter but were still below prepandemic levels commercial net loan chargeoffs decreased million from the fourth quarter to basis points however while losses improved we continue to see some gradual weakening in underlying credit performance including higher nonperforming assets we are proactively monitoring our clients sensitivity to inflation and higher rates and are taking appropriate actions when warranted we are also closely monitoring our commercial real estate office portfolio and ill share some more details on our exposure on the next slide as expected weve seen consumer delinquencies and losses gradually increase total consumer net loan chargeoffs increased million in the fourth quarter to basis points of average loans driven by an increase in the credit card portfolio while most consumers remain resilient weve seen some consumer financial health trends gradually weakening from a year ago and weve continued to take credit tightening actions to position the portfolio for a slowing economy nonperforming assets increased from the fourth quarter driven by higher commercial real estate non accrual loans but were down from a year ago due to lower residential mortgage nonaccrual loans of note of the nonaccrual loans in our commercial real estate portfolio were current on interest and were current on both principal and interest as of the end of the first quarter our allowance for credit losses increased million in the first quarter reflecting an increase for commercial real estate loans primarily office loans as well as an increase for credit card and auto loans given the increased focus on commercial real estate loans especially office we provided more details in our portfolio on slide we had billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter with billion of office loans which represented of our total loans outstanding the office market continues to show signs of weakness due to lower demand higher financing costs and challenging capital market conditions while we havent seen this translate to meaningful loss content yet we expect to see more stress over time as you would expect we have been derisking the office portfolio which resulted in commitments declining from a year ago and we continue to proactively work with borrowers to manage our exposure including structural enhancements and paydowns as warranted wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 as you can see on the slide weve provided some additional data on the office portfolio including approximately is owneroccupied therefore the loan performance is mostly tied to the cash flow of the owners operating business rather than rents paid by tenants nearly onethird had recourse to a guarantor typically through a repayment guarantee the portfolio is geographically diverse and as youd expect the largest concentrations are in california and new york over twothirds of our office loans are in the corporate and investment banking business and the vast majority of this portfolio is institutional quality real estate with highcaliber sponsors while approximately of its class a keep in mind that this is a single measure that is hard to evaluate in isolation for example newer or refurbished properties may perform better regardless of whether they are class a or b we are providing this data to give you more insight into the portfolio but as is usually the case in commercial real estate each property situation is different and a myriad of other variables such as leasing rates loan to value and debt yields can determine performance which is why we regularly review the portfolio on a loanbyloan basis as a result of market conditions and recent increases in criticized assets and nonaccrual loans weve increased our allowance for credit losses for office loans for the past four quarters the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio at the end of the first quarter for the office portfolio in the corporate investment bank was we will continue to closely monitor this portfolio but as has been the case in prior cycles this will likely play out over an extended period of time as we actively work with borrowers to help resolve issues they may be facing on slide we highlight loans and deposits average loans grew from a year ago and were relatively stable from the fourth quarter while periodend loans declined from the fourth quarter with lower balances across our consumer and commercial portfolios ill highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results average loan yields increased basis points from a year ago and basis points from the fourth quarter reflecting a higher interest rate environment average deposits declined from a year ago and from the fourth quarter due to the consumer deposit outflows as customers continued to reallocate cash in higher yielding alternatives and continued spending during the market stress last month we experienced a brief increase in deposit inflows that has since abated and while our periodend deposit balances were slightly higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter theyre still down from the fourth quarter as expected our average deposit cost increased basis points from the fourth quarter to basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates our mix of noninterestbearing deposits declined from in the fourth quarter to in the first quarter but remained above prepandemic levels turning to net interest income on slide first quarter net interest income was billion which was higher than a year ago as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates the million decline from the fourth quarter was due to two fewer business days our full year net interest income guidance has not changed from last quarter as we still expect net interest income to grow by approximately compared with ultimately the amount of net interest income we earn this year will depend on a variety of factors many of which are uncertain including the absolute level of interest rates the shape of the yield curve deposit balances mix and repricing and loan demand turning to expenses on slide noninterest expense declined from a year ago driven by lower operating losses and the impact of efficiency initiatives the increase in personnel expense from the fourth quarter was driven by approximately million of seasonally higher expenses in the first quarter including payroll taxes restricted stock expense for retirementeligible employees and 401k matching contributions our full year noninterest expense excluding operating losses is still expected to be approximately billion unchanged wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 from the guidance we provided last quarter as a reminder we have outstanding litigation regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses turning to our operating segments starting with consumer banking and lending on slide consumer small business banking revenue increased from a year ago as higher net interest income driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower depositrelated fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year we are continuing to make investments in this business were beginning to increase marketing spend were accelerating the efforts to renovate and refurbish our branches for our bankers were investing in new tools and capabilities to provide better and more personalized advice to customers were continuing to enhance our mobile app and mobile active users are up yearoveryear and were also seeing increased activity and positive initial indicators after our rollout of wells fargo premier last year its early on for all of these initiatives but we are starting to see some green shoots at the same time we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives teller transactions continued to decline with reduced head count we reduced head count by and total branches were down from a year ago in home lending mortgage rates remained elevated and the mortgage market continue to decline our home lending revenue declined from a year ago driven by lower mortgage originations including a significant decline from the correspondent channel and lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools we continue to reduce head count in the first quarter and we expect staffing levels will continue to decline due to the strategic changes we announced earlier this year we stopped accepting applications from the correspondent channel as announced in january and began to reduce the complexity and the size of the servicing book during the first quarter we successfully marketed mortgage servicing rights for approximately billion of loans serviced for others that we expect to close later this year we will continue to look for additional opportunities to simplify and reduce the size of our servicing business credit card revenue increased from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by higher point ofsale volume auto revenue declined from a year ago driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression from credit tightening actions and continued price competition due to rising interest rates personal lending revenue was up from a year ago due to higher loan balances turning to some key business drivers on slide mortgage originations declined from a year ago and from the fourth quarter with declines in both correspondent and retail originations as i mentioned we stopped accepting correspondent applications in january so going forward our originations will be focused on serving wells fargo customers and underserved communities the size of our auto portfolio has declined for four consecutive quarters and the balances were down ph at the end of the first quarter compared to a year ago origination volume declined from a year ago reflecting credit tightening actions and continued price competition debit card spending increased in the first quarter compared to a year ago and increased from a yearover year growth in the fourth quarter discretionary spending drove the growth with nondiscretionary spending stable from the fourth quarter levels credit card spending increased from a year ago in line with the yearover year growth in the fourth quarter with sustained growth in both discretionary and nondiscretionary spending spending growth slowed throughout the quarter but were still at doubledigit levels in march we continue to see some slight moderation in payment rates in the first quarter but they were still well above prepandemic levels turning to commercial banking results on slide middle market banking revenue grew by from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances while depositrelated fees were lower reflecting higher earnings credit rates on noninterestbearing deposits assetbased lending and leasing wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 revenue increased yearoveryear driven by loan growth which was partially offset by lower net gains from equity securities average loan balances were up in the first quarter compared to a year ago driven by new customer growth and higher line utilization after being stable in the second half of last year line utilization increased slightly in the first quarter average loan balances have grown for seven consecutive quarters and were up from the fourth quarter with the growth in assetbased lending and leasing driven by continued growth in client inventory growth in middle market banking was once again driven by larger clients including both new and existing relationships which more than offset declines from our smaller clients turning to corporate and investment banking on slide banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results reflecting the impact of higher interest rates investment banking fees declined from a year ago reflecting lower market activity with declines across all major products in nearly all industries while commercial real estate market transactions are down across the industry our commercial real estate revenue grew from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances markets revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher trading results across all asset classes average loans grew from a year ago but were down from the fourth quarter lower balances in banking reflected a combination of slow demand increased payoffs and relatively stable line utilization declining commercial real estate balances were driven by the higher rate environment and lower commercial real estate sales volumes on slide wealth and investment management revenue was down compared to a year ago driven by lower assetbased fees due to lower market valuations growth in net interest income was driven by the impact of higher rates which was partially offset by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higheryielding alternatives at the end of the first quarter cash alternatives were approximately of total client assets up from approximately a year ago expenses decreased from a year ago driven by lower revenue related compensation and the impact of efficiency initiatives average loans were down from a year ago primarily due to a decline in securitiesbased lending slide highlights our corporate results revenue declined million or from a year ago as higher net interest income was more than offset by lower results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses results in the first quarter included million of net losses on equity securities or million pre tax and net of noncontrolling interests in summary our results in the first quarter reflect an improvement in our earnings capacity we grew revenue and reduced expenses and had strong growth in pretax preprovision profit as expected our net chargeoffs have continued to slowly increase from historical lows and we are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit tightening actions where appropriate our capital levels grew even as we resume common stock repurchases and we expect repurchases to continue and the guidance we provided last quarter for full year net interest income expenses excluding operating losses has not changed we will now take your questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question for today will come from scott siefers of piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone hey thank you for taking the question mike was hoping to just start out on the deposit side so when you talked about the influx of deposits from some of the sort of special situations having abated did that money actually leave the bank or is it just sort of the inflows that have stopped michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah hey scott thanks for the question look the inflows stopped right and they came in in a pretty short period of time and those inflows stopped and i think what youre seeing since then is just normal spending on the consumer side and normal activity across the other businesses r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then i guess maybe switch gears just a bit i think in your prepared remarks you had discussed plans to sort of prudently return excess capital in coming quarters was very glad to see the resumption in repurchase in the first quarter but just given all the kind of crosscurrents that weve got whether its uncertainty on the regulatory environment or uncertainty on the economy kind of countered against your very strong capital levels just curious for maybe a little more color on how you would be thinking about share repurchase through the remainder of the year charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah this is charlie let me take a stab i would say listen i think the way we feel about it is our capital levels grew quarteroverquarter even after we purchased the billion of stock so it just shows our ability to generate capital if necessary because of the environment or regulatory changes or things like that so because of that we do feel like we have the ability to continue to return capital to shareholders while we still have plenty of flexibility to deal with anything which could come our way and so our excess above the regulatory minimums plus buffers is extremely high beyond what we feel that it needs to be so we think we can continue to address that and still be very prudent with how we manage capital r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co wonderful okay i have a bunch more questions but i have a feeling theyll be asked going forward as well so charlie and mike thank you guys very much really appreciate it operator the next question comes from steven chubak of wolfe research your line is open sir wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning so wanted to get a little bit more granular on some of the expense trends that were seeing weve gone through the exercise of benchmarking your segment efficiency ratios versus peers clearly youve made significant strides improving profitability across virtually every segment commercial cib and wealth the ppnr margins are running really in line with the peer group its still the consumer efficiency ratio in the mid which is running well above peers and i was hoping you could just speak to the opportunity on the expense side within consumer how much of a benefit should you see from the retrenchment in mortgage and maybe what do you see as a normalized efficiency target for the segment just given your current mix of business michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hey steve its mike ill start and charlie can chime in if he wants i think when you think about consumer i think we still have a lot more work to do there and its both in the consumer lending space or the mortgage space as we simplify the servicing side of that business and that just takes a little bit of time to work its way through it needs to be thoughtful and in some cases requires a little bit of investment in technology and the like and then on the consumer banking side weve continued to rationalize the branch footprint and branch setup we continue to see teller transactions and other things decline and so i think youll see us focus there and hopefully what youve seen in that segment is a consistent quarteronquarter decline in head count and other factors and that will sort of continue to hopefully be the case and then when you think about just where the end state is we shouldnt look any different than our peers our bestinclass peers for each of our segments including that one so over a period of time thats the goal charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and i would just add when you look at that segment obviously mix versus other people is an issue our home lending business is today extremely inefficient which is part of the reason why we made the decisions that we made so weve got a lot of wood to chop there which will play out over a period of time to make that business more efficient and as weve talked about on the consumer banking side weve done i think for many many years after mary got her job in the consumer banking operation our focus was dealing with the cleanup which theyve done an exceptional job in the consumer small business bank about and then turned our attention to becoming more efficient which she has worked really hard on and thats a combination of looking at our branch footprint staffing within the branches migrating people to digital and were behind on that but there has been a lot of progress made over the last yearandahalf to two years and so theres still tremendous amount of opportunity there but its in flight steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc really helpful color just for my followup wanted to unpack some of the nii trends that were seeing within the wealth side specifically and theres a big focus right now on yieldseeking behavior if the higherforlonger rate environment persists you and your peers have seen contraction in nii sequentially and continued deposit outflows was hoping you could speak to whether youre seeing any abatement in just the pace of cash sorting or yieldseeking behavior as of yet or if its continued at a pretty healthy clip michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 yeah ill take that and when you look at the sequential change in nii its really the fewer days in the quarter that drove it otherwise its pretty flat to the fourth quarter as we thought it would be when we talked in january when you think about wealth its been pretty stable the trend its not accelerating its not decelerating at any significant clip at this point and what we see there is were capturing those cash alternatives that people are buying in the wealth business and so i think that trend will continue for a while and the good news is were capturing that in other ways but the trend has been pretty stable and thats probably going to be the case for a little longer steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc helpful color thanks for taking my questions operator the next question will come from john mcdonald of autonomous research your line is open john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning mike was wondering what your outlook is for the second quarter nii and maybe if you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes to that and what youre thinking for second quarter thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah john as you look at as things are trending you can see where deposits are on a periodend and an average basis so thats probably input number one and then you can see that deposit yields have increased right so those two things are going to be the biggest drivers so you should expect a little bit of a stepdown from  into  and well see exactly sort of what that looks like as we get a little bit into the quarter but i think the variables are there to kind of come up with a range of outcomes john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah okay and the outlook for the full year obviously embeds a pretty big stepdown from the first quarter starting point can you give us any more color about the types of assumptions you have embedded into the full year outlook on deposit flows mix shift and reprice beta michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure and as weve talked over the last few quarters theres still a ton of uncertainty out there with regards to really all of the inputs that go into that right and whether its the mix of deposits the absolute level or where pricing will be and so our guide assumes that its still going to be a pretty competitive space for deposits on the pricing side that we will still see some mix shift happening and that well see some moderate declines as people continue to spend and the trends happen so as we talked about even last quarter i think as time goes by we get more and more information and so were hopeful that theres upside to the forecast but well see that in the second half of the year and it will be a function of how all those factors play out but were hopeful that well see that and therell be some upside there john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 okay thanks operator the next question comes from ken usdin of jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning i just want to ask a followup on the cost side so i think were all pretty clear on your view of continuing to hold the core flat from here but i think an ongoing question is just as we look further out and i know theres no crystal ball here like at what point do you get the line of sight when that next wave of gross saves related to all the duplicative and extra buildup in the infrastructure related to risk compliance et cetera when do you get the line of sight of when you can start to sunset that because i know youve talked about that as a big point of how you get the roe up over the medium term michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah ken let me try to clarify a little bit of that so i think when you look at what we talked about last quarter in terms of getting to a rotce in the medium term that didnt assume that we would have to take out significant amount of the costs related to the risk and regulatory buildouts that were doing that efficiency on those expenses will be out a little while it could be years in terms of before we really get at some of that but i think our focus is to get the return to a sustainable in the medium term by not having to rely on that it really goes back to what we talked about really making sure capital gets optimized not just in terms of shareholder return but also across the balance sheet requires us to continue to execute on the efficiency initiatives outside of the risk and regulatory work and then well start to get the benefit of some of the investments weve been making now for the last couple years charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and i would just add to that just to be clear when we think about the opportunities to continue to drive efficiency in the company we dont even think about all the expenses related to the risk and regulatory framework work that were doing that work is and those expenses are theyre necessary and those are not an excuse for us not to be efficient in everything else that we do and so as weve talked about in the consumer businesses a second ago we look across all the things that we do and theres still significant opportunity to just become more efficient and either reduce the expense base or provide more capacity to invest going forward and at some point can we become more efficient in how we run the risk infrastructure of the company probably but thats not on the radar screen and not necessary for us to achieve our efficiency goals ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah and thanks for those clarifications just a question on the fee side i know watching your trading results are a lot different than watching some of the bigger peers but just looking at that billion on the face of the income statement this quarter in the context of the environment can you help us put that into context was that just exceptional result this quarter did it have anything we should be mindful of as we think forward and just your general outlook there thank you michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 yeah sure we certainly benefited from the volatility that we saw particularly in the rate market and some of the other asset classes in the quarter and you can see that in the results but when you look at some of the core platforms in fx and other areas weve been just consistently investing in some of those platforms so hopefully over time youll see good results there but the quarter definitely was influenced by the volatility that we saw across the market ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks very much operator the next question will come from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i just wanted to follow up on the capital comments i guess charlie you talked about this is it fair for us to assume clearly we have the scb coming out of the stress test thatd be one data point and then the basel reforms should we assume that the cet1 likely drifts higher maybe maybe higher in the near term while you still buy back stock is that a right assumption and secondly i think mike you mentioned about optimizing for capital and rwa just maybe if you can call out a few things that you can do to optimize rwa relative to where the balance sheet is today michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure thanks i think the simple answer to your first question is no we dont expect it to continue to keep drifting up certainly well find out the results of ccar with everybody else in june and then weve got basel iv which is a little bit longer timeline than that but were basis points above the regulatory minimum buffers weve got plenty of capital to deal with whatever comes out of that and as we said over time well get closer to basis points or so above the and so i think theres plenty of capacity to deal with whatever comes and continue to return money back to shareholders as charlie said charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and so i think the second part just to be and again all i was trying to say is we have a lot of flexibility to deal with things that come our way and so were not anticipating significant additional capital needs were not anticipating that any potential downturn could create additional capital needs inside of the business all were saying is that if any of those things were to happen we have the flexibility to deal with that both because of the amount of earnings that we have as well as the existing excess capital that we have so you add those i mean you take that and you say all those things happened while we bought billion of stock back this quarter so we feel well be able to continue to return capital and still maintain a very conservative position michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah and then just to give you a couple examples to help illustrate the capital optimization the mortgage business is one of them if we want mortgage exposure we can buy securities you dont have to always hold the mortgage if youre buying securities you dont have to buy umbs you could buy ginnies and so theres plenty and then you could look at each of the underlying portfolios and make sure were getting the return from a wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 relationship point of view that we think whether thats in the commercial bank or the corporate investment bank and so i think theres plenty of areas that we can either reallocate capital to clients that we think well get better returns for or optimize some of the underlying portfolios ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one separate question you made tremendous progress charlie since taking over on the compliance risk management front there was a news article last night talking about some occ mras i dont expect you to comment on that but just give us a sense from a shareholder perspective your level of confidence around the risk of another shoe dropping or a major setback to all the efforts and actions that youve taken to address the regulatory orders to the extent you can just to give comfort that the progress thats been made is getting us closer to the finish line as opposed to another big setback that could push us back again charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah listen i would refer you back to my shareholder letter where i wrote about it extensively and i think i still continue to feel exactly the way we felt when we wrote that letter it wasnt that long ago which is we have continued work to do i feel very confident in our ability to get the work done and that were making progress and so we live in an environment where things can come up thats always the case so we dont want to pretend like there are no risks of other things out there but if there was anything specific we would do our best to let you know and we feel good about the progress that were making and are extremely focused on making sure that weve got all the attention decked against it but were confident that the things that were doing will close the gaps that existed at the company when we got here ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc noted thank you very much operator the next question comes from john pancari of evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning back to the nii drivers can you maybe give us a updated expectation on how youre thinking about loan growth here as you look through i know youve cited some of the pressures on the consumer side but some of the favorable trends still in commercial and then separately on the deposit side do you have an updated expectation regarding your total deposit beta as we see pricing pressure continue michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah thanks so on the loan side i think were definitely seeing pockets of growth in places like the commercial bank and thats been pretty consistent now for a couple quarters but the overall growth rate across total loans has moderated for the last three quarters which is exactly what we thought might happen when we were talking last summer and so i think itll still be pretty moderate i wouldnt expect huge growth in loans over the rest of the year and embedded in our guidance is some low singledigit growth rate in terms of loans for the year and so i think thats what were assuming there what was the second part again john sorry wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 john pancari q analyst evercore isi yeah it was around your updated michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co oh sorry beta deposit beta sorry yeah no look on the deposit side todate betas have played out almost exactly how we thought they would and i think from here the path of rates will matter competition will matter and so as i mentioned earlier in the call were still assuming its going to be pretty competitive when we give you the guidance that we gave you and i think we may find hopefully that it gets that maybe were being a little conservative there but we do think at this point itll still be competitive and i think the betas will be pretty reasonable though on the consumer side when you look back after the rate rises stop john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks mike and then separately on the commercial real estate front maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit on the stress that youre seeing i know you discussed office maybe can you talk about your ltvs in office maybe on a refreshed basis if you happen to have that and maybe in other portfolios as well because clearly the change between origination ltvs versus where were seeing refreshed levels come in are clearly what is motivating some of the impact around reserve behavior so if you can give us a little color there that would be helpful michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure look in the office space right now as many others have said too like this is going to play out over an extended period of time were not seeing a lot of nearterm stress in terms of whether clients are current or seeing very big issues on a propertybyproperty basis at this point but we do expect some of that to come and i think itll be for all of the reasons that everyones reporting on right and in particular itll be in cities that you see weakness in places like san francisco and la a little bit in seattle and so its all the places where either lease rates are already lower than the national average or the secular changes around backtooffice are changing in a little bit more bigger way but its going to take time and we just havent seen it translate into loss content yet and were going very granular propertybyproperty and so giving you ltv numbers from a portfolio at a portfolio basis really isnt that helpful at this point because it really is going to be a matter of what each of these underlying properties look like and what the issues are there and we havent seen a lot of trades happening either recently and so that also will impact how you think about the valuations and what were doing is really just making sure we stress it in a whole bunch of different ways on a property level basis to make sure we understand where the potential issues might come from john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you operator the next question comes from betsy graseck of morgan stanley your line is open wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc good morning hi charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co how are you doing betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc couple questions little bit of followup but one on the credit side wanted to just understand a little bit about the recoveries in commercial i know in the deck you mentioned that commercial ncos were down in part due to higher recoveries and just wanted to understand how long you see those recoveries persisting and is there any driver for them actually increasing from here thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah there really isnt any story there betsy i mean we get recoveries every quarter and there really isnt a significant trend change one way or the other and again its going to come back down to individual underlying issues or situations that drive it quartertoquarter but i wouldnt read too much into the trend betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then separately on the wealth deposits i know earlier in the call you addressed this that you would expect to see the wealth outflows continue at current pace or so for at least a little bit of time im wondering is there any anchor that you can give us with regard to wealth deposits as a percentage of client assets that existed precovid that maybe we should anchor back on in modeling that line item michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i mean what we gave you in my commentary was just cash as a percentage of assets and its quite a bit higher than it was before about now versus and obviously deposits is going to be a subcomponent of that and there are other drivers right of how much cash people are going to hold as a percentage of assets and right now youre seeing a lot of a lot of what is going into cash alts is coming out of other asset classes so its a little harder to give you a specific number of like deposits as a percentage of assets because youre seeing people sell equities and other asset classes and drive up those cash balances wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right and cash for you is its including things like mmf and treasury bills things like that michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co absolutely yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co and so i would just take the current balance that you see in the wealth space and the deposit side and assume it continues to come down at a stable pace for a little bit betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and just last question here on deposit betas i know you indicated that it should be okay i guess im wondering how you think about deposit betas this cycle versus last cycle similar higher lower any sense as to versus prior cycle in magnitude would be great thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah look i mean itll be different obviously and part of whats going to drive that is how long rates stay higher and i think that well find that out over a period of time but as you can tell where betas have performed so far theyve performed pretty well when you look at it relative to the last cycle particularly given how far rates have moved up in excess of what happened last time and theyre behaving exactly as you might think right and if you go portfolio by portfolio the betas are pretty high on the large corporate side thats been the case now for a couple quarters theyre a little bit lower in the commercial bank given the nature of that client base and in the consumer side theyre relatively low given the amount of rate rises that weve seen so far and so i think on the large corporate side youll see those be pretty consistent from here and the consumer side will be a function of all the things we talked about earlier betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thanks so much operator the next question comes from matt oconnor of deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i was hoping you guys could elaborate on the slowing consumer spending towards the end of the month any more color there and any thoughts on whats driving that wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah it was pretty small when you look at that change so i wouldnt read too much into it i think people are still theres still a lot of activity out there and consumers are still out spending both in the debit side and the credit side so i wouldnt read into a couple weeks matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then separately i know i always kind of harp on some of these reg issues and i appreciate the new york post article yesterday you cant comment specifically on but it did allude to some concerns in your trading business and obviously it performed extremely well youve been growing it although i dont think youre growing it super aggressively but theres been some political comments maybe it was i dont know six months ago or so that you shouldnt be growing your capital markets business while youre investing in these other areas so i guess maybe you could just address the trading businesses overall in terms of how youre growing them in a responsible way and how youre making sure the oversight in risk management is fine i mean because again externally it seems like everything is going really well but its hard to tell thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co we have no concerns over what were doing in the business were not increasing risk in any meaningful way weve had strong oversight in that business and we think it continues and we benefited from business activity which is focused on customer flow we have strong financial risk management in the company and have had that for a long period of time we have strong risk management over our trading businesses and controls and i would just be really careful to take the source that youre taking and using that to expand into anything beyond from whence it came if theres anything meaningful to report we report it and as i said we feel really good about the progress that were making and we feel good about the performance of the company and i think that that stands on its own matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats very clear and very helpful thank you operator the next question comes from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi mike mike you talked about some of the reasons why your commercial loan growth was quite strong on a yearoveryear basis can you share with us are you guys seeing any reintermediation where the dcm market was very weak in the quarter for the industry it was weak last year are you guys seeing benefits from that where people corporate and commercial customers are coming to you using your balance sheet more so than possibly a yearandahalf ago michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co not in any meaningful way theres always an anecdotal story im sure out there but i wouldnt say its meaningful wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup i know you gave us some details about the net interest income growth this year indiscernible annualize the first quarter results michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hey gerard we lost you there for a second can you just repeat the whole second part gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc sure you gave us some details on the outlook for net interest income growth up and if you annualize your first quarter number of course that would be greater than the growth for the full year and you gave us the reasons why theres a lot of uncertainty the one specific question though is has your thinking on the yield curve and i know this is very hard nobody can predict it where its going to be but are you thinking that the yield curve and maybe a rate cut could be coming sooner and the yield curve comes down when you look at your outlook or has your outlook for the interest rates changed i guess is the question michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well i think certainly the market expectations are implying that therell be a decrease in the late part of the year and so i think thats certainly being priced in at the moment but i do think that you need to be prepared that thats not going to happen and i think its possible it doesnt so i think as we get a little closer well all know gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co and what we try to do in our guidance is use what the markets telling us right so if that doesnt happen and rates are higher than what the markets implying then there would be a little upside there charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah and the only thing id add is listen in all of this and i tried to say this in our remarks which is weve said constantly we dont know what the future holds we see what the market is saying who knows where the market is right or wrong you have the fed chair whos talking about expect rates higher for longer and so were prepared for a range of scenarios when we think about giving guidance we just try and choose a benchmark which is the market which is its a scenario and pick your own scenario based upon what you all think and you can make your own determination what itll be but were just trying to give you both like a benchmark and what supports that benchmark but also be clear that there are a range of alternatives out there which could make the result differ just trying to be as transparent as we can wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no appreciate the further insights thats very helpful thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator the next question comes from david long of raymond james your line is open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone i appreciate all the color on some of the deposit flows but let me just ask it a little bit different way from a noninterestbearing deposit figure the number the percentages has come down how do you expect that concentration to change over the course of the next several quarters michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well i wouldnt try to predict it exactly over the next couple quarters but i think if you look at were about in the quarter and if you go back a number of years prepandemic that was in the mid and weve said this in other forums that you could see it start to trend towards there will it get down there unknown but i think youll see it trend down a little bit more david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc sure if you look back over call it the last years since the great financial crisis rates have been pretty close to zero outside of a brief period just before the pandemic do you see noninterestbearing deposits going back to pregreatfinancialcrisis levels for wells fargo or the industry where we had numbers there in the mid to high teens charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i think thats almost impossible to predict david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it okay thank you appreciate it operator the last question for today will come from chris kotowski of oppenheimer your line is open chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc yeah good morning and thanks for taking the question i guess i wonder how do you anticipate managing the duration of your investment securities portfolio from here i mean obviously it must have extended out quite a bit last year and we saw the marktomarks on it increase across the industry but i noted kind of the htm portfolio wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 was down about during the quarter and i mean do you anticipate running that down and if so how quickly does it run down if you do nothing michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well i think obviously thats going to be a little bit dependent on rates and where rates go given theres some mortgage securities in the portfolio in terms of the burndown and i think were going to continue to be thoughtful as we have in the past around thinking about the size of the portfolio in total including the afs and thats really a function of a bunch of things including how much loan growth we expect to see over a period of time and then we look at all of the other constraints that weve got to worry about around liquidity and everything else and we decide on how much goes into htm and what the makeup of it is but at this point we feel comfortable with the quantum both in terms of the size of the portfolio and the duration of the portfolio chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay so you anticipate keeping it roughly this size all things being equal or does it run down michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i think well make that decision over time i dont anticipate the portfolio getting much bigger from here over the next few quarters but i think well make that decision over time and then the burndown will be what it is based on where rates and natural maturities of the portfolio go chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay thank you thats it for me charles william scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co all righty everyone thanks so much appreciate it and well talk to you soon michael p santomassimo senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co take care operator thank you all
