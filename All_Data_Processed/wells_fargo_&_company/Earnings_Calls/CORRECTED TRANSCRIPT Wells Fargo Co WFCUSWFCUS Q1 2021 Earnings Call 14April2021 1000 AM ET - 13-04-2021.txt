operating environment and update you on a few important topics ill then turn the call over to mike to review the first quarter results in more detail we earned billion or per common share in the first quarter as you can see these results included a billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses higher net interest income more than offset a decline in net interest income and expenses are just beginning to reflect progress on our efficiency work the impact of this work should increase in the latter half of the year credit quality continued to outperform our expectations with chargeoffs at historical lows but low interest rates and tepid loan demand remained headwinds for us during the quarter and we continue to manage within the constraints of our asset cap which require us to anticipate the inflows from government stimulus effects of qe and additional fiscal actions which could impact our balance sheet overall economic trends improved during the quarter and while there are risks the likelihood of improvement continues to increase and you certainly see this in the markets equity markets are rising spreads have tightened and liquidity is strong additional fiscal stimulus continued monetary support and the acceleration of vaccine wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 availability provide a path to a more complete reopening and further economic expansion us gdp growth is on track to surpass its prepandemic peak by the end of the summer and is expected to increase in by more than any year since overall the consumer is strong though there are inconsistencies which i will address later consumer net worth was up in hitting a new alltime high of trillion personal savings is approximately trillion greater today than it was a year ago its expected that more than trillion will be spent over the next five months and this does not include the impact of president bidens proposed initiatives wells fargo customers specifically as of last week over billion has flowed into our customers deposit accounts related to round two and round three of federal stimulus payments and we estimate half has been spent and half remains in their accounts for our customers who received federal stimulus payments their median deposit balance was up from a year ago and for all of our customers including customers who did not receive stimulus payments median balances were up from a year ago weekly debit card spend was up every week compared to a year ago the first quarter the yearoveryear increase accelerated in midmarch due to the impact of last years covidrelated restrictions and the impact of stimulus payments and was up approximately during this week last year of the quarter compared to a year ago but was up compared to the same week in were seeing increased consumer spending activity in both travel and restaurants two categories that have been particularly suppressed since the onset of covid19 specifically for travel for the week ended april debit card spend was up compared to but was still down compared to consumer credit card weekly spend continues to strengthen over the course of the first quarter as well and ended the quarter up approximately during the last week of the quarter compared to a year ago but importantly up compared to the same week in businesses remain strong as well most clients still have strong cash positions and line utilization remain low the demand for consumer products is high and dealer inventory levels are meaningfully lower versus historical levels after declining during the second half of the year commercial loan balances seem to have stabilized and if the economy continues to pick up we would expect to see increased loan demand from our commercial customers in the second half of the year with the vaccine distribution accelerating im hopeful that we will be shifting to a more normal way of life soon but theres still many that will continue to need help as not all have benefited equally during the recovery throughout the pandemic our focus has been providing support for our customers and the communities we serve and we continued those efforts during the first quarter since the pandemic began weve helped million consumer and small business customers by deferring payments and waiving fees in addition to our billion of ppp funding in in the first quarter we funded approximately loans totaling billion under the latest round of the paycheck protection program this year we focused even more on small and diverse businesses and our average loan size was down from last year we have the lowest average loan size amongst our large bank peers have been for businesses with fewer than employees have gone to businesses in either lowtomoderate income areas or majorityminority census tracks totaling more than billion between this year and last year we committed last year to donate approximately million of our fees from the ppp program and established our open for business fund were in the process of distributing these funds to a combination of cdfis and not wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 forprofits that serve diverse small businesses todate we have distributed over million and are working to accelerate distribution of the remaining funds we estimate that these actions have protected more than jobs and hope to make an even more substantial impact with the funds remaining as we announced yesterday we have invested in black minorityowned deposit institutions as part of our million commitment to support mdis we expect to complete our investments in another two by the end of the second quarter and as i mentioned before we processed over billion of customer deposits related to the federal stimulus payments through last week and have cashed stimulus payments for noncustomers without charging fees while were proud of these actions we know there is still more to do lowerincome families and individuals as well as minorityowned small businesses will continue to need support and we will continue to look for ways to help climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time and last month wells fargo announced a major step in our efforts to support the transition to a lowcarbon economy by setting a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions including financed emissions by we committed to publish data on our financed emissions and set interim goals as we work closely with our clients in this transition we also released our first task force on climaterelated financial disclosures report in the first quarter which provides an update on our progress managing climaterelated risks and opportunities let me turn to make some comments about our strategic priorities last quarter in my shareholder letter i discussed the and in the shareholder letter actions were taking to improve our performance and were making good progress we continue to prioritize the work necessary to build the appropriate risk and control infrastructure and it remains our top priority as a reminder this is a multiyear journey progress may not be a straight line and while we still have significant work to do we are diligently doing whats necessary issue by issue its hard to share specifics given the nature of the work but i believe were making progress and were confident in our ability to complete the work in terms of business exits i highlighted on the call last quarter that we were focusing our efforts on our core scaled businesses and after rigorous reviews we were in the process of exploring options for businesses that were not consistent with our strategic priorities mike will cover the financial details but in the first quarter we announced agreements to sell wells fargo asset management and the corporate trust services businesses and both are expected to close in the secondhalf of this year in addition we completed a portion of the sale of the student loan portfolio and we completed the sale of the majority of the remaining portfolio recently were pleased that we have found buyers who we believe have a similar approach to service and are focused on providing clients with innovative products and solutions these announcements are an important step to simplifying our business and allowing us to focus on our core strategic priorities our work to simplify how we operate and create a more efficient organization continues we made progress on our branch staffing and network optimization plans as we calibrate for changing customer behaviors and more traffic migrates to digital channels we continued to execute on our commercial banking transformation as we optimize our coverage and operations model consolidate lending platforms and automate and standardize many manual processes such as onboarding a customer pain point which has been key for us and across the entire enterprise we continue our ongoing efforts to reduce management layers to speed decisionmaking and reduce unnecessary bureaucracy were also focused on moving our businesses forward a few examples on the consumer banking side were accelerating our investments in digital with a particular focus on delivering a simple easytouse bestinclass customer experience for the mostused mobile app features were also simplifying and enhancing our product line including launching clear access banking our lowcost no wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 overdraft product and weve opened over new accounts since the launch last fall and this summer we will be improving the benefits of our portfolio by wells fargo checking customers as ive spoken about before were underpenetrated in credit card given our customer footprint and were working on developing a significantly improved value proposition that we can introduce to the market and on the commercial side were going after the middlemarket investment banking opportunity in a different way than we have previously this includes joint accountability investments in talent namebyname client prioritization and joint account planning mike will discuss capital more in his remarks but our position remains extremely strong we repurchased almost million of common stock in the quarter and based on the restrictions still in place for the second quarter we have the capacity to return approximately billion to shareholders as a reminder our asset cap limits our ability to deploy excess capital to our customers returning capital to shareholders remains a priority and we look forward to resuming capital returns under the stress capital buffer methodology starting in the third quarter last quarter i discussed constraints to achieving return on tangible common equity greater than and then around i should note that those returns did not include credit loss reserve releases the asset cap and capital return restrictions continue but the progress on vaccination distribution ongoing monetary policy additional fiscal stimulus and higher interest rates are helpful were in the midst of a multiyear transformation and im confident that our operational and financial performance will continue to benefit from the progress were making id like to end by acknowledging that weve asked so much of our entire wells fargo team and im proud of all the work theyve done to support our customers and the communities we serve we will continue to do all we can to support an equitable recovery and help those most in need of our support i will now turn the call over to mike michael santomassimo senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thanks charlie and good morning everyone charlie highlighted many other ways were actively helping our customers and communities which we highlighted on slide so im going to start with our first quarter financial results on slide net income for the quarter was billion or per common share revenue grew from both a year ago and the fourth quarter as the decline in net interest income was more than offset by higher non interest income our first quarter results included a billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses and as a reminder in the first half of last year we built reserves by a total of billion and we had billion of allowance for credit losses at the end of the first quarter we completed the sale of approximately half of our student loan portfolio in the first quarter which resulted in a million gain and million goodwill writedown and we closed the majority of the remaining portfolio just this past weekend our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was which included net discrete income tax benefits related to closing out prioryears tax matters our capital and liquidity remained strong our cet1 ratio increased to under the standardized approach and under the advanced approach we repurchased million shares of common stock for a total of million and we had billion of excess capital over our cet1 regulatory minimum at quarter end our liquidity coverage ratio was wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 turning to slide which summarizes the financial impact of the business sales charlie highlighted we have included the revenue and expense associated with the businesses on the slide while they represented a little over of revenue the pretax earnings is much smaller note that the table does not include the credit cost associated with the student loan portfolio which can have a meaningful impact on the business pl and the expected expense reductions related to this business are incorporated into our billion outlook for the year also the expenses weve included related to the corporate trust and asset management businesses are the total expenses for those businesses some of those expenses may continue after we close the deals as we have transitioned service agreements and roughly to of those expenses are items such as corporate overhead that will take time to manage out of the expense run rate in terms of segment reporting the asset management business is now reported in corporate given that we announced the sale of the corporate trust business late in the quarter that business is still included in commercial banking and will move to the corporate sector in the second quarter turning to credit quality on slide our net chargeoff ratio in the first quarter declined to basis points the lowest its been in a number of years and down basis points from a year ago our losses have trended significantly better than our expectations due to the impact of forbearance programs and the unprecedented amounts of government stimulus while theres still a lot of uncertainty there are encouraging and improving trends related to commercial credit quality commercial net loan chargeoffs declined million from the fourth quarter to basis points the lowest loss rate since the third quarter of the improvement was broadbased with declines in all asset types including million of lower commercial real estate losses as we have done since the start of the pandemic we continued to closely monitor our exposure to retail hotel and office property types the reopening of the economy has had a positive impact on retail and hotel as cash flow levels have begun to improve that said stress remains and retail in particular was the driver of chargeoffs in the first quarter though clearly there are negative demand trends in many office markets the office portfolio continued to perform well and were not seeing widespread stress in the portfolio as of now consumer net chargeoffs declined million from a year ago with improvements across all asset types but increased million for the fourth quarter with higher losses in other consumer loans and credit card but still continued to be low nonperforming assets declined million or from the fourth quarter driven by lower commercial nonaccruals primarily due to declines in energy and commercial real estate nonaccruals billion of our consumer loan portfolio excluding government insured loans remained in covidrelated payment deferrals at the end of the first quarter we stopped offering nonrealestaterelated covid referrals in the fourth quarter and of the balances that were still in deferral at quarterend were real estate related loans that have already exited covid deferrals have continued to perform better than we anticipated with over of the balances current as of the end of the first quarter though were still not all the way back to prepandemic levels weve continued to adjust our credit policies to reflect better economic conditions due to the reserve release in the first quarter our allowance coverage ratio declined from the fourth quarter but was up basis points from a year ago similar to the fourth quarter while observed performance has been strong there was still a significant amount of uncertainty reflected in our allowance level at the end of the first wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 quarter and well continue to assess the level of our allowance if the economic trends continue we would expect to have additional reserve releases on slide we highlight loans and deposits our average loans declined for the third consecutive quarter and were down from a year ago the decline from the fourth quarter was driven by lower residential real estate loans due to continued high prepayments and resecuritization of loans we purchased out of mortgagebacked securities last year real estate loan balances have been impacted by actions we took early last year to discontinue correspondent nonconforming originations in home equity lending we have started to originate correspondent nonconforming loans again and should start to see more volume from this channel over time commercial loans were relatively stable from the fourth quarter but were down from a year ago when there was a strong borrower draw activity during the early stages of the pandemic average deposits grew billion or from a year ago and from the fourth quarter with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking partially offset by declines in the corporate investment and banking business corporate treasury reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap with continued deposit growth we have been actively managing down our longterm debt outstanding we tendered for billion of senior and subordinated debt in the first quarter and along with maturities total long term debt declined billion or from the fourth quarter and was down from a year ago turning to net interest income on slide net interest income declined from the fourth quarter driven by two fewer days unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results continued repricing of the balance sheet and lower loan balances these impacts were partially offset by the benefit of lower longterm debt on the call last quarter we provided our net interest income outlook we still expect net interest income to be flattodown from the annualized fourth quarter level of billion as the benefit of a steeper yield curve has been largely offset by softer than anticipated loan demand low utilization rates on commercial loans and faster than expected prepayments on residential mortgages that said its important to recognize we are still early in the year and our ultimate results for the year will remain dependent on how rate and lending environments evolve if rates follow the current forward curve and commercial loans grow as the economic recovery gains momentum which is expected by the industry we would expect nii to land near the high end of the range however if loan demand proves softer than expectations our total loan balance or and our total loan balance remains flat compared with where we ended the first quarter we would expect to finish closer to the middle of the range we continue to closely monitor the evolving trends across each of the major drivers and will provide updates to our outlook as the year progresses turning to expenses on slide noninterest expense increased from a year ago driven by increased personnel expense deferred comp expense reduced personnel expenses in the first quarter of last year by million as a reminder late in the second quarter of last year we changed how we hedge deferred compensation which reduced the volatility in our reporting for this item starting in the third quarter of last year personnel expense also increased from a year ago from higher incentive and revenuerelated compensation including the impact of higher market valuations on stockbased compensation which was partially offset by lower salaries all other expense was down from a year ago driven by lower professional services expense due to efficiency initiatives our expenses declined from the fourth quarter as seasonally higher personnel expense was more than offset by lower restructuring charges and operating losses our expense outlook is unchanged at approximately billion with lower annualized expenses towards the end of the year as we said on our last wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 earnings call our outlook excludes restructuring charges and the costs of business exits such as the million goodwill writedown related to the sale of student loans we assumed billion of operating losses in the outlook the first quarter included million of operating losses but as you know these expenses can be lumpy especially as we continue to resolve legacy issues we also assumed approximately million of incremental revenuerelated expenses as these have been higherthanexpected so far this year due to strong equity markets which is a good thing as revenue more than offsets any increase if the current market level holds we would expect incremental revenuerelated compensations this year to be approximately million but we are still early in the year and will update you as the year progresses we are continuing to execute on efficiency initiatives and additional initiatives continue to be identified and vetted turning to our business segments starting with consumer banking and lending on slide net income increased from a year ago driven by revenue growth in home lending and lower provision for credit losses consumer and small business banking revenue declined from a year ago primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates and lower depositrelated fees the decline in depositrelated fees was driven by higher average checking account balances and higher covidrelated fee waivers we expect a high level of paycheck protection program loan forgiveness in the second quarter which would result in higher net interest income but as a reminder the fees on those loans originated last year are being donated so you will see a corresponding increase in donation expense so it wont impact the bottom line home lending revenue increased from a year ago on higher retail originations and gain on sale margins the increase from the fourth quarter was primarily due to higher mortgage banking income related to the re securitization of loans we purchased from mortgagebacked securities last year and an increase in retail originations credit card revenue declined from both the fourth quarter and a year ago due to lower loan balances reflecting elevated payment rates we continue to make progress in executing our efficiency initiatives in our branches transaction volume continues to shift away from our branches with of consumer and small business deposits in the first quarter done digitally up from a year ago we have closed branches since the first quarter of including branches in the first quarter of were on track to complete the remainder of the branches we expect to consolidate this year weve also continued to adjust staffing levels including the reductions related to branch closures importantly to date weve been able to make these adjustments while reducing customer attrition and improving client satisfaction turning to some key business drivers on slide our first quarter retail mortgage origination volume was the highest since total mortgage originations increased from a year ago as a billion decline in correspondent originations was more than offset by billion of higher retail originations total mortgage originations declined from the fourth quarter due to the seasonal slowdown in the purchase market and as growth in retail originations was more than offset by decline in correspondent originations while the mortgage origination market is expected to decline in the second quarter as the anticipated increase in the seasonal purchase market is expected to be more than offset by decline in refinancings we currently expect our origination volume to be robust as we have strong demand in the retail channel and we continue to build up volume in the correspondent nonconforming market wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 auto originations increased from the fourth quarter and from a year ago in a strong market with supply shortages for both new and used cars with the improving economic forecast we are gradually returning to pre pandemic underwriting policies turning to debit card purchase volume increased from seasonally strong fourth quarter levels debit card volume increased from a year ago reflecting higher consumer spending due to stimulus payments and improving economic conditions and credit card purchase volume declined from seasonally high fourth quarter levels purchase volume was up from a year ago as lower yearoveryear volume early in the quarter due to continued reductions in travel and entertainment spend was more than offset by growth in march commercial banking net income was up from both the fourth quarter and a year ago due to decline in the provision for credit losses middle market banking revenue declined from a year ago driven by the impact of lower interest rates as well as lower loan balances from reduced client demand and line utilization assetbased lending and leasing revenue grew from a year ago driven by higher net gains and equity securities in our strategic capital business as first quarter included impairments due to decline in market valuations this was partially offset by lower net interest income in the first quarter of from lower loan balances noninterest expense increased from a year ago primarily driven by higher technology spend partially offset by lower head count and consulting expense related to efficiency initiatives average loans declined for the third consecutive quarter and were down from a year ago as covidrelated draws were repaid and loan demand and credit line utilization remained weak average deposits were up from a year ago as stimulus programs have injected significant liquidity into the market turning to the corporate and investment banking business on slide in banking revenue declined from a year ago driven by the impact of lower interest rates and lower deposit balances and grew from the fourth quarter the linkedquarter growth was driven by a increase in investment banking revenue with strong debt and equity originations partially offset by decline in advisory fees from strong fourth quarter levels commercial real estate revenue grew from a year ago primarily due to improved cmbs gain on sale margins driven by spread tightening as well as an increase in low income housing tax credit income markets revenue increased from a year ago and strong client demand for assetbacked finance products other credit products and municipal bonds which was partially offset by lower demand for rates products and lower equities and commodities revenue average deposits declined and average tradingrelated assets were down from a year ago primarily driven by continued actions weve taken to manage under the asset cap as i mentioned earlier wealth and investment management results exclude wells fargo asset management which is now reported in corporate and prior periods have been revised net income declined in the business from the fourth quarter revenue grew reflecting higher assetbased fees and higher retail brokerage transactional activity expenses were up due to seasonally higher personnel expense net income declined from a year ago reflecting the impact of low interest rates on net interest income partially offset by the higher assetbased fees we ended the first quarter with record client assets of trillion up from a year ago reflecting strong market performance net flows into advisory accounts improved in the first quarter from a year ago in the fourth quarter average deposits were up from a year ago and average loans increased from a year ago largely due to customer demand for securitiesbased lending offerings slide highlights our corporate results which included billion of lower net interest income from a year ago primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates offset by a billion increase in noninterest income first wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 quarter included equity impairments in our affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships and results in the first quarter of included a million gain on the sale of the student loans portfolio non interest expense declined from the fourth quarter on lower restructuring charges and well now take your questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question i guess first one i wanted to ask about is on nii guidance so specifically in terms of premium amortization theres about a million delta between todays level of premium and where it was a year ago does that last years level of about million or so does that represent in your mind a pretty typical level and then kind of how quickly does it move back down to there michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hey scott its mike you know i think you really got to remember what happened last year that would have impacted premium amor right it was a bit of an abnormal quarter as you sort of got to the end of the quarter i think from here i think based on what were seeing premium amort probably has peaked in the first quarter and starts to trend down from here how long it takes to sort of get to a kind of normalized view i think well see over the next well have a better clarity on that i think over the next couple quarters but we would expect it to start trending down from here r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then just a separate question so the lending recovery is kind of a big question for you guys and others i guess just regardless of what happens with industry trends maybe if you could speak to where you feel you guys are getting your fair share of loan growth and where you think you might still need to do better i know you had mentioned for example credit card as being very underpenetrated but just curious to get broader thoughts there as well michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah look as what youll probably hear from a lot of folks the demand across really most commercial client segments has been pretty weak now and probably has stabilized or seems to have stabilized over the last couple of months but i think well sort of see how that progresses into later this quarter i think as we sort of look at where the opportunity is as the economy and the momentum in the economy really starts to take off more its really acrosstheboard in our core client segments in our middle market our commercial banking more broadly i think there will be opportunity in kind of the core large corporate segment maybe to a lesser degree but we do really expect to see that commercial banking demand start to pick up as the economy picks up and so i would sort of highlight that i think charlie has talked a wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 lot about the credit card space i think therell be growth there but given sort of the relative size of our portfolio to the balance sheet i think that the impact there will be modest to the overall size of sort of our loan portfolio r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right thats perfect thank you very much for taking the questions operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys just wondering mike if you can kind of just recodify that expense commentary for the year you said the billion number and then you also talked about the revenuerelated lift of about million so was that just the reset to indiscernible all things equal i just want to make sure we know what that includes and doesnt include and how you expect it to traject from here thanks michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure ken thanks for the question so if you recall how we sort of set the billion target ill just give you a little bit of the background there that we covered last quarter so embedded in that billion target was an increase of about billion of revenuerelated expenses and about billion of operating losses sort of embedded in there and what we excluded from there is the cost to exit the businesses which we saw a little bit this quarter the million or so this quarter for the student loans business and any restructuring charges that come throughout the year so as you sort of think about the goforward piece of it the billion we still feel really good about i think whats putting a little bit of pressure on that is the incremental million of revenuerelated expense so i dont think its a foregone conclusion that were going to be million higher but i do think thats putting pressure on the billion so its possible were a little over that if the revenuerelated expenses hold which by the way should be a good thing right because that means theres plenty of revenue on the other side of that to offset it ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and that was going to be my followup mike which is was the revenue uplift what you had already seen in the first quarter or is it things that you feel better about going forward that we havent necessarily seen yet but youre now anticipating a better revenue environment michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah we did see a little bit of it in the first quarter as equity markets outperformed i think everyones expectations so if those market levels hold throughout the rest of the year thats when youll see the rest of that revenue related comp come in and so youll see the revenue associated with it throughout the rest of the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 okay and then im sorry just last one on it are you still expecting the end of year on expenses to be lower than the beginning as you had said also in the fourth quarter that trajectory still holds directionally michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah directionally thats right well get more benefit from the efficiency initiatives that were executing later in the year so that will sort of impact the runrate and i would just point out and remind people that we do have a lot of seasonal expenses that hit the first quarter and so you sort of need to normalize for those as you go out for the rest of the year as well ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great okay thanks mike operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning my first question is a clarification question for mike clearly the market responded to this comment i think you noted that if loan growth was going to be continue to be tough this year that nii would be down from annualized fourth quarter which i think the market is taking that youre bringing in your nii guide for the year and i just wanted to make sure we had interpreted that correctly that it seems like a more realistic outlook for nii now with the curve steepening and perhaps green shoots on loan growth is flattodown michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah no thanks erika for the question our guidance still holds that down its somewhere between flat to the fourth quarter runrate to down and consistent to what we said in the first quarter to get to the top of the range we needed to see we need to see some loan growth thats still the case although rates have offset some weakness that weve seen so far and i think to get to kind of the middle of the range we really need rates to kind of hold where they are and we wont need a lot of loan growth from here to hit that but i think theres plenty of scenarios that you can sort of think through that put you somewhere else in the range but what we tried to give you were a couple kind of realistic data points relative to where we think whats possible in terms of where well land within the range erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it very helpful and my second question is for charlie charlie clearly the market is reacting to what seems to be a brighter revenue picture for wells and continued progress in your transition and turnaround and it feels like its shrugging off typically your stock wouldnt be up after saying that expenses can flip higher and clearly the market doesnt care given the revenue outlook i guess im wondering as we look forward to and hearing you loud and clear in some of the investments that youve already planning to make in the consumer side what are the puts and takes in terms of a greater bottomline benefit from the second half of that billion of cost savings that youve identified versus an economic picture that has clearly brightened even over the past three months in other words should we think of your expenses having a higher floor lets say billion to billion as we look out to and obviously that would come with greater efficiencies as revenue continues to improve wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co okay thanks erika listen i dont think theres anything more that were going to say in terms of what we would expect expenses to be going forward beyond what mike covered in his remarks and what weve said on last quarter when we look at the opportunities to continue to drive efficiency in the company which is really all about just running a better company those continue to be extremely significant we laid out just on a gross basis what we thought those opportunities were and our degree of confidence in being able to achieve that given the level of specificity that we had and the lineofsight and i think that still holds true and over time we would expect to continue to find more kind of peeling the onion back and at the same time we are investing in the business and its on the consumer side its on data its across the home lending platform the card platform our products in the consumer bank what were doing in our middle market business with technology account i can go on and on of all of the things that were doing and so i think thats all embedded in our statement that we would expect the fourth quarter in order to get to billion just would clearly be a lower runrate than the billion itself and then as we look forward we hope to see net expense reductions as we continue to drive efficiency while continuing to add investments into the business so hopefully thats responsive to what you were asking erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you charlie strong message this quarter appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i had a question around how youre thinking about the dividend and the buybacks we know that post ccar stress test assuming you pass that that theres a little bit more room for you to do both of those things so maybe you could give us a sense as to how you would approach the buyback and the dividend decision poststress test and in particular what kind of timeframe are you thinking about that you would need to optimize the capital structure down to your management targets because youre sitting with a lot of excess capital today as you know charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure mike why dont i start and then you can pick up i guess wed start with the dividend its not lost on us that our dividend is quite low certainly relative to where were earning today and as we look forward and we all know thats a consequence of two things its a consequence of the restrictions that were put in place by the fed in wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 terms of what those limitations were but it was also a point of view that we had which was we didnt want to have to if the environment even would get worse from that point in time be in a position to have to reduce the dividend again so we would like to increase the dividend to a more reasonable level we think about it as targeting a payout ratio excluding reserve releases and things like that and then beyond that it is investment in the business its deploying our capital for our clients and the difference being buybacks ultimately just given the amount of excess capital that we have today and mike you can talk a little bit about the timing michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah and as you sort of think about timing obviously weve got a lot of components to sort of think about there but you sort of think about it over the next year or so or year i think that sort of gets you probably a reasonable timeframe to sort of work our way down assuming as weve been told that the restrictions come off and were back to sort of a more normal stress capital buffer regime and so i would sort of think about it over that timeframe betsy in terms of what the timing looks like indiscernible michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co ccar and the results and how that all plays out betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and on the payout ratios i mean the dividend had been on the higher end of the peer group but your peer groups running somewhere between and and thats i would think what you mean by reasonable im not asking you to tell me what ratio but i guess im asking you is that the right peer group or would you say you should widen your aperture a little bit and go more like to bring in some of the gsibs in there michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah look i think as you sort of think about the payout ratio over time i think well sort of come up and obviously its going to be a board decision betsy in terms of what the dividend trajectory sort of looks like but its not lost on us that we need to sort of be in a reasonable sort of payout range over time and obviously thats going to be dependent upon what we think the earnings capacity is going to look like and so i think youll see that sort of come through over time and as we sort of have more ability to distribute capital betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks a lot charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 yeah and i guess what ill just add betsy just real quick is i think the way the numbers and whatnot the way you talked about it is generally the right way to think about it in terms of how we number one we were clearly high relative to what others were and in terms of what we probably make sense for us so thats not the way were thinking about it more longterm range in terms of what i think you talked about is right and you know we would like to do something sooner rather than later and that might not get us to where we ultimately want to be but it would be i think an important step thats the direction that were going betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thanks so much for the color charlie and mike appreciate it charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning just on the margin front i just wanted to see if you could quantify the impact of the hedge ineffectiveness on the net interest margin this quarter and then separately could you just talk about margin expectations from here just given the rate backdrop indiscernible looking at the bottom here and we could see some upside as we move through the rest of the year thanks michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure john its mike the hedge ineffectiveness had about a basis point impact on net interest margin and as you probably know well get that back a negative basis point impact and well get that back over time these are hedge ineffectiveness is sort of a temporary difference that comes back as you sort of look think about the outlook from here if the case that we sort of laid out that gets us to the top of our nii range plays out in the way that underpins that then we should see some growth in both nii and nim from here and so this hopefully will be either bottom or pretty close to the bottom as you sort of look forward if that case plays out now as you know nim can move around a little bit quarter to quarter so you might have that bounce around but the general trajectory should be positive john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay got it mike thanks and then last separately on the cost save side i know you expect about billion to fall to the bottom line of the billion this year can you maybe help us think about the magnitude that can fall to the bottom line of the remaining savings of the remaining billion as received any additional color you can provide this quarter now that youre beginning to peel the onion as you noted earlier thanks michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah john i would just go back to what we just talked about a few minutes ago as you sort of think about the trajectory of the expenses well get more of that impact as we go throughout the year and as charlie just wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 mentioned the runrate as we go into the fourth quarter will be lower at a lower rate and as we sort of think about the investments we need to make and also the additional efficiency initiatives that we vet and sort of are working on on top of what we talked about last quarter play out well provide more guidance on that as we think about when we get later in the year charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and this is charlie i just want to add a couple of things if i can first of all ill just remind everyone that we have a tremendous amount of work to do on our control environment and when you look at the consent orders and all those things and so no one has asked about that and again theres really very little that we can say as i said in my prepared remarks but we have a lot of work to do were committed to spend whatever is necessary and it is a significant amount of money and as we get into next year were not going to lock ourselves into a certain number because we have to spend whats appropriate and so as we get closer well be in a better position to give you more color but given its three quarters away it just doesnt make any sense and i also just want to just remark we are very focused on improving efficiency of the company but the world is moving really quickly we have a lot of work to do in terms of building the businesses and putting ourselves in a position so that we do create the kind of revenue growth that we would expect to be able to get out of this franchise and so thats just a reminder part of the reason why were not being too specific about what we expect beyond this year because as we continue to do our work and plan for the future we need to have the ability to do whats necessary to build the company for the longterm while we still said we still would expect expenses to be down on a net basis as we look into the out years but more to come as time goes on john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thanks charlie operator your next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc charlie weve talked a lot about the businesses and becoming more efficient if you will and focusing on those that impact your strategic priorities are there any businesses that you would like to increase your critical mass in or new businesses to get into that you think would be helpful to your strategic priorities charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 i think so on your the first point i think when we look at these four businesses that we report publicly we generally believe that there are material growth prospects in all of them all for very very different reasons and so its hard to sit here today and say whether one should be a little bit higher than the others but i think we feel great about the positions we have we feel great about the opportunities in each and so i think that should be thats an honest assessment of the way we view our businesses what was the second part of the question again im sorry david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc just are there any holes or any opportunities that you see to increase critical mass in any specific indiscernible those business lines just thinking about any areas where if you had some excess capital could you invest it there to gain some market share enhance your goal to improve your strategic priority outlook charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i think all the things that we have to do at this point are continuing to build out the products and services that we have at the core of the franchise i mean we are spending a significant amount of money and i think weve got a significant opportunity given the size of our consumer footprint and in terms of what we should be doing from a digital perspective the way we kind of look at it internally is were in the game but were not at all a market leader in terms of what our digital capabilities are we have a very very clear roadmap about what we intend to build out and we would start to be bringing those things to market this year but as i said when we talk about what were spending this year in that billion that is included in there and weve got opportunities like that across all of the businesses so i think were not in a position to buy anything at this point our focus is on spending our money to strengthen what we have but still believe that there are material opportunities to do that some shorterterm some longerterm david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you charlie appreciate the color charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning just a longterm strategic question trying to look past the asset cap and everything as we think about the investment bank what is the vision for that longerterm youve got a competitive advantage in the slr which is becoming more and more evident with the fed exemption going away i think youre about basis points above peers is there a way to better leverage that and then maybe if you could also comment on the equity trading and ph if not huge numbers but was that impacted by a hedge fund out there wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co so let me start i think our aspirations in the for our corp investment bank its actually interesting because i actually other than the fact that were not afraid to talk about it i actually dont think about it being really all that different from what weve been doing over the past bunch of years when you look at our results the corporate investment bank is an extremely important part of the company thats not because i declared anything differently all we did is we broke out the results so you actually saw the importance of it a significant part of it is the corporate bank but the investment bank is a meaningful portion of it as well and so as we think about what it should look like going forward we want to continue to build out the corporate investment bank as weve been doing in a very linear way not in an exponential way not moving beyond our risk appetite that kind of defines what wells fargo is but just by serving the existing customers that we have in those parts of the company in a much more holistic way and ultimately over a period of time that does allow you to expand your reach in terms of what your client base is and so were focused on the products and services that our predominantly us customers want from us weve talked about the opportunities to penetrate the corporate investment banking products into the middlemarket but its true of theres significant opportunities in the large corporate market in the us where weve got significant treasury management relationships material lending relationships and were completely under penetrated in terms of what fees are for those customers relative to at other institutions so thats the way were thinking about it and again i would just stress its a continuation of building it out in a methodical way not focusing on using risk in order to grow share but focusing on our customer relationships that we have because we have a shot and just to be clear on the equity piece that youre talking about just remember we do have an equity platform which you can see in our results i would just describe in terms of a prime brokerage business because im sure well get a question on it so ill just answer it now our exposure in total in our individual exposures i would describe as just very consistent with the size of our platform we manage it the way we in terms of risk the way we manage all the risks in the corporate investment bank and i think weve seen the results over a period of time there in terms of what that means because its not just what you do its how you do it and so we did have a relationship with archegos we said publicly that we were always wellcollateralized we exited it with all of our exposure with no loss and ill just add that we had substantial excess collateral after liquidation so it just says again in terms of the way we think about how we want to manage businesses that have risk in it not that well be perfect all the time and as is the case in all events the lessons to be learned both in terms of what weve done and what others have done and well factor that into how we manage the businesses as we always would michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co and i would just add just one thing as you sort of think about our growth from here we are a bit constrained in growing our investment bank with the asset cap restrictions that we have in place given the significant growth that weve seen in consumer deposits in particular so as you sort of think about that timeline and that approach charlie said thatll take some time to sort of play out charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 just to reiterate that as we look at the actions that weve had to take to accommodate all the liquidity that weve seen the corporate investment bank has beared the biggest brunt in terms of where weve actually gone to create a bunch of that capacity so as we think about the future the first step is actually just getting back to where we were so matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just to clarify the decline in equity trading yearoveryear is that just if it wasnt from archegos is that distortion from the retirement theres just some noise i think related to that in a yearago comp is that whats driving that michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co its just activity levels in our business and our business is a little bit different than others a little bit smaller cash business that sort of i think drove a lot of activity this quarter so i think theres a number of factors driving it no individual item thats significant matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so why dont i start off with a question for mike just on the fee income outlook lots of little moving pieces in the quarter but how should we be thinking about the appropriate jumping off point for core fee income as we think about the completion of the business sales and maybe some normalization in ib and mortgage activity i know theres more explicit guidance thats been given on the nii side i was hoping maybe you could unpack how we should be thinking about that core fee income run rate from here pro forma the completion of those sales michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah so obviously weve given you a lot of detail on those sales so you can model in the impact that thats going to have on fee income pretty easily as you sort of think about some of the other big line items underneath that we had about billion in the quarter for advisory and other assetbased fees primarily in our wealth business and as you sort of think about the key driver there its going to be equity market levels and so you can model what you think is going to happen there plus flows that may come in as you said another billion in the mortgage business that is a bit cyclical as you sort of pointed out but given what we see at this point for the second quarter we expect to have robust origination volumes in our business and so that should be a good quarter at least and as rates continue to rise youll see some impact there in terms of volume impact there as you look at some of the other pieces youve got deposit and lending fees just under a couple billion dollars there too i think those are pressured in the short run but should see some normalization and growth over time youve got card fees which should grow with economic activity and then youve got another couple billion thats wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 kind of id kind of characterize as more transactional in nature whether its commissions or investment banking fees and so i think if you sort of think about it that way you can probably come up with a few drivers that sort of help you model that in a way that gives you a view on where its headed steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that color and just for my followup on nii maybe focusing on liquidity deployment you guys are in a very strong excess liquidity position i know that a couple of quarters ago and i think mike it was actually your predecessor who alluded to the fact that your appetite was tepid to redeploy some of that excess into securities just given at that point in time the curve was flat as a pancake now that weve seen some incremental steepening was hoping you could speak to whats contemplated in the nii guidance in terms of excess liquidity deployment and your appetite to actually grow the securities book from here given your liquidity capacity to do so michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah no as you point out weve got plenty of capacity and i think as you look at what happened in the quarter kind of in a marginal way a little under billion weve increased the portfolio so we started to redeploy a bit of it but as you sort of point out although the curve has steepened rates are still relatively low and so were working to balance sort of the shortterm carry were going to get by redeploying faster with oci impacts over time and how to do this in the most effective way and when we get good entry points were taking advantage of it so i would think that were going to continue to redeploy at a prudent pace as we see opportunities that sort of make sense from a not just the shortterm carry view but also all the other items that we sort of need to take into account as we sort of look forward steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great thanks so much for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs saul you may be on mute saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc sorry about that i was on mute mike i believe you mentioned that the expenses or some of the expenses associated with the asset management business and the corporate trust business will be sticky and will remain for a bit and were talking about annual in about billion in aggregate whats still a little bit unclear to me is in the billion expense number what proportion of that billion or billion is embedded in the billion guide and i guess as an adjunct to that i guess can you just talk about how sticky those expenses what proportion of those expenses will stick around how do they roll off over what time period because i guess what im a little bit sensitive to is with the sale of the three businesses youre creating about a billion revenue hole and just want to make sure that we understand that theres no notable impact on the expense base so if you can just help us unpack some of this stuff it would be helpful michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 yeah no its a good question so as you sort of think about corporate trust and asset management we assume that those expenses would be here for the full year in the billion so theres no saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co no savings assumed relative to the outlook we gave you so thats sort of i guess point number one on the other parts of the question what we were trying to point out is with both of these businesses probably certainly for the corporate trust business to maybe a greater degree well have some transition services agreements as they take on and migrate these businesses so some of the expenses stay some of that will get offset in other items but some of those expenses will stay as part of those agreements so not everything transitions sort of day one thats sort of point number one point number two on it is that as you would expect theres a portion of these expenses that are more shared across the organization i used sort of corporate overhead just as an example so itll take us a little longer to work the majority of that out and so i characterize that at somewhere between and of it will take a little bit longer and then i guess lastly as we sort of get to closing on these deals well be transparent and provide an update to our guidance on how these will impact it saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it but if were thinking about in relation to the sort of the ongoing expense runrate which is reflected in the billion really the billion im just looking at asset management and corporate trust that the bulk of that should by that point assuming the deals close should call it i dont know of that should be out of the run rate by next year michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah subject to any impact from transition services agreements saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it right michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co so as i said as we get closer well give you more indiscernible charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co which we would get paid for in revenue wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah as charlie said saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co in most cases for these transition service agreements well have some expense still there but well get reimbursed and the way the accounting works on that is just geography well get some revenue and offset by these expenses saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc is there a reason why these are not placed in discontinued operations until the deal closes michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well i think we moved asset management to corporate and so saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc right michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co we moved it out of the segment that its in and as i noted on the call well move corporate trust out of the commercial banking segment in the second quarter so saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co youll be able to clearly see sort of the impact of it in the operating segments saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it all right thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hey mike two quick cleanup items just on the tax rate can you remind us whats making the tax rate low this year and whether the reserve releases puts upward pressure on that and then more importantly what is it sustainably low as you could look out into further years because of tax advantage investments or is part of it profitability related just give us the factors there michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah the biggest impact john on the tax rate relative to kind of the marginal rate that weve got is the impact we get from the tax credits we get on our low income housing and renewable energy investments and as you can see from the k disclosures those are those have been growing year after year and they grew we expect them to grow in as well and those are what they are right theres no those are pretty easy for us to identify and forecast and thats the biggest piece of whats bringing down the effective tax rate and those credits will continue obviously the more pretax income that we have above and beyond what we expect will sort of be at the marginal tax rate and so presumably if we obviously theoretically if we earn more money then youll see that effective tax rate sort of inch up over time john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then just on the mortgage outlook you mentioned charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey john this is charlie the only thing i would add on that is just mike you can correct me the reserve releases affect the rate but the size of our total tax number not that big again the substantial impact on the lower rate is the dollar benefit that we get from these tax advantaged investments that we have and as mike said just on income going forward think about it in terms of the marginal rate john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it so youre still expecting a singledigit tax rate this year mike correct michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah yeah no at this point thats the case john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then just to clarify on the mortgage outlook mike i think you said like the industry might be down in volume but you guys you expect to buck that a little bit because of some of the retail strength you have or were you kind of just saying that youll be down a little bit but still robust if you could just clarify your outlook on mortgage that would be great wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah look the industry data typically their forecasts lag a little bit relative to what the industry is actually seeing and so i think the industry is projecting that second quarter is going to be down a little bit but well see how that sort of plays out over the coming weeks in terms of what their forecasts are but i think based on what were seeing in our pipeline we feel like itll be a pretty robust quarter on the origination side youre likely to see that gain on sale margins come down but were likely to see an increase in volume as well john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi charlie mike thanks for taking my questions just a couple of cleanup ones just a little bit further on mortgage banking mike since you just answered that partly the question i have is ginnie mae buyouts you talked about that boosting your mortgage banking gains how much was that and because then that could give us a sense of what did your gain on sale margin do in  versus  and how much are you expecting that gain on sale margin im sorry the ginnie mae buyouts to continue in the next couple of quarters how much more to do michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i think vivek i dont have the number in front of me on the impact from the buyouts but i would also sort of point out so we can follow up with you after but i would also point out that the early buyouts as we resecuritized them that impacts sort of our balance as well sort of our loan balance in home lending and so i think thats another big driver and we give you some data in the qs in terms of what those balances look like quarterto quarter so we would expect that over the coming quarters that were going to continue to resecuritize more of those loans vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then a second one for both of you i saw the numbers on the expected gain on sale in the businesses well the asset management and corporate trust is that net of goodwill or is that do we need to adjust the goodwill writedown on that and thatll obviously play into your share buybacks and charlie given that were all anticipating the asset cap to be lifted at some point how are you thinking about the pace of share buybacks since thatll give you an opportunity to put some of that capital to work in terms of growing the balance sheet too dont worry im not trying to pin you down on timing of asset cap getting lifted but just michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah so vivek ill start there so i dont want to get wonky on accounting but the way we accounted for the student loan business was the sale of the portfolio and so there was a goodwill writedown that showed discretely in the pl and how that flows through as you sort of look at the corporate trust business sale and the wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 asset management sale you wont have a corresponding writedown of the goodwill the gains net of everything that goes into exiting there so you dont need to adjust for that i think as it comes to sort of the asset cap question well go back to our stock answer around not sort of not commenting on that at all other than the fact that as charlie has said a couple times on the call that were its our top priority and were continuing to do whatever we need to do to sort of work our way through that and we continue to believe were making good progress there and as you sort of look at our capital and liquidity levels weve got a significant continue to have a significant amount of excess capital so vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thanks operator our final question will come from the line of charles peabody with portales charles peabody q analyst portales partners yeah i had two questions one on cards and one on nii on the card front you mentioned that you were punching below your weight and just curious hearing from a lot of the card companies and jpmorgan this morning that theyre going to really accelerate their marketing spend on cards in the second half of the year so are you expecting to grow it how are you expecting to gain market share is it pricing awards how are you going to improve your relative position in that business charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure this is charlie thanks for the question first of all i would say again kind of like my comments on the corporate investment bank when we think about the opportunity were not talking about doing anything that is materially different from a risk perspective for the company the way we look at it is we have a business today which has 35ish billion of receivables when you look at the size of the consumer base that we touch across the franchise its hugely substantial and were hugely underpenetrated even though we do have a reasonable size business to start out with ultimately when you look at what we do as a card company the fact is our card propositions are not competitive what is available today in the marketplace or where people are going when we look at our things that we do on fraud when we look at our customer service every step of the way we think we have opportunities to make material improvements in what our offerings look like which will make our products far more attractive for those that currently have the products so that it becomes their primary product but also more attractive for the customers that we currently touch and so its a very very were very very clear about what we think weve got to do to increase that penetration in a lot of ways its very very basic because were building on something which is particularly uncompetitive which i just look at like it creates great opportunity for us charles peabody q analyst portales partners as a followup question on nii i believe you guys have modeled scenarios per negative rates at the short end can you share some of your findings on that wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah look negative rates in the short end wont have a significant impact on us at all i think we have the outlet at the fed at basis points and so i dont see that being an impact for us charles peabody q analyst portales partners thank you operator ill now turn the conference back over to management for any concluding remarks charles william scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co this is charlie again i just want to thank everyone for the time and we look forward to talking to you during the quarter and then on
