president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thanks john as usual ill make some brief comments about our second quarter results and update you on our priorities ill then turn the call over to mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions so let me start with some second quarter highlights our financial performance in the quarter benefited from our ongoing efforts to transform wells fargo we continued to generate strong feebased revenue growth with increases across most categories compared to a year ago due to both the investments were making in our businesses and favorable market conditions with particular strength in investment advisory trading activities and investment banking these results more than offset the expected decline in net interest income credit performance during the second quarter was consistent with our expectations consumers have benefited from the strong labor market and wage increases the performance of our consumer auto portfolio continued to improve reflecting prior credit tightening actions and we had net recoveries in our home lending portfolio while losses in our credit card portfolio increased as expected early delinquency performance of our recent vintages was aligned with expectations in our commercial portfolios losses continued to be driven by commercial real estate office properties where we expect losses to remain lumpy fundamentals in the institutional owned office real estate market continued to deteriorate as lower appraisals reflect the weak leasing market in many large metropolitan areas across the country however they still remain within the assumptions we made when setting our allowance for credit losses we continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives which has driven head count to decline for consecutive quarters average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the first quarter the higher interest rate environment and anticipation of rate cuts continued to result in tepid commercial loan demand and weve not changed our underwriting standards to chase growth balanced growth in our credit card portfolio was more than offset by declines across our other consumer portfolios average deposits grew modestly from the first quarter with higher balances in all of our consumerfacing lines of businesses now let me update you on our strategic priorities starting with our risk controller we are a different wells fargo from when i arrived our operational and compliance risk and control buildout is our top priority and will remain so until all deliverables are completed and we embed this mindset into our culture similar to the discipline we have for financial and credit risk today we continue to make progress by completing deliverables that are part of our plans the numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment while we see clear forward momentum its up to our regulators to make their own judgments and decide when the work is done to their satisfaction progress has not been easy but tens of thousands of my partners at wells fargo have now worked tirelessly for years to deliver the kind of change necessary for a company of our size and complexity and we will not rest until we satisfy the expectations of our regulators and the high standards we have set ourselves while we have made substantial changes and have meaningfully improved our control environment the industry operates in a heightened regulatory oversight environment and we remain at risk of further regulatory actions we are also a different wells fargo in how we are executing on other strategic priorities to better serve our customers and help drive higher returns over time let me highlight a few examples of the progress were making were diversifying revenue sources and reducing our reliance on net interest income we are improving our credit card platform with more competitive offerings which is important both for our customers and strategically for the company during the second quarter we launched two new credit cards a small business card and a consumer card since we have launched nine new credit cards and are almost complete in our initial product buildout the momentum in this business is demonstrated by continued strong credit card spend and new account growth wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 we are not lowering our credit standards but see that our strong brand and a great value proposition are being well received by the market building a larger credit card business is an investment as new products have significant upfront costs related to marketing promo rates onboarding and allowance which drive little profitability in early years but as long as our assumptions on spend balance growth and credit continue to play out as expected we expect the card business to meaningfully contribute to profit growth in the future as the portfolio matures weve have been methodically growing our corporate investment bank which has been a priority and continues to be a significant opportunity for us we are executing on a multiyear investment plan while maintaining our strong risk discipline and our positive momentum continues we have added significant talent over the past several years and will continue to do so in targeted areas where we see opportunities for growth fernando rivas recently joined wells fargo as coceo of corporate investment banking fernando has deep knowledge of our industry and his background and skills complement the terrific team jon weiss has put together while we view our work here as a longterm commitment we expect to see results in the short and mediumterm and are encouraged by the improved performance weve already seen with strong growth in investment banking fees during the first half of the year in our wealth and investment management business we have substantially improved advisor retention and have increased the focus on serving independent advisors and our consumer banking clients which should ultimately help drive growth in the commercial bank we are focused on growing our treasury management business adding bankers to cover segments where we are underpenetrated and delivering our investment banking and markets capabilities to clients and believe we have significant opportunities in the years ahead and we continue to see significant opportunities for our consumer small and business banking franchise to be a more important source of growth let me give you just a few examples of some of the things were doing here we continue to optimize and invest in our branch network while our branch count declined from a year ago we are being more strategic about branch location strategy we are accelerating our efforts to refurbish our branches completing during the first half of this year and are on track to update all of our branches within the next five years as part of our efforts to enhance the branch experience we are also increasing our investment in our branch employees and improving technology including a new digital account opening experience which has been a positive for both our bankers and our customers we continue to have strong growth in mobile users with active mobile customers up from a year ago a year after launching fargo our aipowered virtual assistance we have had nearly million users and over million interactions we expect this momentum to continue as we make further enhancements to offer our customers additional selfservice features and valueadded insights including balance trends and subscription spending looking ahead overall the us economy remains strong driven by a healthy labor market and solid growth however the economy is slowing and there are continued headwinds from still elevated inflation and elevated interest rates as managers of a large complex financial institution we think about both the risks and the opportunities and work to be prepared for the downside while continually building our ability to serve customers and clients the actions we have taken to strengthen the company have helped prepare us for a variety of economic environments and while risks exist we see significant opportunities in front of us our commitment and the progress we are making to build an appropriate operational and compliance risk management framework is foundational for our company and we will continue to prioritize and dedicate all necessary resources to complete our work we have a diversified business model see opportunities to build a broader earnings stream and are seeing the early progress in our results and weve maintained strong financial risk disciplines and a strong wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 balance sheet operating with a strong capital position in anticipation of the uncertainty the stress test regime imposes on large banks and the potential for increases to our regulatory capital requirement resulting from basel iii finalization has served us well it also allows us to serve our customers financial needs and we remain committed to prudently return excess capital to our shareholders as we previously announced we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by to per share subject to the approval by the companys board of directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month weve repurchased over billion of common stock during the first half of this year and while the pace will slow we have the capacity to continue repurchasing stock im proud of the progress we continue to make and thankful to everyone who works at wells fargo im excited about the opportunities ahead ill now turn the call over to mike michael p santomassimo chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co thank you charlie and good morning everyone net income for the second quarter was billion or per diluted common share eps grew from both the first quarter and a year ago reflecting the solid performance in our feebased businesses as we benefited from the market environment and the investments weve been making we also continue to focus on driving efficiency across the company i will also note that our second quarter effective income tax rate reflected the impact of the first quarter adoption of the new accounting standard for renewable energy tax credit investments which increased our effective tax rate by approximately percentage points versus a year ago this increase in the effective tax rate had a minimal impact on net income since it had an offsetting increase to noninterest income turning to slide as expected noninterest income was down net interest income was down billion or from a year ago this decline was driven by higher funding costs including the impact of lower deposit balances and customers migrating to higheryielding deposit products in our consumer businesses and higher deposit costs in our commercial businesses as well as lower loan balances this was partially offset by higher yields on earning assets net interest income declined million or from the first quarter given the higher rate environment and weak commercial loan demand loan balances continued to decline as expected we saw positive trends including average deposit balances growing from the first quarter with growth in all of our customerfacing businesses including within our consumer business customer migration to higheryielding alternatives was also lower in the quarter this slowed the pace of growth in deposit pricing with our average deposit cost up basis points from the second quarter after increasing basis points in the first quarter if the fed were to start cutting rates later this year we expect that deposit pricing would begin to decline with the most immediate impact in new promotional rates in our consumer business and standard pricing for commercial deposits where pricing moved faster as rates increased and we would expect ph business to also be higher as rates decline on slide we highlight loans and deposits average loans were down from both the first quarter and a year ago credit card loans continue to grow while most other categories declined ill highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results average deposits were relatively stable from a year ago as growth in our commercial businesses and corporate funding offset declines in our consumer businesses driven by customers migrating to higheryielding alternatives and continued consumer spending average deposits grew billion from the first quarter commercial deposits have grown for three consecutive quarters as we successfully ph attracted clients operational deposits after declining for nearly two years consumer deposit balances grew modestly from the first quarter wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 weve seen outflows slow as many rateseeking customers in wealth and investment management have already moved into cash alternative products and weve successfully used promotion and retentionoriented strategies to retain and acquire new balances in consumer small and business banking these improved deposit trends allowed us to reduce highercost market funding the migration from noninterest bearing to interest bearing deposits was similar to last quarter with our percentage of noninterest bearing deposits declining to in the first quarter to turning to noninterest income on slide noninterest income increased from a year ago with growth across most categories reflecting both the benefit of the investments weve been making in our businesses as well as the market conditions as charlie highlighted this growth more than offset the expected decline in net interest income with revenue increasing from a year ago the sixth consecutive quarter of yearoveryear revenue growth i will highlight the specific drivers of this growth when discussing our operating segment results turning to expenses on slide second quarter noninterest expense increased from a year ago driven by higher operating losses an increase in revenuerelated compensation and higher technology and equipment expense these increases were partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives including lower salaries expense and professional and outside services expense operating losses increased from a year ago and included higher customer remediation accruals for a small number of historical matters that we are working hard to get behind us the decline in noninterest expense from the first quarter was primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel expense in the first quarter turning to credit quality on slide net loan chargeoffs increased basis points from the first quarter to basis points of average loans the increase was driven by higher commercial net loan chargeoffs which were up million from the first quarter to basis points of average loans primarily reflecting higher losses in our commercial real estate office portfolio while losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio increased in the second quarter after declining last quarter they were in line with our expectations as we have previously stated commercial real estate office losses have been and will continue to be lumpy as we continue to work with clients we continue to actively work to derisk our office exposure including a rigorous monitoring process these efforts helped to reduce our office commitment by and loan balances by from a year ago consumer net loan chargeoffs increased million from the first quarter to basis points of average loans auto losses continue to decline benefiting from the credit tightening actions we implemented starting in late the increase in credit card losses was in line with our expectations as older vintages are no longer benefiting from pandemic stimulus and as more recent vintages mature importantly the credit performance of our newer vintages has been consistent with our expectations and we currently expect the credit card chargeoff rates to decline in the third quarter nonperforming assets increased from the first quarter driven by the higher commercial real estate office nonaccruals moving to slide our allowance for credit losses was down modestly from the first quarter driven by declines across most asset classes partially offset by a higher allowance for credit card loans driven by higher balances our allowance coverage for total loans has been relatively stable over the past four quarters as credit trends remain generally consistent our allowance coverage for our commercial real estate office portfolio has also been relatively stable at approximately for the past several quarters turning to capital and liquidity on slide our capital position remains strong and our cet1 ratio of continued to be well above our current regulatory minimum plus buffers were also above our expected new cet1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of starting in the fourth quarter of this year and our stress capital buffer is expected to increase from to we repurchased billion of common stock in the second quarter and while the pace will slow we have the capacity to continue to repurchase common stock as charlie wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 highlighted also we expect to increase our common stock dividend in the third quarter by subject to board approval turning to our operating segments starting with consumer banking and lending on slide consumer small and business banking revenue declined from a year ago driven by lower deposit balances and the impact of customers migrating to higheryielding deposit products home lending revenue was down from a year ago due to lower net interest income as loan balances continued to decline credit card revenue was stable from a year ago as higher loan balances driven by higher point of sale volumes and new account growth was offset by lower other fee revenue auto revenue declined from last year driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression personal lending revenue was down from a year ago driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression turning to some key business drivers on slide retail mortgage originations declined from a year ago reflecting our focus on simplifying the lending business as well as the decline in the mortgage market since we announced our new strategy at the start of we have reduced head count in home lending by approximately balances in our auto portfolio declined compared with a year ago driven by lower origination volumes which were down from a year ago reflecting previous credit tightening actions both debit and credit card spend increased from a year ago turning to commercial banking results on slide middle market banking revenue was down from a year ago driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit costs partially offset by growth in treasury management fees assetbased lending and leasing revenue decreased yearoveryear including lower net interest income lower lease income and revenue from equity investments average loan balances were down compared with a year ago loan demand has remained tepid reflecting the higher for longer rate environment and markets where competition has been more aggressive on pricing and loan structure turning to corporate and investment banking on slide banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products partially offset by lower treasury management results driven by the impact of higher interest rates on deposit accounts commercial real estate revenue was down from a year ago reflecting the impact of lower loan balances markets revenue grew from a year ago driven by strong performance in equities structured products and credit products average loans declined from a year ago as growth in markets was more than offset by reductions in commercial real estate where originations remain muted and weve strategically reduced balances in our office portfolio as well as declines in banking where clients continue to access capital markets funding on slide wealth and investment management revenue increased compared with a year ago higher assetbased fees driven by an increase in market valuations were partially offset by lower net interest income reflecting lower deposit balances and higher deposit costs as customers reallocated cash into higheryielding alternatives as a reminder the majority of wim advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter so third quarter results will reflect market valuations as of july which were up from both a year ago and from april slide highlights our corporate results revenue grew from a year ago due to improved results from our venture capital investments turning to our outlook for net interest income and noninterest expense on slide at the beginning of the year we expected net interest income to be approximately to lower than full year during the first half of this year the drivers of net interest income largely played out as expected with net interest income down from the same period a year ago compared with where we began the year our current outlook reflects the benefit of fewer rate cuts as well as higher deposit balances in our businesses than what we had assumed in our original expectations which has helped us reduce market funding deposit cost increased during the first half of this year as expected but the pace of the increase has slowed however late in the second quarter we increased pricing in wealth and investment management on sweep deposits in advisory brokerage wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 accounts this change was not anticipated in our original guidance better aligns rates with rates paid in money market funds and is expected to reduce net interest income by approximately million this year our current outlook also reflects lower loan balances at the beginning of the year we assumed a slight decline in average loans for the full year which reflected modest growth in commercial and credit card loans in the second half of the year after a slow start to the year as we highlighted on our first quarter earnings call loan balances were weaker than expected and that strength continued into the second quarter we expect this underperformance to continue into the second half of the year with loan balances declining slightly from second quarter levels as a result of these factors we currently expect our full year net interest income to be in the upper half of the range we provided in january or down approximately to from full year we continue to expect net interest income will trough towards the end of the year we are only halfway through the year and many of the factors driving net interest income are uncertain and we will continue to see how each of these assumptions plays out during the remainder of the year turning to expenses at the beginning of this year we expected our full year noninterest expense to be approximately billion we currently expect our full year noninterest expense to be approximately billion there are three primary drivers for this increase first the equity markets have outperformed our expectations driving higher revenue related compensation expense in wealth and investment management as a reminder this is a good thing as these higher expenses are more than offset by higher noninterest income second operating losses in the other customer remediation related expenses have been higher during the first half of the year than we expected as a reminder we have outstanding litigation regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year finally we did not anticipate the million of expense in the first half of the year for the fdic special assessment which is now included in our updated guidance well continue to update you as the year progresses in summary our results in the second quarter reflected the progress we are making to transform wells fargo and improve our financial performance our strong growth in feebased businesses offset the expected decline in net interest income we made further progress on our efficiency initiatives our capital position remains strong enabling us to return excess capital to shareholders and we continue to make progress on our path to a sustainable rotce of we will now the take your questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 question and answer section operator at this time we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions please stand by for our first question our first question will come from ken usdin of jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks a lot good morning mike i wonder if you could provide a little bit more detail on those latter points you made on the changes on the deposit cost side first of all i guess relative to the basis points that you saw in terms of interest bearing cost increase which was lower than the basis points how do you just generally expect that to look going forward and is that sweep pricing also a part of what that number will look like going forward thank you michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah thanks ken yes the sweep pricing will be included in that going forward you saw about basically about a months worth in the quarter we made the change in june so you saw about a third of a quarterly impact already included in the number look i think when you drill into whats going on in the deposit side id say a few things one overall were not seeing a lot of pressure on overall pricing in deposits on the consumer side this migration thats been happening now for a while from checking into savings or cds is still happening but at a slower pace and you can see that over the last couple years as its been pretty stable the last quarter or two but its definitely slowing as you look at the quarter and so id anticipate youd still see more migration but continuing to slow as we look forward on the wholesale side the pricings been pretty competitive now for a while and thats the case and so weve been pleased to see that were able to grow good operational deposits and so given the competitive pricing there that puts a little nearterm pressure on nii but those deposits are going to be very valuable over a long period of time particularly as rates start to come back down and so the positive i think overall as you saw deposits grow in every line of business for the first time in a long time and that migration is slowing to higher yielding alternatives and so well see how it plays out for the rest of the year but i think theres some good positive trends that are emerging there ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thank you and just a followup the fees were really good and the trading business continues to demonstrate that its taking market share i guess how do we understand how to kind of measure that going forward right versus what the groups doing you guys are definitely zigging and outperforming there where do you think you are in terms of market share gains and how sustainable do you think this new kind of run rate of trading is going forward thanks michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah ill take that and charlie can chime in if he wants as you look at trading in any given quarter its going to bounce around right so you cant necessarily straight line any single quarter so id be careful there as you look forward but i think the good part is like weve been methodically sort of making investments in really all the wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 asset classes fx credit a lesser degree in equities and other places but were getting the benefit of those investments each quarter on an incremental basis i think that business is still constrained by the asset cap and so we are not growing assets or financing clients assets at the same level we would be if we didnt have the asset cap which also then drives more trading flow as we go and so id say were still methodically sort of building it out and there should be opportunity for us to grow that in a prudent way for a while but any given quarter may bounce around a little bit depending on whats happening in the market or an asset class and were getting good reception from clients as we engage with them more and see them move more flow to us charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and this is charlie let me just add a couple of things which is as we think about the things that were doing to invest in our banking franchise both markets and the investment banking side of the franchise its not riskbased its actually its focused on customer flows on the trading side its focused on expanding coverage and improving product capabilities on the banking side so what we look at and were also very very focused on returns overall as you can imagine as all the other large financial institutions are so as were looking at our progress we do look at share across all the different categories and would expect to see those to continue to tick up and so as you look through the volatility that exists in the marketplace we are looking at a sustained level of growth recognizing that we dont control the quartertoquarter volatility ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you operator the next question will come from john pancari of evercore isi your line is open sir john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning you expressed confidence that nii should bottom towards the year end or towards the back half of this year maybe could you just give us what gives you the confidence in maintaining that view just given the loan growth dynamics that you mentioned and just mentioned the funding cost and the rate backdrop if you could just kind of walk us through your confidence in that inflection and i guess what it could mean as you go into thanks michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah we wont talk much about john but as you sort of look at whats happening youre seeing this pace of migration on the deposit side flow as i mentioned earlier so youre seeing more stability as time goes by there once the fed starts lowering rates which the market expects to happen later in the year youll start to see betas on the way down on the wholesale side of the deposit base youll continue to see some gradual sort of repricing on the asset side as you see more securities and more loans sort of roll and so youve got to exactly calling sort of the trough is which quarter its going to be sometimes can be a little tough but as you sort of look at all the components of it we still feel pretty good about being able to see that happen over the coming few quarters wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks mike and if i could just hop over to capital buybacks i mean you bought back about billion this quarter similar to the first quarter you indicated the pace will slow maybe could you give us a little bit of color on how we should think about that moderation and how long that could persist at this point and how long until you could be back at the run rate you were previously charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah let me take a shot at it mike and then you can add the color on this one listen i think when you look at where weve been running capital weve been trying to anticipate as i mentioned in my prepared remarks the uncertainties that exist around the way we find out about scb as well as the uncertainty that exists with where basel iii ultimately comes out the reality of those two things are we know where the scb is for this year at this point we still dont know where basel iii ultimately winds up so i think as we sit here today we will continue well be conservative on capital return in the shorterterm until we learn more about exactly where basel iii will ultimately wind up and then we can get more specific about what that means for capital returns so i just i think were just trying to be very pragmatic the reality is were still generating a significant amount of capital and a reasonablysized dividend thats increased as our earnings power has increased given the fact that we have constraints most of what the remainder of our capital generation goes towards capital return but we want to see where basel iii ultimately winds up john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you operator the next question will come from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open sir ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning just maybe one followup first mike and charlie on capital is a line in the sand right now as you wait for basel and clarity there as we at least youre not guiding for it but as we think about what the pace of buybacks might be or could cet1 go below still significant buffer with the minimum would appreciate how you think about that ratio in the context of capital return charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i think where we are plus a little bit probably not minus a little bit but plus some is probably the right place to be at this point remember the scb was higher than we expected and so thats factoring into our thinking and so thats really whats driving our thinking in terms of slowing the pace of buybacks at this point but again hopefully well get some more clarity on basel iii we know what you know and then well be much clearer about what we think the future looks like there but again overall we still have the capacity to buy back we just as weve always been we want to be prudent ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 understood and then just moving to expenses so i get the guide the expense guide increased but remind us has anything changed maybe charlie from you first on the expense flex thats a big part of the wealth thesis around efficiency gains which should lead to the path for that rotce and what are you baking in in terms of the fee revenue for the back half as part of that guide like does it assume elevated levels of trading in ib thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co let me just take the first part i appreciate you asking the question i think from as we look forward nothing has changed for us as we think about the opportunity to continue to become more efficient that story is no different today than it was yesterday or last quarter as we increased the estimates for the year its really reflective of three broad categories one are the variable expenses that relate to our wealth and investment management business where we have higher revenues that results in a higher payout and as mike always points out thats actually a good thing even though its embedded in the expense line which causes that number to head upwards the second thing are the fact that weve had higher customer remediations and fdic expenses in the first half of the year than when we contemplated the expense guidance on the customer remediations weve said theyre not new items theyre historical items were getting closer to the end of finalization in these things and as that occurs things like response rates and making sure that weve identified the full amount of the population gets all finetuned and thats whats flowing through but thats a it really relates to historical matters and not something thats embedded in what we see in the business going forward so what youre left with is the rest of the earnings im sorry the expense base of the company and its playing out as we would have expected and so as we sit here and look forward all the statements ive made in the past are still true which is were not as efficient as we need to be were focused on investing in growing the business were focused on spending whats necessary to build the right risk and control infrastructure and were focused on driving efficiency out of the company and that lever is as continues to be exactly what its been ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and you assume fees staying elevated in the back half as part of the guidance michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah we assume equity markets are about where they are today so still staying pretty elevated ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc noted thank you so much operator the next question will come from erika najarian of ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 hi good morning first i just want to be put context to this question because i didnt want to ask it just in isolation because it seems tickytacky but its not so the stock is down and if i just take consensus to the higher end of your nii range to that would imply that consensus would address in isolation so this is just a context of why im asking this question on expenses so your expenses went up in terms of from your original guide billion i guess you laid out those three bullets and you quantified fdic special assessment i guess im just wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on how much more the remediation expenses and op losses were up versus your original expectation because i think what the market wants to understand is nii okay we get it thats happening because of deposit rate pricing but is core ppnr outside of that going up right just sort of want to have that assurance in terms of is the eps going to be down as much coming out of this as the market is indicating michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah no erika its mike i appreciate the question we give you the operating loss line in the supplement so you can see that and if you based on what we had said in january if you assume that the billion on a full year basis was just split evenly across all the quarters you can see that the operating losses are up about million yeartodate over that run rate so thats the way to think about approximately what the impact of that is yearto date in the first half charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co so then you take that you add the fdic to it michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co right and the remainder is roughly the revenuerelated expenses in wealth management charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co so thats why erika when i was talking before when you look at whats driving the increase in the expense guide its remediations in the first and second quarter its the fdic expense that youve seen and its the increase in variable expenses everything else is playing out as we would have expected erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay that makes sense and just maybe some comments on how youre thinking about credit quality from here it looks like you continued to release reserves in the second quarter is this a message that you feel like youve captured most of the crerelated issues of course absent of a further deterioration in the economy and how should we think about the trajectory of the reserves from here relative to your chargeoffs michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co well when you say well i think when we look at the reserves you have to bucket into different pieces our exposures are coming down in parts of the consumer business and our based on underwriting changes weve wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 made its not just balances but also the actual losses so thats whats driving the reductions in that part of the loss reserves on the consumer side and on the credit card side its really driven the increase is really driven by balances so youve got two very different dynamics going on there with the releases being just representative of a smaller higher credit quality credit portfolio and then on the wholesale side the losses that weve seen and the credit performance in our cib office cre portfolio is playing out no worse than we would have expected when we set our acl but theres still uncertainty there so were maintaining the coverage so overall theres really in terms of our expectations no real change from what were seeing in the cre portfolio which is where the loss content is actually coming through and elsewhere things are still fairly benign other than some episodic credit events in part of the wholesale business but no real trend there erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc great thank you charlie and mike operator the next question will come from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open sir matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning can you just elaborate a bit on why you increased the deposit cost for wells was it to keep up with competition was it trying to get ahead of some potential repricing pressures or what was kind of the logic there michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah hey its mike matt so this was very specific to a sweep product in the wealth business so its a portion of that overall deposits and it doesnt have any bearing on any other product i would just leave it at that very specific to that one individual product in fiduciary accounts or advisory accounts matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and how big is that those deposit balances michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co we dont thats not something we normally have out there but you can see the impact is i sort of highlighted the impact is roughly million for the rest of the year for the second half of the year so i would just use that as and thats already embedded in sort of the guidance we gave matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just separate topic here the credit card growth has been very good you highlighted rolling out some new products and the question is always indiscernible in certain categories indiscernible growing too quickly the loss rates have gone up maybe a little more than some peers not as much as some others obviously in line with what you were targeting there was that negative wall street journal wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 article on one of your cards so just kind of taken together what kind of checks and balances do you have to make sure that a somewhat new initiative for you that youre growing at the right pace thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah so mike ill start and then you can chime in so first of all when we look at our credit card performance we do not look at it in total we look at each individual product we look at all of the performance broken out by vintage and we compare the results that were seeing both in terms of balance build as well as credit performance not losses but starting very early with early on books delinquencies and we look at how theyre playing out versus prepandemic results as well as what we would have anticipated when we launched the product as ive said we look at the actual quality of the consumers that were underwriting and the overall credit quality we havent compromised credit quality at all weve probably tightened up a little bit as time has gone on relative to where we had been but the actual performance when you look at the vintages is its really spoton with what we would have expected so what youre seeing in terms of the increase in loss rates is just the maturing of the portfolio and the last thing ill just say is just when you think about the wall street journal articles weve launched a lot a bunch of new credit cards that is a relative to the size and the scope of all of the cards take that we issue and what our strategy is thats a very very very small piece of it michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah and ill just add one piece as you look at new account growth were not originating anything less than so as charlie mentioned some of the credit tightening fico so as charlie mentioned the credit box has not been broadened really at all and when you look at some of the bigger products like cash back like the cash back card active cash the new originations are coming in at higher credit quality than the back book was and so at this point as charlie said we go through it at a very very granular level each quarter and results are kind of right where we expect and if we start to see any kind of weakness at all were adjusting where needed charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and just one last comment here which is again because i appreciate the question whenever you see a lot of growth in a product that has risk in it its always the right thing to ask the questions were not this isnt the people that are doing this both in our card business who runs consumer lending myself this is not a new product for us weve seen this happen in the past weve seen people do this well and weve soon people not do this well and so were very very conscious of the risks that youre pointing out as we go forward just as we are on the other businesses that were investing in matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and obviously you talked about card losses going down in so thats consistent with everything you said as well so thank you for the color charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yep wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co absolutely operator the next question will come from betsy graseck of morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so just wanted to make sure on the expense guide i get the point that a bunch of that is related to better revenues from wealth management and so we should be anticipating as a part of that that revenues for wealth management in the second half is going to be at least at one half or maybe even a little higher is that fair charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i mean betsy i covered that in my script too so as you look at the advisory assets there they get price based most of them get priced in advance for the quarter so you know what third quarter looks like based on where we are now and obviously its not all equity market theres fixed income in there as well but you should see a little bit of an increase as you go into the third quarter based on where the markets are now and then well see what the fourth quarter looks like when we get there betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay so just wanted to make sure we balanced out the expenses with the rev beat that i know youre not guiding revs up but interpretation leads you down that path and so then i guess the other piece of the question i just had to relate with the loan balance discussion that was going on earlier and whats your view of interest in leaning into the markets business today i realize theres opportunity theres still the asset cap constraint but youre not at the asset cap so there is room for you to lean in there are players who are a little bit more constrained on capital than you even in that space so is this an area that you would be interested in leaning into especially when ci and cre and other types of loans are low demand right now as you indicated earlier thanks charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well let me start i think so first of all relative to where the balance sheet is running were not we want to were careful about how we run the overall balance sheet right which is we dont want to operate at the cap on a regular basis because youve got to be prepared both for customer appetite in terms of lending and deposits when you see it as well as we lived through covid where there was an event and all of a sudden there were a bunch of wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 draws and we have to live within that asset cap so running it with a cushion is a very smart thing we think for us to do even though you can argue were giving up some shorterterm profit so thats just the reality of where we live and so as we think about the markets business and what that means in a perfect world wed be allowing them to finance some more there are more opportunities out there for us to be able to do that but what we are doing is as we think about inside the company optimizing the balance sheet and where we get the most returns and where theres more demand than less demand there has been less demand in other parts of the company and theres been more demand on the trading side so our assets are actually up 15ish percent michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah trading if you go to the supplement betsy trading assets on an average basis are up a little more on a spot basis charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co so were just trying so were reflective of what those opportunities are but weve got to keep capacity for the reasons i mentioned betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thank you operator the next question will come from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning charlie good morning mike charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc charlie you mentioned in your opening comments about fargo you guys launched fargo over a year ago i guess and youre having real good pickup can you share with us any other aiorientated programs that are in workinprogress right now that could lead to increased efficiencies or cost savings or even revenue enhancements as you go forward charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure when we think about ai we do break it into different categories right theres traditional ai and then theres gen ai we have a huge number of use cases already embedded across the company with just traditional ai and that is its in marketing its in credit decisioning its in information that we provide bankers on both the wholesale and the consumer side about what customers could be willing or might be willing to entertain a wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 discussion about and so that is in a lot of respects thats business as usual for us the new opportunity that exists with gen ai is where ai creates something based upon whether its public data or our own data in terms of things that havent existed we are most focused in the shorterterm on things that can drive efficiency but it also contributes to just quality of the experience for our customers so great examples of things like that are call centers we take lots of phone calls and weve got lots of opportunities through ai to answer those questions before someone gets to a call center rep but once they get to a call center rep we put a lot of effort into answering that question correctly but also making sure that were capturing that information understanding root cause across all these calls we get that means bankers have to go telephone bankers have to go in actually enter what the call was about what they think the root cause is we then have to aggregate that and so on and so forth through gen ai that can be done automatically it could be done immediately and the work can be done for us to identify that root cause so then we can go back look at it make sure thats the case and make the change so ultimately that results in fixing defects going forward but it also takes so much manual effort out of what we do so any place where something is written something is analyzed by an individual weve got the opportunity to automate that those things exist on the wholesale side as well as the consumer side to the extent that they impact a consumer were going to move very slowly to make sure we understand the impact of that and so the work is a meaningful part of as we think about prioritization in terms of our tech spend gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good i appreciate those insights and then just as a quick followup you also mentioned about improved advisor retention in the quarter and when you look at your wealth and investment management segment i recognize commissions and brokerage service fees are not the main driver investment advisory and other asset based fees are in revenues for this division but i noticed that theyve been flat to down this year and they were up over a year ago is it seasonal in the second quarter that that line of business just gets soft or is it the higher rate environment where customers are just leaving more cash in more assets in cash because theyre getting or so michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah there really is no rhyme or reason necessarily gerard to exactly how that moves one quarter to the next necessarily obviously if theres like large bouts of volatility you might see more transaction activity that certainly hasnt been the case necessarily in the equity market in the second quarter but to some degree as that line item over a very long period of time that line item probably declines more and advisory goes up and thats actually a really good thing from a productivity and from an ongoing revenue perspective as well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay super okay appreciate it thank you mike operator and our final question for today will come from steven chubak of wolfe research your line is open sir steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 thanks good morning charlie good morning mike just given the sheer amount of i guess investor questions that we received on the deposit pricing changes in wealth i was hoping you could provide some additional context given many of your peers have talked about cash sorting pressures abating or at least being in the very late innings and want to better understand what informed the decision to adjust your pricing was it impacting advisor recruitment or retention was it impeding your ability to retain more share of wallet and or is this an effort to maybe go on the offensive and lead the market on pricing in sweep deposits and force others to potentially follow suit michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah steve its mike id say just a couple things one this is not in reaction to cash sorting we are seeing cash sorting slow in the wealth business just like were seeing that in the consumer business so this is not a reaction to that in any way its a relatively small portion of the overall deposits that sit within the wealth business and it is very specific to this product which is in an advisory account where theres frictional cash there so its not a reaction to competitive forces that were seeing or us trying to be proactive somewhere to drive growth steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc understood and just one followup on the discussion relating to expenses and just given the fee momentum that youre seeing within cib and wealth and youre clearly making investments in both of those segments at the same time the incremental margins have actually been quite high especially in cib where its running north of just first half this year versus last i was hoping to get some perspective as we think about some of that fee momentum being sustained what do you believe are sustainable or durable incremental margins within cib and wealth recognizing the payout profiles are different michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co well let me start on the wealth side and ill come back to the ib banking or banking side so on the wealth side whats really going to help us drive margin expansion in that business over time are really kind of two things one is continued productivity and growth in the advisory asset side which you can see happening and then two and weve talked about this in other forums its doing a much better job penetrating that client base with banking and lending products and when you look at our loans in the wealth business and you look at the overall asset base or the advisor for us were much less penetrated than some of the peers and so i think those things really help drive us to get to more bestinclass margins which are higher than where we sit today and that takes some time on the lending side in this rate environment its a little harder to drive that growth and as rates start to come down youll probably see more demand there and so there are some cyclical aspects of it that sort of come to from a timing perspective but those are things that barry sommers and the whole management team in wealth are very focused on and making sure weve got the right capabilities the right sales force the right support for the salesforce and so forth on the ibanking side weve been making investments in that business now for the better part of twoplus years a little longer than that probably and as were adding good people were also making sure that weve got the right people in the right seats and so youre not seeing this really huge increase in overall senior head count youre actually were making sure we have the right people in the right seats and so youve seen some reductions as youve seen some growth and so thats helping also moderate the overall investment and then also as weve brought those people on youre paying them full freight when you recruit people right wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 so what youre seeing is youre getting the benefit of those investments by adding the revenue piece now but youve already got the expense in the run rate to some degree and so i think youll see that pace of margin expansion moderate over time but what youre seeing is what you should expect which is like we made the investments youre paying the people now theyre becoming productive incrementally each quarter and thats good to see steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats really helpful color mike thanks for taking my questions michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah charles
