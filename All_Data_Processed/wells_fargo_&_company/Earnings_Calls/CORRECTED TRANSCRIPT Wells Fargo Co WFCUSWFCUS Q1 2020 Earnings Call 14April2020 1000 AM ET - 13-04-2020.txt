actions were taking our business performance and ongoing work to transform the company then john will provide more details on the first quarter results before we take your questions let me start with some remarks about the current environment i first want to start by saying that our thoughts are with those directly impacted by covid19 this includes those who have contracted the virus healthcare workers who are on the frontlines helping those directly impacted and all of those who provide essential services to ensure the country continues to function as difficult as this is the response by government companies and individuals has been extraordinary we understand wells fargo plays an important role in providing stability to the financial system and the economy more broadly and while theres still much to do im incredibly proud of the efforts across the entire company particularly those on the frontlines let me start by discussing what wells fargo has done first ill start with our customers weve been aggressive in our actions to ensure we can best serve customers while also prioritizing employee and customer safety first on access we temporarily closed approximately branches which is about onefourth of our network nationwide choosing locations to close is based on the historical branch traffic and the physical design of each branch that would allow appropriate social distancing consumer and small business contact centers remain open wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 in all other us locations to serve our customers but wait times are higher and weve deployed social distancing and safety measures in all sites to ensure we keep our employees safe weve been rapidly expanding digital access and deploying new tools including air limits for mobile deposits and wires new digital mortgage deferment tools and expanded esignature support customers are adopting these new tools as demonstrated by a increase in dollar volume of mobile deposits in march versus march were providing significant credit to our clients in the month of march alone our commercial customers utilized over billion of their loan commitments and were providing accommodations for clients in need through april we helped more than million consumers and small business customers by deferring payments and waiving fees we deferred over million payments representing almost billion of principal and interest payments and provided over fee waivers exceeding million weve suspended residential property foreclosure sales evictions and involuntary auto repossessions and we continue to work with hud the gses our trade groups others in the industry as well as government officials and notforprofits to identify other ways to assist customers facing financial challenges in the current environment weve expanded our participation in the ppp program and hope to provide significant relief to our small business customers were quickly ramping up our processing capacity to respond to the significant demand weve seen through april weve received more than indications of interest from our customers we are working with industry groups and the us treasury in preparation to distribute millions of economic impact payments to americans as quickly as possible for those that receive checks weve implemented changes to our atms and mobile app to make it more convenient to use those depository options instead of going into a branch now turning to how were operating the company and our employees weve enabled approximately employees to work remotely for jobs that cannot be done from home in addition to modifying branch formats weve taken significant actions to ensure safety including enhancing social distancing measures staggering staff and shifts and implementing an enhanced cleaning program we continue to pay all employees weve made a onetime cash award to approximately employees who make less than additionally as a way of recognizing the unique contributions of our employees that work on the frontline were making additional payments to those employees weve made changes to our benefit plan to support those who are being tested or those who have the virus to assist our employees who need childcare we granted eligible employees up to five paid business days off so they can find childcare were also providing financial support to eligible employees for those seeking childcare through their own personal networks and we made a million grant to the we care employee relief fund which is available to employees affected by coronavirus especially those with limited resources to help them get back on their feet with basic necessities and were supporting our communities by directing million in charitable donations from the wells fargo foundation to help address food shelter small business and housing stability as well as providing help to public health organizations fighting to contain the spread of covid19 turning to what weve seen over the last month in the markets as you all know the health crisis has had a swift and severe impact on the financial markets but the banks including wells fargo are financially strong and have done a great job as many other industries have in providing continued service while many of our employees have been unable to access their offices we also have navigated huge disruptions we saw in liquidity in most asset wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 classes for several weeks hqla bidask spreads daily volatility and credit spreads increased to versus normalized levels prior to crisis activity remained reasonably order at hqla other loss remote credit assets and high quality corporate primary issuance but most other markets saw forced selling high intraday volatility and bidasks widening meaningfully fed programs designed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy immediately improved risk pricing increased dealer balance sheet capacity decreased market volatility and lower transaction costs large scale asset purchases in treasuries and agency mbs improved secondary trading flows in hqla while creditsensitive assets lagged the recovery all of this as well as the effective shutdown of the economy directly impacted our results turning to the quarter you can see that results were materially impacted by loan loss reserves impairment of securities and redemption of preferred securities our results included a reserve build of billion for loans and debt securities million of securities impairment predominantly related to equity securities and a negative impact related to the redemption of our series k preferred stock within our community bank as would be expected branch traffic significantly slowed as march progressed we had approximately half the teller volume at the end of march compared with the same period a year ago atm transactions were also down significantly down approximately in march compared to a year ago on the lending side we originated billion of residential mortgage loans for refinancing auto originations declined from the fourth quarter with strong originations early in the quarter more than offset by a slowdown in march credit card purchase volume was down from the fourth quarter and down from the year ago as strong volume early in the quarter was more than offset by declines in march within wealth and investment management periodend deposit balances increased during the quarter driven by higher retail brokerage sweeps reflecting higher client cash allocations retail brokerage transaction revenue increased from the prior quarter and despite market declines wells fargo asset management aum still grew during the quarter driven by strong inflows into money market products ill turn to our wholesale businesses now in trading markets businesses were up nicely yearoveryear in the first two months of the quarter but performance was mixed in march we had strong performance in macro trading as well as in equities due to volatility and increased flows however our performance in spread products suffered due to the market dislocation commercial loans grew billion or from the fourth quarter and overall global debt capital markets activity was the strongest on record driven by highgrade offerings from us issuers whose volumes were up compared to a year ago wells fargos highgrade debt capital markets lead table rankings improved from fourth to third with fee based market share during the quarter while focused on our efforts around covid we continue to make significant changes inside the company we continue to add talent to the senior leadership team ellen patterson joined us several weeks ago as our general counsel and we expect several more additions to the team in the coming quarter even with the significant amount of time being devoted to our covid response were not reducing our efforts on our regulatory commitments and we continue to move forward on improving the processes structure and cultural wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 change necessary to get the work done as a reminder during the quarter we announced new organizational structure with five lines of business reporting directly to me ive also spoken of our business reviews weve had put in place those agendas have changed and are now oriented towards issues related to operating in the current stressed environment as we settle into this environment and have some line of sight to recovery we will reengage with the work i discussed last quarter let me turn to the asset cap now john will provide more details on how were managing in this environment given the constraints but here are some highlights were focused on doing all we can for our clients while satisfying the requirements and to do this we make decisions each day on balance sheet allocation as a reminder the asset cap is measured on a twoquarter daily average basis and must be below trillion at the end of the quarter on march that calculation was an estimated trillion in midmarch as the crisis began to evolve we first saw slow increases in deposits and drawdowns in committed lending facilities and both of those accelerated as the crisis deepened at the end of the quarter we had trillion in assets john will discuss this in more detail but were taking a number of actions to ensure we stay below the cap we started the quarter with a strong capital position including a cet1 ratio of with the strong growth in assets during the quarter materially wider spreads as well as lower earnings our cet1 ratio declined to still above the regulatory minimum of and our current internal target of as you know we suspended our share buyback as we focus on helping our customers get through these challenging times im sure you will want to discuss our capital plans going forward but as you know we submitted our capital plan earlier this month and the results will be published by the federal reserve board in june as i think about what the future holds here are a few thoughts weve entered into a world we havent seen before much of the economy is essentially closed consumer spend is down over yearoveryear this past week with food and drug increasing and other spend down significantly new auto sales in the month of march were down in february manufacturing has turned downward with ism march reading of as businesses cut back on orders commodity prices are down speaking to the weakness in global demand unemployment has grown beyond what weve traditionally modeled and while there is hope that this is time bound by shelterinplace orders we dont know what the timeframe is or how quickly the economy will recover when these orders are lifted what we do know is the contraction is real and we must do all we can to be safe and to ensure we do our part to help recover as quickly as possible its equally important to note the response is also beyond what weve historically seen banks have provided significant amounts of credit liquidity banks have deferred payments on loans waived fees made numerous other accommodations for customers in need the response from the federal reserve has been fast comprehensive in scope and significant in size and the response of congress has been equally impressive and their actions are just beginning to provide the support necessary for many but will unfold quickly the question remains what this means for our future whats important is controlling the spread of the virus so the economy can reopen were hopeful that our actions those of others and especially government support should provide needed relief and help many customers bridge this difficult period but the length of the shutdown will ultimately determine the severity what we do know is our strong levels of capital and liquidity position enable us to support our customers and the wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 broader us economy we will be closely evaluating our assumptions regarding our allowance for credit losses as we move forward and the actual level of losses we incur will be driven by how long this period lasts and the effectiveness of the support from government and private industry sitting here today there are many unknowns and the year will look quite different than we expected the last time we spoke but as i said were focused on delivering for our customers and communities to get through these unprecedented times and we remain committed to the financial and performance improvements weve discussed as we get beyond this crisis thanks again to all my partners at wells fargo that have been working tirelessly and ill pass it on to john john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thanks charlie good morning everyone charlie covered the information provided in the initial pages of the supplement related to the actions were taking to support our customers employees and communities during the pandemic so im going to start on page as we highlight on this page we had a number of significant items in the first quarter that impacted our results we had billion of provision expense for credit losses reflecting the expected impact these unprecedented times could have on our customers credit worthiness we had million of securities impairment predominantly related to equity securities reflecting lower market valuations while deferred compensation plan investment results did not meaningfully impact the bottom line they increased net losses from equity securities by million and reduced employee benefits expense by million we had million of operating losses which were down billion from the fourth quarter that included elevated litigation accruals we had a million gain on the sale of residential mortgage loans which had previously been designated as heldforsale mortgage banking income declined million from the fourth quarter driven by marktomarket losses on loans heldforsale and higher msr asset valuation losses as a result of assumption updates primarily prepayment estimates finally we redeemed our series k preferred stock which reduced eps by per share as a result of the elimination of the purchase accounting discount recorded on these shares at the time of the wachovia acquisition even after factoring in the covid19related impacts experienced during the first quarter as we highlight on page our cet1 ratio remained basis points above the regulatory minimum and our lcr ratio was above the regulatory minimum these surpluses are noteworthy given the regulatory minimums theyre based upon are established to ensure financial institutions maintain sufficient resources to withstand severely adverse economic and market conditions turning to page ill be covering the income statement drivers throughout the call but i wanted to highlight that our effective income tax rate was in the first quarter and included net discrete income tax expense of million ill be highlighting most of the balance sheet drivers on page throughout the call but i will note here that the economic environment our customers are facing due to covid19 caused our balance sheet to expand as loan demand and deposit inflows increased significantly late in the first quarter wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 on page we highlight how were helping our customers while managing under the asset cap thats been in place since early driven by strong loan growth in march our total assets grew billion from yearend to trillion as charlie highlighted even with this growth we continue to operate in compliance with the asset cap of trillion as compliance is measured at each quarter end based on a twoquarter daily average as of march the twoquarter daily average for our assets was trillion during these challenging times we expect loan and deposit growth could continue but cannot provide guidance on the level of growth and were actively working to create balance sheet capacity to help our customers its worth noting that the high rate of growth at line utilization by our commercial clients has backed off since credit markets have reopened we appreciate the targeted action the federal reserve took last week which will provide additional flexibility for us to make small business loans as part of the paycheck protection program and the forthcoming main street business lending program we have and will continue to take actions to manage the size of our balance sheet for example weve exited correspondent nonconforming mortgage originations which gives us the ability to better meet the mortgage financing needs of our existing customers and similar to the actions we took in early were reducing low liquidity value deposits particularly deposits from other financial institutions and weve also reduced our securities finance footprint lets look at the drivers of the balance sheet growth we had in the first quarter starting with average loans on page average loans increased billion from the fourth quarter driven by commercial loans given the significant growth that occurred late in the quarter related to a change in borrowing behavior caused by the covid19 pandemic im going to spend more time describing periodend trends starting on page periodend loans increased billion or from a year ago and billion or from the fourth quarter commercial loans grew billion or from the fourth quarter as balance sheet declines early in the first quarter were more than offset by strong growth late in the quarter the growth in commercial loans in the first quarter included more than billion of borrower draw activity in the month of march on commercial banking and corporate investment banking sic corporate investment banking loans revolving loan utilization in wholesale banking was in march up basis points from december and as i mentioned during the first two weeks of april weve seen these draws slow consumer loans were down billion or from the fourth quarter as declines in credit card loans consumer real estate loans and other revolving loans were partially offset by growth in auto loans ill highlight the drivers of the linkedquarter trends in more detail starting on page the first mortgage loan portfolio decreased million from the prior quarter as refinancingled paydowns more than offset billion of heldforinvestment mortgage loan originations junior lien mortgage loans were down million from the fourth quarter as continued paydowns more than offset new originations and billion of draws on existing lines which was up meaningfully late in the first quarter credit card loans declined billion from the fourth quarter driven by seasonality and fewer new account openings our auto portfolio continued to grow while we maintained our credit discipline with balances up wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 million from the fourth quarter however as charlie highlighted originations declined from the fourth quarter with strong originations early in first quarter more than offset by a slowdown in march due to the pandemic turning to commercial loans on page ci loans were up billion from the fourth quarter with broadbased growth across business lines largely driven by draws of revolving lines as clients reacted to the economic slowdown associated with the pandemic commercial real estate loans were up billion from the fourth quarter with growth in both cre mortgage and construction loans given the focus on commercial loan draws and exposure to industries that had been particularly hard hit as a result of the pandemic were providing more details on certain of our industry exposures starting on page we typically disclose the industry breakdown of our ci and lease financing portfolio in our quarterly sec filings but are also providing the industry breakdown of our total commitments on this slide id note that not all unfunded loan commitments are unilaterally exercisable by borrowers for example certain revolvers contain features that require the customer to post additional collateral in order to access the full amount of the commitment while many areas of the economy are being impacted by the pandemic the next few slides provide details on the industries with escalated monitoring starting with oil and gas on page as of march we had billion of loans outstanding to the oil and gas industry the size of our portfolio was down from billion in the first quarter of which was also when oil prices were low as of the end of the first quarter of our portfolio were loans to the exploration and production sector to midstream and to services ill provide more detail on the performance of this portfolio later on the call we had billion of retail loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter which included billion to restaurants this includes billion to limited service restaurants commonly referred to as fast food restaurants typically with a drivethru which have largely remained open across the country while other restaurant formats have been more impacted with service limited to delivery or pickup turning to the entertainment and recreation industry on slide we had a total of billion of loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter with less than to cruise lines we had billion of loans outstanding to the transportation industry as of march which included billion to air transportation were also closely monitoring our commercial real estate portfolio which we highlight on slide at the end of the first quarter we had billion of loans outstanding to retail excluding shopping centers within the commercial real estate mortgage portfolio and billion in loans outstanding to the hotelmotel industry within our billion construction portfolio we had billion of loans outstanding in apartments turning to deposits on page average deposits increased from a year ago and from the fourth quarter typically we experience linkedquarter seasonal declines in average deposits in our wholesale banking and wim businesses but all of our deposit gathering businesses grew in the first quarter this growth included the late quarter impacts of flighttoquality deposits across all business lines following the emergence of covid19 as well as the inflow of deposits associated with corporate and commercial loan draws our average deposit cost declined basis points from the fourth quarter with declines across all of our lines of business we had larger declines in wholesale banking and wim while our retail banking deposit costs declined at a slower pace as they were lower to begin with and continue to be impacted from promotional pricing in early most of which will expire in the second quarter wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 on page we provide details on periodend deposits which better reflect the strong growth we had at the end of the first quarter with total deposits up billion or from yearend wholesale banking deposits were up billion from the fourth quarter driven by commercial banking and commercial real estate revolving line draws partially offset by lower financial institutions deposits reflecting actions taken to manage the asset gap consumer and small business banking deposits increased billion or from the fourth quarter including higher retail banking deposits largely driven by growth in high yield savings and interestbearing checking wealth and investment management deposit growth was driven by higher cash balances from brokerage clients net interest income increased million from the fourth quarter reflecting million higher hedge ineffectiveness accounting results attributable to the level of market rates and differences in basis and notional on swaps hedging our longterm debt84 million of lower mbs premium amortization resulting from lower realized prepays partially offset by balance sheet repricing including the impact of the lower interest rate environment as our assets reprice down faster than our liabilities and from one fewer day in the quarter the low rate environment could continue to put pressure on our net interest income but were managing our interest rate exposure to minimize the impact as much as possible given the current market volatility and uncertainty were withdrawing our prior net interest income guidance while were currently not providing guidance on our expectations for net interest income for this year we will provide more insights regarding developments throughout the year turning to page noninterest income declined billion from the fourth quarter driven by a billion decline in net gains from equity securities and million of lower mortgage banking income let we explain these declines in more detail starting with mortgage banking lower mortgage banking income reflected unrealized losses of approximately million on residential loans and million on commercial loans heldforsale due to illiquid market conditions and the widening of credit spreads this impact is recorded in net gain on mortgage loan originations and the million loss reduced the production margin we report on residential heldforsale originations absent this impact our production margin would have increased as origination demand exceeded capacity during the first quarter mortgage banking results also reflected million of higher losses on the valuation of our msr asset as a result of assumption updates primarily prepayment estimates i would note that we ended the first quarter with a billion mortgage loan application pipeline which was up billion or from the fourth quarter we provide details on the net losses from equity securities on page we had billion of net losses from equity securities in the quarter which included million of largely plneutral deferred comp plan investment losses net losses from equity securities also included million of impairments reflecting lower market valuation the impairments on venture capital private equity and certain wholesale businesses represented of the carrying values of these businesses portfolio investments subject to the impairment assessment turning to expenses on page our expenses declined billion from the fourth quarter operating losses declined billion from the fourth quarter which included elevated litigation accruals personnel expense which is typically seasonally elevated in the first quarter declined million from the fourth quarter driven by lower employee benefits expense the decline in employee benefits expense was driven by million of lower deferred comp expense which was partially offset by million of seasonally higher payroll taxes and 401k matching expenses wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 we also had lower expenses in a variety of other areas including commission and incentive comp outside professional services technology and equipment and as you would expect travel and entertainment the enhanced benefits and payments we provided to employees in march as part of our response to covid19 did not meaningfully impact our expenses in the first quarter but we currently expect that they will have a greater impact beginning in the second quarter and through the remainder of this year while these costs will add to our expense base the actions we took were the right thing to do to support our employees before discussing our business segments starting on page i want to note that as a result of the new flatter organizational structure that was announced in february we will be updating our operating segments when we complete the transition and are managed in accordance with the new five business segment structure community banking earnings declined million from the fourth quarter reflecting higher provision expense as well as net losses from equity securities on page we provide our community banking metrics ill start by noting that as always our digital mobile and primary consumer checking customers are reported on a onemonth lag so the numbers reported here for first quarter do not capture the change in customer behavior we experienced in march due to covid19 for example our customers have shifted to depositing checks through our mobile app and the dollar volume of mobile checks deposited increased over in march compared with february turning to page teller and atm transactions are reported through march which is when we reduced our branch hours and temporarily closed approximately onefourth of our branches as a result of covid19 which resulted in an approximate decline in teller volume during the final weeks of the first quarter compared with the year ago our customers also meaningfully reduced their card spending late in the first quarter due to the impacts of the pandemic during the first two months of the year credit card volumes were up from a year ago while march volumes declined approximately from march resulting in first quarter credit card purchase volumes being down from a year ago we also had meaningful shifts in customer spending in march with grocery and pharmacy spending increasing while all other categories were down from a year ago debit card spending trends were similarly impacted but the change in spend was less significant with yearoveryear growth in january and february and a decline in yearoveryear volumes in march similar to credit card debit card spending shifted significantly to grocery in march but the growth in this category started to slow in the last week of the month turning to page wholesale banking earnings declined billion from the fourth quarter reflecting a billion increase in provision expense ive already highlighted the strong loan and deposit growth from our commercial customers in first quarter and we also raised billion of debt capital for our clients wealth and investment management earnings increased billion from the fourth quarter during the first quarter wim experienced strong demand from clients for liquid products periodend deposit balances increased from the fourth quarter reflecting higher cash allocation in brokerage client assets and assets under management in our wells fargo asset management business grew significantly driven by over billion of inflows into our money market funds despite the market volatility closed referred investment assets into wim from the consumer bank partnership increased on a linkedquarter and yearoveryear basis and flows into our retail brokerage advisory business remained positive in the first quarter as a reminder retail brokerage advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter so first quarter results reflected market valuations as of january and second quarter results will reflect market valuations as of april wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 turning to page our net chargeoff rate was up basis points from the fourth quarter to basis points predominantly driven by higher ci losses primarily related to higher losses in our oil and gas portfolio reflecting significantly declines in oil prices we had net recoveries in all of our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios and lower losses in our auto portfolio the increase in credit card losses from the fourth quarter included seasonality nonaccrual loans increased million from the fourth quarter to basis points of total loans which was up basis points from the fourth quarter and down basis points from a year ago commercial nonaccruals increased million predominantly driven by the economic impact of the pandemic consumer nonaccrual increased million predominantly driven by higher nonaccruals in the real estate one to fourfamily first mortgage loan portfolio as the implementation of cecl required pci loans to be classified as nonaccruing based on performance on page we provide detail on the performance of our oil and gas portfolio oil and gas loans outstanding increased linkedquarter and from a year ago reflecting increased utilization rates driven by the impact of covid19 and the decline in oil prices total commitments declined reflecting a weaker credit environment the significant decline in oil prices in the first quarter resulted in early signs of credit deterioration particularly in the ep sector total oil and gas net chargeoffs increased million in the first quarter to million nonaccruals declined million from the fourth quarter due to the higher net chargeoffs as well as paydowns partially offset by new downgrades to nonaccrual status in the first quarter approximately of nonaccrual loans were current on payments during the quarter criticized loans increased from the fourth quarter predominantly reflecting increases in the ep sector on page we highlight our adoption of cecl at the end of first quarter the allowance for loans in debt securities was billion billion of this allowance was for loans and unfunded commitments and our allowance coverage ratio was of loans we added billion to our allowance for credit losses since the adoption of cecl on january this increase was driven by a number of factors including economic sensitivity due to the covid19 pandemic the estimated impact to industries most adversely affected by the pandemic our exposure to the oil and gas industry draws on loan commitments during the quarter which were the primary driver of commercial loan growth and a million reserve build for debt securities reflecting economic and market conditions turning to capital on page even after a multiyear program to return excess capital to shareholders our cet1 ratio was at the end of the first quarter which continued to be above the regulatory minimum of and our current internal target of our periodend common shares outstanding were down million shares from the fourth quarter on march we along with the other members of the financial services forum suspended share repurchases through the end of the second quarter in summary while our results in first quarter were impacted by the economic and market uncertainty caused by the pandemic we maintained strong liquidity and capital our priority is to continue to use our financial strength to help the us economy by serving our customers supporting our employees and donating to our communities and charlie and i will now take your questions operator do you want to open it up for questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co operator are there any questions operator operator instructions john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co the queue is filling i understand charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah operator how are we doing operator your first question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hey ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning guys thanks a lot for the color in the deck today can i just ask you john can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of it was good to see the fed giving you some flexibility to participate in the programs on lending but can you elaborate a little bit more on are you truly able to provide all the help that your customers are asking for and how are you balancing that demand function on behalf of clients with the magnitude that you have to dial back and the effects that that might have on the company from an income state perspective thanks john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure yes thank you so on the ppp front which is the targeted action where the fed gave us a little extra flexibility there i would describe us as unconstrained and in a position to help everybody who approaches us subject to the program of course having sufficient funding from a legislative perspective but no constraints at wells fargo with respect to the other tradeoffs as i mentioned the first places that were going to be able to create more capacity to help customers are to reduce nonoperational deposits principally in the financial institutions area where were relatively easily substitutable and its a low value use of cap balance sheet because theres a high runoff factor on those types of deposits and there are tens of billions of dollars of those types of deposits to continue to work down wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 and then secondly our securities financing footprint or i would describe that as ph is that plus different sources of wholesale funding we did this in when the cap was originally put in place but weve dialed back some of the repo financing and other securities financing that we provide and then our own utilization of external repo as a financing source to create more room and the sum of those activities is first and foremost gets us down below the cap on a spot basis but then will create some amount of room for us to make choices about how to help our customers and it starts with existing customers and making sure that we can meet their needs and thats what were focused on right now charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey ken this is charlie i know you didnt mean it this way and i just want to make sure that its clear for everyone else is that we have no restrictions on participating in these programs what the fed did is they allowed us to go above the existing balance sheet cap so that we could participate in a more holistic way without having to adjust other items which as you know is difficult to do in a shorter period of time so it provided us the flexibility to do far more than we had chosen to do ourselves based upon our capacity ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes exactly thank you charlie and second question john understanding fully the pulling away from giving fullyear guidance is there a way you can help us understand on the nii front just how youd expect the trajectory at least to go from first to second given the changes and all the moving parts that were in this quarters results thanks john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah its a fair question but not quite yet weve got the i think were all forecasting something like zero in the front end depending where libor moves over time and then some number between call it basis points and basis points at the long end how deposit pricing reacts to that and it came down in this quarter and we anticipate it coming down rapidly over the course of the remainder of the year will be a big driver what of these recent balances that we just booked stick versus those that dial back down i think will be a big driver so not looking for nii growth im sure it will be down by some amount but were not being any more precise and hopefully by the time we get to either mid or at the end of the second quarter well be in a position to be a little bit more declarative about that ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah i appreciate that thanks guys john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thank you charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thanks wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning a couple questions one just on the outlook for cecl and the cecl charges you obviously went through in detail what you did this most recent quarter so im just trying to understand what kind of unemployment level youre assuming in that just so if we see it traject differently from your assumptions we know how to think about reserve builds from here john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah so its a combination of things including unemployment but to our level and then for how long and then the same with gdp obviously other things that are going to matter are what this stimulus means at the personal level and at the business level and whether thats an effective offset to the impact on consumer credit from employment so our scenarios and theres a few of them were relying on and we have different weights on each basically are sort of highsingledigits sustained down gdp and sustained unemployment really through into well i take it back we get flat to gdp in but really not much growth so quite elongated in terms of the ushape hopefully thats helpful and well update as we go along were a little less relying on sharp spikes and sharp recoveries and thinking about this a little bit more as a long slow burn over the next couple of years for risk management purposes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then if i could drill down just on the oil side obviously we went through an oil event several years ago with like and you had some workouts around that brought down the oil exposure or the gas exposure since then maybe if you can give us a sense as to how youre thinking about this goround the price is obviously a little bit lower but im thinking that your book has changed a bit maybe if you can give us some color on how youre dealing with that portfolio and what your expectations are there john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yep thanks and the book does look different so on the one hand its smaller on the other hand its a little bit its more senior we had a bigger weight on lowering the capital structure activity before going into the downturn were imagining because of the levels of resource price that losses given default are substantially worse this time through in terms of the migration of performing to nonperforming id say in our own creditloss analysis were assuming basically acrosstheboard full notch downgrade type of in our own estimation of default probability and i think were approaching it in a pretty sober basis weve got a good number on it now both specifically and through our qualitative reserve and well continue i think to up our disclosure around it like we did in as we work through that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 okay but thats embedded within your cecl estimate today already so if it pans out as expected we wouldnt to see any more reserve build on that specific asset class john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well so yes and no we always end up reserving more than we end up charging off so when im thinking about the through the cycles chargeoff my sense is we have a line of sight on how we expect it to perform but for any number of reasons we do and cecls different than the prior methodology but im not surprised when we lean in a little hard and it turns out that cumulative losses were less than the allocated number it just seems to work out that way betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thanks operator your next question comes from the line of john mcdonald with anonymous research sic autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hey john charlie john i was wondering if you could give any more color on the base case economic scenario that you baked into the first quarter reserve build and given that what kind of macro scenario would have to materialize in the second quarter for you to have a similar size provision or to be adding more than you added in the first quarter and then maybe charlie you could just add some thoughts on the potential paths you see for this credit cycle relative to what youve seen in your career charlie what are some of the similarities and differences as you think about how this might play out relative to great financial crisis or stress test scenarios thank you john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure ill go first and john its still autonomous research right not anonymous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yes thank you john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co make sure we get that right so as i mentioned to betsy were taking a longer window approach rather than a quick v or even a quick u in thinking about growth through the rest of the year and into next year being mid to highsingledigits negative this year and flattening out but not growing really next year and then unemployment in the long and sustained highsingledigit range there already have been perhaps spikes that go beyond that but were thinking about this as it plays out quarterafterquarter wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 so just to dimension it compared to other scenarios thinking about both our performance in the financial crisis as well as our own ccar severely adverse scenarios at this point we see this as not generating that level of loss in our own ccar severely adverse scenarios and if we produce nine quarter credit losses of about in total with peak quarterly loss rates expressed on an annualized basis of about and an average of about thats got a steeper drop in gdp and a steeper climb in unemployment and importantly no stimulus baked into specifically adverse case it doesnt anticipate the types of interventions that weve already seen and were waiting to see materialize and with respect to the financial crisis as a benchmark importantly at least for wells fargo it may be true for other banks as well but loan portfolios were very different then the quality of loans particularly on the single family side was worse i think our auto portfolio was worse then too and so there we did produce higher well somewhat higher loss rates even higher loss rates than we do today in our own ccar analysis because the content of the portfolio is different but i guess i would describe what were currently imagining now to be call it halfish of an annualized loss rate of the severely adverse version of our own stress test and so if things play out substantially worse then theres certainly the possibility that we end up building more or experiencing more chargeoffs or both but we feel good about the approach that weve taken in march developing our scenarios with our governance around it and coming into the quarterend and charlie you may have comments on the comparability charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah listen i think as i said in my remarks i think we all know we havent seen anything like this before theres no clear path to with any narrow range of outcomes for what unemployment or gdp will be i mean when we think about different peoples estimates i mean you can see gdp differences of points across very smart people who do this for a living same thing with unemployment points differences and so making an analogy of what this environment is to other environments i just have a very hard time doing having said that i think we feel like the portfolios that we have are stronger than they were at other downturns as i think they certainly are in many banks out there the real question will ultimately be how long this shutdown actually continues which again none of us know but in addition to that how our actions whether its the forbearance plans that we have or the fee waivers the things that were doing very actively to help our clients and the huge amount of government intervention whether those things will actually be able to bridge individuals and small businesses and larger corporations to the other side of this i personally wouldnt be surprised that as the earnings cycle continues and as we start to see these numbers even though people are talking about big numbers theyll potentially continue to be surprised by the size of them and that will create additional volatility in the environment that we live in and it wouldnt surprise me to continue to have to add to reserves as those things impact confidence and ultimately what economic growth looks like but as i said i think its different and again what we know is were strong and the industry is strong to be able to handle this john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research great and as a quick followup to that charlie the idea of banks maintaining dividend payments is a big debate right now not just for wells fargo but for the industry overall and youve cut the majority of distributions you and wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 the other banks twothirds of it has been buybacks and folks talk about the importance of dividends as signaling can you talk about the pros and cons of keeping the dividends for yourself and the industry charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah well listen i think certainly the dividends are certainly important for all those that own the stock and ultimately those that wind up benefiting from stock ownership are individuals in one way or another whether its direct holdings or whether its pension plans and things like that and so i think the income stream that people come to rely on especially at times like this is important but there has to be an underlying ability for companies to be able to pay and so to the extent that they have that ability to pay i certainly think its the right thing to do for the reasons that i just said we have strong capital ratios we do all the stress tests and whatnot that john referred to and determine our ability to return capital in these severely stressed environments also remind you that that for us we are slightly different than others because of the balance sheet cap so our balance sheet cap does limit our ability to deploy capital internally and so based on that thats why we sit here and look at and say that we think the dividends certainly that were paying makes sense but as i alluded in my prior comments we dont know what the future looks like based upon the assumptions that weve laid out in these very stressed environments we do feel good about it but ultimately the timing and the pace of the recovery is going to determine earnings capacity for everyone to be able to continue to support the level of dividends john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research thanks operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning i just wanted to ask a clarifying question on johns question on the dividend because it is a question that investors are asking a lot about wells fargo specifically so before you reported earnings consensus was at for this year versus a dividend of and i just wanted to make sure im taking away the right message and thats the market shouldnt really look at the payout and instead given that the bright line on capital distribution would be breaking that cet1 we would continue to monitor where your capital levels are relative to the minimum and because of the balance sheet restrictions unlike some peers you are less able to eat through your capital through rwa growth is that the right way to think about the dividend going forward john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i think thats right id also id add charlies view though that as the quarters unfold and we figure out how long were going to be in this economic state and what the path forward looks like and we use that to interpret and estimate what our goforward earnings trajectory looks like thats the context for understanding what the steady wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 state dividend should look like so in terms of what this years dividend looks like versus this years consensus or estimated earnings during a time of stress is less germane i think than a the fact that we start with ample capital and b what we think our run rate more steady state earnings are and the way out of this and reflect what the dividend is in light of that so if thats helpful but yes the point that charlie was making about the fact that were not really in a position to go out and generate substantial incremental rwa through outsized loan origination is an important one and a distinguishing one versus others who may be doing that right now and expanding their balance sheet intentionally erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and my second question is on forbearance and just a clarification question also on something that you said john so if its possible could you give us some updates on how many of your clients if you could give it to us by mortgage by auto are in the 90day or 60day forbearance period how april payment behavior was like and also just clarifying what you said john you said that potentially the losses the cumulative losses this cycle would be of the severely adverse which i think for nine quarters was billion john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co what i said was that the current loss rates that are in the scenario that were talking through are in the neighborhood of half of our current severely adverse i think youre probably looking at last year and so im not making a call on the cumulative level of losses im just making a point that as a benchmark in response to johns question for contextually like what does that really look like in that instance over nine quarters generated a calculated aggregate credit loss and for context in terms of where we are now these loss rates are lower than that by more than half roughly half but im not predicting that were going to go through a cycle like our own severely adverse stress test cycle that lasts for nine quarters goes that deep et cetera just providing a benchmark with respect to deferrals i think were in deferrals im including loans on our own books as well as loans that we service for others because the customers dont distinguish when they call wells fargo and i think at this point weve had requests for deferring over million payments its about billion worth of pi i think about of that relates to loans on our own books and of it is loans serviced for others its disproportionately auto and mortgage the dollars of course are mortgage because the pi is bigger there than it is on auto loan i dont have the specifics in front of me beyond that but thats what it amounts to and then it probably is worth mentioning at least with respect to the loans on our own books that we would be deferring interest into the future and recognizing interest revenue on an effective interest basis which would reduce the amount of interest income in the current period by some amount its not at this point doesnt seem to be a large amount well give updates on that as this number flattens out at some point and we recalculate all of the pi and effective yield but i dont think its going be a huge difference maker in terms of our interest income recognition for the year erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thanks erika operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question john i think you mentioned at one point during the call there has perhaps been a little bit of an abating in the pace of line of credit draws i wonder if you can just talk to what youve been seeing since the quarter end i guess it stands to reason that with the quarter ending and your customers may be doing some window dressing there would be less need for line of credit draws but how is that actually trending and how would you expect those balances to behave is that cash actually getting used or are you seeing it just indeed redeposited back into the bank what are the phenomena at work there john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yep so those we monitor daily draws just to understand whats happening by industry by customer by customer type et cetera and they really have flattened out and they have been negligible for the last several days more than a week and so they peaked probably at the end of the third week technical difficulty in april pardon me in march and then came right back down so not growing at anything like that pace so the related question of how long do they stick is a good one and i guess it depends on the reason for the draw to begin with whether it was window dressing whether it was a need to access credit markets some of which had been closed and some of which are more or less open high grade market wide open obviously but for people who need to go into the syndicated loan market or the high yield market its a little bit more by appointment depending on their story there were people who drew because of just a hardcore liquidity preference and they wanted to have quick access to the cash regardless of the messaging that they were sending to their external stakeholders and they may continue to have that preference for liquidity until people know when the economys going to open back up and depending on the nature of the borrower what it means for their sales forecast and so i dont think weve seen any meaningful paydowns yet and as i mentioned in response to the question about nii guidance whether or not those balances remain outstanding will have an impact on this quarter one way or the other and currently theyre sticking so but theyre not really growing r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then if i can ask a second question just on slide where you go through the ci loans by bucket can you talk a little bit about the financials except banks portfolio i know youve discussed it in the past but just given all the turmoil theres been in some of the nonbank areas just maybe a little color and sort of what we should be thinking about that john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 yeah so the buckets of activity there theres the clorelated activity so credit managers theres subscription finance where were providing leverage to alternative asset managers against the commitments of their limited partners to fund when called theres leasing theres auto theres card theres mortgage theres commercial mortgage et cetera im sure well see a little bit more stress in the system as it relates to the loan balances they by and large tend to be the highest quality loan balances on a ratings basis or among the highest quality that we have because theyre generally credit enhanced pools of cross collateralized receivables of one form or another and thats a huge benefit to us compared to the average portfolio of home loans where you have first dollar of loss if something goes bad in a loan having said that these types of customers will have stress often in their origination function if theyre an originator or in their ongoing capital accumulation if theyre an asset manager there can be stress on the servicing side of this for those that are residential mortgageoriented their lifes going be a little bit harder presumably as servicing advances default servicing things like that pop up and so were managing them in that way on the clo front which is a big distinguishing portfolio for wells fargo in addition to whats here theres a little bit of overlap but also in our securities portfolio we have 30ishbilliondollars worth of clo exposure disproportionately top of the capital structure aaa aa that can withstand an extraordinary almost a complete level of cumulative defaults with varying levels of loss given default and were still very comfortable with that and of that portfolio is externally rated aaa which i think is a plus so there havent been meaningful signs stress here we will talk about it if it becomes so we actively manage it in our allowance calculations and these are very actively managed borrower relationships as i mentioned r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay thats perfect i appreciate all the color so thank you for taking the questions john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah you bet operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez of ubs john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hi saul saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey how are you guys thanks for taking my questions wanted to tackle a couple of things really quickly first the interplay of credit in cecl so you trued up you ticked up your reserves obviously and your ph acl ratio is roughly about basis points and this is probably oversimplifying it but one way to think about that ratio under cecl is its an estimate of what you think youre going to lose on the entirety of your loan book over the life of the loan at any given point in time and that number is lower than what it is for any other large bank even as of january so i want to get your perspective on how much of that you think is a reflection of just you guys having lower loss content loans a better wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 risk profile of it as opposed to maybe some other more idiosyncratic things as i seem to recall that youve marched in loans in the past that were in recovery positions and stuff like that so and i ask also just because i do get that question occasionally from investors asking if youre underreserved relative to your peers which i dont think is the case but i wanted to get your perspective on this john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yes i think its a good question and i think loan mix has a lot to do with it the question about marked loans historically would have been true but with the adoption of cecl most of those marks had to be reversed which was the source of a portion of our day one adoption negative number so we dont have that to rely on although we used to i think the biggest difference is probably the weights that we have on jumbo mortgage versus the weight that we have on credit card on a headsup basis versus other peers and thats true of both outstanding as well as undrawn and the allowances there to serve both our credit card portfolio which under most conditions we wish was a bigger capability for wells fargo at times like this is a little bit of a saving grace because the expected loss content both in whats outstanding as well as what might be expected to come through from undrawn is more manageable in the size of our balance sheet its still as youd expect the higher loss content higher loss rate exposure because its consumer unsecured and unemployment will be a big driver of losses in this cycle or any cycle but on the first lien mortgage front because that business has changed so much and between borrower capacity to repay reserves ltvs et cetera even in stress our loss estimations for that portfolio are really quite low and so as you run down different categories of ci or commercial real estate or the various consumer categories credit cards the highest and first lien mortgage is the lowest and there we have the biggest weight on mortgage and probably the lowest weight on card saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay and i presume in your form 10q and in your y9cs youll be giving loan loss allowance by lending category so we can compare you to your peers by segment right john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yes saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc and just one final one do you have a sense or have you disclosed how much youve actually reserved or would you disclose or have a sense for how much youve actually reserved for oil and gas and entertainment and all of the higher risk sectors on i think slide to just to get a sense of where you stand in terms of reserve levels in those categories john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co we havent yet because most of that is still a part of this qualitative topup of the reserve which is how the big build for this quarter went down this is all estimation and as a result its not specifically allocated by loan grade and by portfolio it will get there those are the industries that i mentioned the categories that i mentioned are the wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 ones where weve leaned in the hardest and on a qualitative basis assumed certain levels of downgrade which lead to the higher reserve factor being attached to them but it hasnt run through the process yet that way because we havent had those downgrades so we will start to provide more information im not sure if it will be in the form 10q but certainly as the cycle unfolds and these things actually start to appear in the calculated graded reserve for ci categories in particular r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co got it thanks a lot john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hi john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning back to the through cycle loss number your number i know you just indicated that cards would be the highest in that assumption do you have what those throughcycle numbers are that you have buy bucket for example commercial real estate and card and ci that make up the john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co right so the is the ccar severely adverse through the cycle cumulative loss level so its not our through the cycle loss level and im not sure whether i wasnt clear i dont want anybody to walk away thinking that thats what we anticipate experiencing through the average cycle we have not laid all that out i guess i would look to the categories of loan loss disclosure with our last stress test those come from the fed they dont come from you get two wells fargos but we havent gone category by category and laid it out i can tell you that on the commercial side its about and on the retail side its about but in terms of the individual components we havent run through that with folks john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay got it got it and then regarding the loan loss reserve from here i believe charlie you indicated in one of your previous answers that you could see incremental loan loss reserve builds from here is that a fair assumption at this point given your expectation for the ongoing stress on borrowers et cetera that we could have incremental builds or do you think the were at an adequate level given the recast of the back book and what you put on this current quarter in terms of where your reserve stands at this point charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 yeah i guess im not an economist and so i dont pretend to know any more about the future than anyone else whos in my position and what i said was i think its clear that economists are having a difficult time trying to figure out what the trajectory of unemployment and gdp will be what i was saying was it just it wouldnt surprise me that people will continue to be surprised by the downside in the numbers weve not seen anything in our own portfolios to suggest that we will be adding in the future but if confidence does deteriorate and the shelterinplace orders stay on for longer which is possible then it wouldnt surprise me that loss estimates would have to go up from this point again i just its not based on something that weve seen we dont know the impact of all the programs that are out there which weve never seen anything like this before but theres probably i think its fair to say at least in my mind theres more downside than there is upside at this point just given the uncertainty of the environment today john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it thats helpful if i can ask just one more on the drawdown point i know you had implied that youre seeing a little bit of stability there on the draws has the drawdown from the commercial side trended as you had expected or would you have thought that they could have exceeded the current level where theyve showed some nearterm leveling off john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah so they came out of the gate fast and furious before borrowers actually experienced meaningful stress so i would say that was a little faster than we probably would have imagined in terms of how things have leveled off the prior question about whether there was window dressing going on through the quarterend where our borrowers wanted to have cash on their balance sheet its certainly possible that that was a part of it the cp market being inaccessible for many users and the highgrade market being expensive or closed for a little bit certainly contributed to it too both of those things are functioning better now and these balances are still maintained so its not crystalclear whether that was a contributor to it but it seemed a little fast the fact that it i think that folks are like charlie mentioned with respect to own results were trying to understand how long theyre if theyre meaningfully affected from a sales perspective how long shelterinplace is going to change the nature of their business and theyre going to make their liquidity determinations along the way it feels like many people many business leaders made that determination relatively quickly in the early draws but its as i said its flattened out charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co the only other thing id add is that john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co this is not as we say over and over again this isnt something that weve seen before and so would we have thought that the number of industries and businesses would be shut down as quickly at the same time no does that increase draw levels and the speed at which they draw it absolutely but the fact that were seeing some stability in those numbers and reductions in terms of where they are says an awful lot about the actions certainly that the fed has taken to stabilize the markets and give people the confidence that the markets will function well when they need to access them john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thanks charlie operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hi matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning it seems like expenses in the first quarter came in a bit lower than expected even if we adjust for the deferred comp noise any outlook that you can provide on costs for the year john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co not meaningful we instituted a few programs for our employees in the first quarter that didnt cost much in the first quarter that will probably contribute a little extra throughout the course of the year on the other hand theres a range of revenuerelated costs that will probably be lower with commissions incentive comp types of things if the depending on business conditions of course and our ongoing level of performance ge is pretty much down to zero because people are not traveling theyre sheltering in place we will have different technology costs theyll probably get a little bit more expensive as weve enabled people to work from home that all has to get factored in and then of course weve got certain types of expense that are levered to where the stock price is et cetera and that will in this environment will probably be cheaper than it was a year ago but not anything targeted or meaningful in this moment during the public health crisis beyond that charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and the only thing that i would add is as we think about what the future is we were very clear on the last call about our views on our efficiency and the work we had to do and given the environment that were in this is not the kind of environment where were able to realize any meaningful savings so we need to see light lineofsight past this crisis in order to continue to get back to the work that we have to do to drive that number down which we still completely believe is there doable and the right thing its just going take a little more time at this point wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay understood and then youve made some comments in terms of the regulatory issues and obviously the flexibility to help small business customers but any just kind of broader update on addressing the regulatory issues and there were some headlines that you were missing some deadlines in the media which doesnt seem surprising since a lot of things are shut down but just anything you want to add from a regulatory perspective that youre able to comment on charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co im not going to talk about anything specific its not the right thing to do ill just reiterate we have a lot of work to do ive been saying that very very consistently our ability to get beyond some of these regulatory actions is based upon our doing the work properly there is a bunch of it were continuing to devote all the necessary resources towards it even during this crisis and thats really what i can say at this point matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay understood thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak of wolfe research john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hi steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so john just wanted to ask a question about how youre managing the securities book i recognize you guys pulled the nii guidance but im just trying to understand given this significant decline at the long end of the curve i was hoping you could help us frame where youre reinvesting today versus it took roughly yield on the securities book and maybe just bigger picture whats your appetite to reinvest in other asset classes outside of agency mbs and treasuries to maybe mitigate some of those reinvestment pressures john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah its a good question so where were investing today and i think were weve got billion to billion a month of expected prepayment and maturity that needs to get redeployed we have been and will likely continue to redeploy it into hqla there are certainly interesting opportunities in creditsensitive securities et cetera they were really interesting in march but theyre still interesting today but for low liquidity value more risk weighted types of investment were more likely to use our dry powder for our customers so for loan growth rather than on the securities front even though historically we would have done both and a portion of that is related to the existence of the asset cap so its still likely to be treasuries ginnies and agency mortgages as we redeploy that billion to billion per month for the rest of the year wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it and just for my followup i just wanted to try and gauge the nearterm outlook for fee income i know theres a lot of moving pieces this quarter it looked like if we adjust for all of the specials it was about a billion drag suggesting maybe a core fee run rate somewhere around billion im just wondering as we look ahead just given some of the pressures you cited on service charges spend volume contracting lower fees in wealth given lag quarter pricing i guess youll have an offset from mortgage i just wanted to try and frame how we should be thinking about the right jumping off point for core fee income in and maybe just speak to your outlook for the remainder of the year john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thats complicated for all the reasons weve been describing i would say that youre right about the stepping off point for wealth and investment management that will be lower i expect mortgage to be stronger we have a billion pipeline and a stronger gain on sale on a per pound basis so the second quarter should be good in that respect the markets businesses are actually doing really well right now although investment banking is quieter high grade is open but there isnt quite as much going on in noninvestment grade or equity issuance card fees should be lower because transactional volumes are lower deposit service charges my sense will be lower because of actions that were taking on a targeted basis to reverse fees where its appropriate and it never works to add it all up and give a core number but those are probably the bigger influences on fee income going into  steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great very helpful color and thanks for taking my questions john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah youre welcome thank you operator your next question comes from the line of charles peabody with portales john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hello charles charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc hi its my guess that tail risk events are not over for this economic cycle so i was wondering if you could address two different tail risks as they relate to managing your interest rate sensitivity and the impact on your pl the first is if we go into a multicore period of negative rates what are the actions you can take to manage that and how do you see that impacting your pl wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 and then the second is if fund vigilantes ever do come back and we get a steepening of the yield curve basispoint spread between and what impact does that have on your pl as it relates to nii mortgage banking and equity securities or debt securities john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc and then finally from a john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i like the second one better than the first one charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc i know you would but also did you take any material actions in the month of march to hedge your interest rate risk going into the second quarter so those are the three separate questions sorry john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure so well go in reverse order in the month of march i would say getting longer duration not much longer but continuing to replace and add to duration in this investment portfolio is the most visible activity to defend against going lower in rates in any size on the second question about what happens if we get a steepener obviously theres a hit to capital from oci when that happens because our bond portfolio loses value but with the amount that we have regularly to reinvest with deposits at levels that they are et cetera we are sensitive to the call it that to 10year points and without putting a specific number on it its probably the its among the biggest drivers in terms of the way were positioned for increasing net interest income and the reverse is true as well and then with respect to negative rates theres a handful of things its obviously looking at europe or looking at japan theres plenty of examples of why thats not a terrific environment to be in for banking but on the liborbased lending side id make the point that i think substantially all of our ci loans that are liborbased have floors in them so that were not worried about eating through margin still an attractive place to be but weve protected ourselves in that way i think there are a range of depositrelated activities that we have where we would begin to institute charging for holding cash given the existence of the asset cap we cant overpay for deposits because were in the business of sending low liquidity value deposits back to bank customers and the like so we would probably be pretty quick to be managing what we pay for deposits to so that we didnt have an incremental influx that we didnt have an appetite for and then as i mentioned adding or maintaining some fixed rate posture duration a long duration posture on the investment portfolio is a way to abate earning a negative rate as rates go below zero i dont think youre suggesting theres a high probability of that i think the feds been pretty clear there have been instances where wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 bills went negative just because of technical factors but i dont think its at least currently a part of the playbook for the fed and then the other jurisdictions around the world where it has occurred ph out the curve which started with the policy decision to do it at the frontend so i like the steeper curve better than the negative rates among your questions charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hi brian brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey morning just a quick question first maybe the mortgage banking can you kind of walk through the decision to exit on the nonconforming correspondent i heard thats driving loss rates below in residential mortgage was it an issue with the asset cap or just credit risk more broadly john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co its really shelf space and putting our own retail customers at the front of the line as one of the levers that were using to manage living under the asset cap brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co not credit risk in particular brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then a separate question then there was a lot of kind of oneoff items in the quarter that were due to just to where markets were at the end of the quarter or where spreads were i know there was the reserve for debt securities equity impairments and then also on hedge ineffectiveness are any of those expected to reverse given where markets are at this point in time or where rates are for the hedging activity wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co on hedge ineffectiveness i wouldnt expect that to reverse or to persist its sort of a confluence of events that gave rise to it for the quarter so that probably goes back to that expectation of call it a netzero expectation and it can drift up or down depending on what happens in the liborois basis or for some other reasons in terms of equity impairments well there are some measurement alternative activities that actually do get written back up when the situation warrants it but i wouldnt expect that to happen in the early stages of a recession if thats where we are in the next few quarters obviously there are lots of ways to earn that back over the life of those investments but it will take a while for that to reveal itself and what was the last one there were a couple of different examples brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc the reserve for debt securities john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co oh yeah i dont anticipate that it will that relates to both afs and held to maturity securities so presumably there is some afs securities that might get sold or mature that release some of that but i dont think it just comes right back that is the nature of otti yeah brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions charlie and john couple of things firstly how did total criticized loans do in the quarter i know you mentioned oil and gas have we seen any firstly any numbers and have we seen any impact of any of those other industries where theres concern and as you look at your commercial loan book you broke down the drawdowns into cib commercial banking commercial capital and cre any color on the outstandings in those and also the breakdown of how criticized did in those four categories john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co so criticized loan balances increased about billion in the quarter almost all of it in march im trying to do the math here yeah a big piece of it for those that are in the industries that we mentioned earlier airlines for example youll see it in energy for sure there is some commercial real estate that has already come through its so early because this all occurred in size in mid to late march it will probably see more of that realizing itself in  which is part of why our allowance build is really so much from a qualitative perspective its based in math but its not driven by loan gradings et cetera which drive the quantitative approach wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 so i think youll see it coming from the usual places well have more specifics in the 10q when we file it and then of course well see the behavior in actual well receive financials well administer loans on a loanbyloan basis through the second quarter and that will update the quantitative model and the disclosures in  vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and how does your commercial book break down between cib commercial banking commercial capital really those are your three biggest categories and i guess theres a little bit of cre included in ci any color on that john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co there will be when we publish those segments what we have in the deck today that shows total ci outstandings and commitments is a superset of those businesses so you can see the total where we draw the lines between what is in which segment we havent added it up and disclosed it that way but you will begin to see it that way in  vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay another question you mentioned on the page on deposits that you grew deposits in consumer through high yield savings any color on why youre growing high yield savings youre really not trying i didnt think you were trying to grow deposits any color on whats behind that john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah well high yield isnt the same today as it was a year ago some of where we grow is the preference of the customer choosing where theyre going to put their money in this the label of high yield savings means something different as i said a little bit earlier were forecasting our deposit cost to come down substantially throughout the remainder of reflecting what youre suggesting which is in a flighttoquality timeframe with liquidity a preference by our customers the deposits are rolling through the door and we are not overpaying for them you will see in  i think substantially all of the incentives from last year as we were building deposits in a slightly more expensive timeframe to finally roll off and then through   and  as we currently forecasted were going to be heading get back to deposit costs of the call it era vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yep operator and ladies and gentlemen we do have time for one more question and that last question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 thank you good morning gentlemen john can you share with us on slide you gave us the total outstandings and the total commitments i think it was about outstandings to commitments what was that number at the end of the fourth quarter of and within those categories you gave us who had the biggest drawdowns john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wow thats a very specific question youre asking me gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc saved the worst for last john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah yeah yeah yeah well so i dont have that information right in front of me i can tell you that as a category and this was on slide in the same deck our utilization rate jumped up almost to so for the whole universe of wholesale commitments we had been in the high and now were in the high of utilization im going to have our ir folks follow up with you because we do we have been tracking utilization or i should say draw requests by industry and that might be useful but i dont have it right in front of me gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no thats good thank you if someone else complimented you guys the breakout the portfolios for oil and gas retail transportation entertainment was very helpful if you could provide a suggestion for the next time for the financial except banks i think that would be helpful and one last question for you its a technical question if your assumptions in cecl are correct on the economy that you guys use to build up the cecl reserve this quarter if theyre correct in the second quarter do we see the provision being primarily then to cover net chargeoffs and loan growth and no more cecl reserve buildup is that correct is that the way we should look at it john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co in theory if you had perfect foresight but you also have to kind of know rwa growth in the same timeframe because at minimum youd be capturing allowance for the change in the loan portfolio from one quarter to the next but i would discourage anyone from imagining that at the point in time that any bank has got perfect clairvoyance about what the future holds and whether it gets better or gets worse im sure it will be a little bit different gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no no doubt i appreciate that thank you for the candor john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 yeah john r
