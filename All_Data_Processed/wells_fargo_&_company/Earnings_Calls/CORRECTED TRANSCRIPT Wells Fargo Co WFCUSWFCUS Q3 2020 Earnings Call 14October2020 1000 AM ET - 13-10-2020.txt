morning everyone ill make some brief comments about our third quarter results provide some commentary on the operating environment and our direction ill then turn the call over to john to review third quarter results in more detail let me start by acknowledging that this will be my last earnings call with john who announced his retirement in july john has served as an excellent financial and strategic leader for our company and has been incredibly helpful to me in my first year at wells john thank you very much for all youve done you will be missed as you know mike santomassimo will be joining wells fargo this week as cfo mike has more than years of leadership experience in banking and finance and most recently served as the cfo of bny mellon and im looking forward to mike hitting the ground running im going start by making some comments on the markets economy and operating environment that impacted us this quarter most market and liquidity trends are strong and continued to improve in the quarter despite modest credit spread widening that followed volatility in the equity markets market spreads have continued their steady improvement since the peak of dislocation and remain significantly tighter than the levels observed in march corporate new issuance volume remains elevated hqla bidask a measure of the cost to transfer risk and daily volatility have improved and are now below precrisis levels and the feds pledge of unlimited support has improved risk appetite tightened spreads and deepened market liquidity the economy has materially improved due to the gradual reopening but also the significant monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as the significant accommodations made by financial institutions and other businesses labor markets clearly reflect momentum with the third quarter average jobless rate improving to after posting a rate during the second quarter however theres still a long way to go and there remains significant risk to the recovery the pace of job growth and the rebound in consumer spending have slowed and the diminished pace of reopening and the end of some stimulus programs are presenting headwinds the powerful rebound in the third quarter still leaves the economy well below its precovid peak including restaurant sales lower real gdp lower and unemployment below precovid levels clearly the recovery is in process and while the gains weve seen this quarter are important the path to full recovery for all remains uncertain let me now turn to our performance this quarter we reported net income after tax of billion or a share revenues benefited from very strong mortgage banking and most other feerelated items also improved over the prior quarter with the exception of trading which while down from the exceptionally strong second quarter still produced strong results wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 nii declined reflecting the impact of the lower interest rate environment and lower loan balances primarily driven by weaker aggregate demand across our commercial client base expenses were elevated and impacted by two significant items million in customer accruals and a million restructuring charge chargeoffs declined from the second quarter and our allowance was largely unchanged credit performance across almost all loan products was stronger than we would have anticipated a quarter ago however its certainly too early to draw conclusions yet the actions from the fed our government and financial institutions i referred to earlier have clearly helped consumers and companies of all sizes but much of this is ending and the total risks of covid are behind us these individuals and companies are still at risk without more support having said that the fact that we are in a better place than expected is a good thing and that shouldnt be lost our top priority continues to be the implementation of our risk control and regulatory work but were also taking targeted actions to improve the experience for our customers clients communities and employees i will discuss this later we continue to add talent to the senior management team and key roles to strengthen the foundation of the company in addition to mike joining as cfo ather williams is joining wells fargo this month to lead our strategy digital and innovations group and will report to me he will lead corporate strategic planning define and manage digital platform standards and capabilities and manage innovation priorities opportunities and company wide efforts to drive transformation we added other senior leaders including a new head of home lending and several key risk leaders as part of our enhanced risk model to further strengthen the independent oversight of all risktaking activities and provide a more comprehensive view of risk across the company in august we announced that mark chancy was elected to companys board of directors mark has more than years of banking and financial services experience with an impressive combination of business operational and finance experience he serves on the boards audit committee and risk committee in the third quarter we also launched clear access banking a new lowcost convenient bank account with no overdraft fees clear access is off to a strong start with over accounts signed up so far and is proving very popular with people under a big part of its intended target population this is part of our broader efforts to simplify our products and services and create clear easytouse and better experiences for our customers as part of our simplification efforts we will be reducing the number of different consumer checking accounts we offer making it easier to both our customers and our bankers while also reducing expenses associated with supporting legacy products we continue to have over employees working from home and we dont anticipate this changing until at least december just under of our branches remain temporarily closed but weve opened more of our branch lobbies to enable our customers to come in and have conversations with our bankers instead of just using our drivethrough for transactions and our teller and atm transactions increased from the second quarter wells fargo was recently recognized as leading the us financial services industry in covid19 safety according to a nationwide study this is great recognition for the work of all those at wells whove worked tirelessly to keep our employees and customers as safe as possible wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 we continued to make significant accommodations for our customers since march weve helped more than million consumers and small business customers by deferring payments and waiving fees the trailing sevenday average of new daily payment deferrals granted as of september has declined from their peak in early april debit card spend has remained strong since returning to precovid levels in may and in the last week of september was up approximately from the same week a year ago consumer credit spend improved throughout the third quarter but still is down approximately in the last week of september compared to a year ago an improvement from being down approximately from a year ago as of the end of june this reflects steady improvement across a variety of categories but despite a rebound hard hit segments like travel entertainment and fuel remain significantly lower yearonyear commercial card spend remained significantly lower throughout the quarter and was still down approximately in the last full week of september compared to the same week a year ago digital usage trends continue to be strong as an example mobile deposit dollar volume was a record high in the third quarter and was up compared to a year ago let me take a moment to expand on the conversation i started last quarter on expenses we believe that our franchise is capable of earning far more than were earning today we continue to believe theres nothing structural in our business to stop us from having a competitive efficiency ratio though we are far from it today prior to wells fargo had an efficiency ratio that was far more competitive with our peers as you know weve had to make significant investments in people and technology to address prior underinvestment in risk and controls and also have an outsized litigation and customer remediation expenses this accounts for part of our elevated expense base we also believe that we have significant opportunity to take targeted actions that are focused on improving the experience for our customers clients communities and employees these actions should also improve operational and financial performance we have also lagged behind our competitors in revenue performance and we also believe weve got significant opportunities to make substantial improvements here as well to be clear our focus starts with running the company more effectively and efficiently this includes reducing bureaucracy simplifying our products processes and our organization reducing redundancy in manual work and migrating customers and employees to digital solutions all of this will also improve our control environment lower expenses will be a byproduct of doing these things were taking an organized and structured approach to reviewing this across the entire company weve established dedicated teams in each of our lines of businesses and functions were reviewing nearterm mediumterm and longterm actions were already working on the nearterm actions including streamlining management ranks through spans and layers and other business improvements again these are driven at making it easier for us to serve our customers and each other wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 these actions were the primary driver of the million restructuring charge we took this quarter these actions should reduce gross run rate expenses by over billion annually we also identified many medium and longerterm actions that will take some time to fully implement these include simplifying products in many of our businesses optimizing operational and client service delivery and continuing to downsize our corporate real estate portfolio i understand that many of you would like more specifics on our plans the reviews were conducting across the entire company continue and we are in the midst of a planning cycle we need to be thorough in our work and its important that we understand three pieces before providing specifics to you the magnitude and timing of the initiatives i have just discussed where we think we need to invest to drive improved operational and financial performance and most importantly understanding the investments necessary to complete the buildout of our risk and control infrastructure which will ultimately satisfy our regulatory commitments i cannot stress the importance of this work enough we cannot and will not do anything to jeopardize this work it is also important that mike have a chance to review our plans which he will do immediately all that said we should be in a position to provide more specificity regarding expense expectations on our call next quarter while there is much work to do and it will take time our ultimate goal is to build a bestinclass business and hope to show progress along the way this includes both competitive level of expenses and competitive revenue performance finally i want to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to making wells fargo better i will now turn the call over to john john richard shrewsberry chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co thanks charlie and good morning everyone we earned billion in the third quarter up billion from the second quarter driven by lower provision expense we grew revenue but our expenses remains too high ill be describing the drivers of our results in more detail throughout the call so let me just summarize a few items that impacted our third quarter results that we included on page as charlie highlighted we had a million restructuring charge predominantly driven by severance expense which drove the increase in noninterest expense in the third quarter and is expected to reduce our gross run rate expenses by over billion annually we had million of customer remediation accruals for a variety of matters the increase in this accrual related mostly to previously disclosed matters and reflected an expansion of the customer population the time period andor the amount of reimbursement as part of our ongoing analysis of doing the right thing for our customers while resolving outstanding matters as quickly as possible we also had million of noninterest income related to a change in the accounting measurement model for nonmarketable equity securities from our affiliated venture capital partnership as you know we typically have gains or losses from equity securities driven by market valuations which we had again in the third quarter wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 our effective income tax rate for third quarter was near our expectations and we currently expect our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter to be less than primarily as a result of expected tax credits turning to page our capital and liquidity continued to be strong with our cet1 level billion above the regulatory minimum and our lcr percentage points above our regulatory minimum at the end of the third quarter our primary unencumbered sources of liquidity totaled approximately billion turning to loans on page both average and periodend loans declined from the second quarter with growth in consumer loans more than offset by declines in commercial loan ill explain the drivers of commercial and consumer periodend loan balances in more detail starting with commercial loans on page ci loans declined billion or from second quarter driven by higher paydowns reflecting continued liquidity and strength in the capital markets and lower loan demand including revolving line utilization declining to precovid utilization levels particularly in our middle market business commercial real estate loans decreased billion from the second quarter reflecting weaker demand in commercial real estate mortgage which was partially offset by growth in commercial real estate construction in categories that have not been negatively impacted by the pandemic this includes multifamily projects and industrial facilities including data centers consumer loans increased billion from the second quarter this increase was driven by the repurchase of billion of first mortgage loans from ginnie mae securitization pools we had a high level of these early pool buyouts in the quarter due to covidrelated payment deferrals we also reclassified billion of first mortgage loans from heldforsale to heldforinvestment credit card loans were relatively stable from the second quarter as consumer spending increased after declining over billion for two consecutive quarters however balances were down billion from a year ago reflecting the economic slowdown associated with covid19 auto loans declined million from the second quarter and originations declined we continue to take certain actions to mitigate future loss exposure while our spreads on new originations continued to improve other revolving credit and installment loans increased million from the second quarter as higher security based lending was partially offset by lower personal loans and lines and lower student loans during the third quarter we notified our customers of our exit from the student loan business as part of our ongoing process of pruning certain businesses as we assess our strategic priorities turning to deposits on page we continue to have lower deposit growth than the industry due to actions weve taken to manage under the asset cap however even after these actions average deposits grew billion or from a year ago and were up billion from the second quarter the linkedquarter growth was driven by noninterestbearing deposits which were up while interestbearing deposits declined periodend deposits increased billion from a year ago but declined billion from the second quarter this decline was driven by actions weve taken to reduce nonoperational wholesale banking deposits as well as pricing and other actions in our consumer businesses wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 consumer and small business banking deposits grew billion from the second quarter reflecting continued covidrelated impacts including customers preferences for liquidity loan payment deferrals and stimulus checks average deposit cost declined to basis points down basis points from a year ago and basis points from the second quarter net interest income declined million or from the second quarter primarily due to the low interest rate environment which resulted in balance sheet repricing as earning asset yields continued to decline faster than funding liabilities balance sheet mix shifts into loweryielding assets including the impact of lower commercial loan demand which resulted in higher cash balances and million of higher mbs premium amortization due to higher prepayment rates these declines were partially offset by higher variable sources of income and one additional day in the quarter for the first nine months of our net interest income was billion with the completion of the third quarter we now expect fullyear net interest income to be approximately billion which is lower than our previous guidance due to lower commercial loan balances and higher mbs premium amortization turning to page noninterest income increased billion or from the second quarter with growth in many feerelated businesses while weve continued to waive certain fees for customers impacted by the pandemic depositrelated fees were up million from the second quarter driven by higher customer transaction volume trust and investment fees increased million from the second quarter primarily driven by higher retail brokerage advisory fees partially offset by lower investment banking fees with fee accounts down from record second quarter levels card fees increased million from the second quarter with debit card transaction volume up and credit card purchase volume up mortgage banking fees increased billion from the second quarter the mortgage origination market should be the largest on record and capacity constraints continue to increase margins total residential heldforsale mortgage originations increased from the second quarter to billion and our production margin increased to basis points up basis points from the second quarter and up basis points from a year ago we currently expect fourth quarter origination volume to be similar to third quarter levels despite typical seasonal declines and fourth quarter production margins should remain strong mortgage servicing income increased billion from the second quarter due to million of favorable net msr hedging results in the third quarter and a negative valuation adjustment in our msr model as a result of higher prepayment assumptions and higher expected servicing costs in the second quarter that did not repeat net gains from trading activities declined million from a record second quarter primarily due to lower fixed income trading results partially offset by higher equity trading results turning to expenses on page our expenses increased million from the second quarter primarily driven by the million restructuring charge that i highlighted earlier on the call charlie highlighted in his comments the details we have on slide on the progress were making to reduce expenses and build a stronger wells fargo many ideas have been generated with the fresh perspective from wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 leaders throughout the organization this renewed focus is critical to our future success not only improving our efficiency ratio but also enabling us to become more streamlined and agile and better serve our customers while we continue to invest in our business and meet our regulatory commitments turning to our business segments starting on page we continue to make refinements to the composition of our operating segments and allocation methodologies additionally were still in the process of transitioning key leadership positions including mike santomassimo who will be joining wells fargo later this week we now expect to update our operating segment disclosures including comparative financial results in the fourth quarter and provide fullyear results under the new reporting structure on page we provide our community banking metrics we have million digital active customers up from a year ago and from the second quarter digital logins declined from record second quarter levels but were up from a year ago and the number of checks deposited using a mobile device reached another record high in the third quarter and increased from a year ago with approximately of our branches temporarily closed due to covid19 and more customers using our digital channels our teller and atm transactions declined from a year ago but increased from the second quarter as the economy began to reopen and we reopened more of our branches turning to page wholesale banking reported net income of billion up billion from the second quarter driven by lower provision for credit losses revenue declined million from the second quarter reflecting lower net gains from trading activities and investment banking fees both of which were at record levels in the second quarter net interest income declined from the second quarter primarily due to lower loan and deposit balances and lower fixed income trading assets average loan balances declined from the second quarter revolving loan utilization in september of declined basis points from june and unfunded lending commitments increased from the prior quarter wealth and investment management earned million in the third quarter up million from the second quarter primarily driven by lower provision for credit losses and higher assetbased fees benefiting from improved market performance the decline in earnings from a year ago was driven by the billion gain on the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business in the third quarter of wim average deposits increased billion from the second quarter and were up billion or from a year ago driven by higher cash allocations in brokerage client accounts wim deposit costs in the third quarter were in the single digits and have declined over basis points from a year ago turning to credit results on page our net chargeoff rate declined basis points from the second quarter to basis points which was better than we anticipated a quarter ago given the challenging economic environment losses improved across our commercial and consumer portfolios however customer accommodations weve provided since the start of the pandemic could delay the recognition of net chargeoffs delinquencies and nonaccrual status so its too early to draw any conclusions about future losses based on credit performance in the third quarter commercial criticized assets declined from the second quarter with broadbased declines in ci partially offset by an increase in commercial real estate loans nonaccrual loans increased million from the second quarter driven by higher consumer real estate auto and commercial real estate nonaccruals wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 on page we provide more detail on our ci and lease financing portfolio by industry including the declines in loans outstanding and total commitments from the second quarter ci and lease financing nonaccruals were stable from the second quarter as declines in oil and gas and retail were largely offset by increases in other industries including health care and pharmaceutical and transportation services of note of nonaccruals were in oil and gas down from in the second quarter turning to our commercial real estate portfolio on page commercial real estate nonaccruals increased million from the second quarter with declines in hotelmotel and agriculture more than offset by increases in other categories with the largest increase in office buildings criticized assets were up billion or from the second quarter with of the increase driven by hotelmotel shopping center and retail sectors the percentage of our consumer loan portfolio that remained in a covidrelated payment deferral at the end of the end of the third quarter declined as we show on page we had declines across our consumer portfolios these calculations exclude first mortgage loans that are guaranteed or insured by the government which we believe have minimal credit risk on page we provide detail on our allowance for credit losses for loans our allowance coverage for total loans was in the third quarter with stability across most loan classes and an increase for credit card loans our allowance of billion was stable from the second quarter reflecting an improving economic environment and solid credit performance in the third quarter but with continued uncertainty due to covid19 in determining our allowance we considered current economic conditions which improved compared with prior expectations as unemployment levels decreased during the third quarter we also considered that recent credit performance reflected the support of fiscal stimulus lender accommodations and borrowers ability to access liquidity these factors drove lower loss expectations in our quantitative models however there is increased uncertainty in economic forecasts but very widely and future credit performance may deteriorate as stimulus effects that benefited recent credit performance come to an end we increased our qualitative reserves reflecting a variety of factors including our exposure to significantly impacted industries the limited transaction activity and wide variability in market valuations for property types in our commercial real estate portfolio and the elevated default risk for borrowers as payment deferral programs end while the timing of the end of the pandemic and the eventual path to an economic recovery remain uncertain we believe that our allowance captures the expected loss content in our portfolio as of the end of the quarter turning to page as i highlighted earlier our cet1 ratio remained well above our regulatory minimum increasing to in the third quarter as you can see our standardized and advanced approach ratios are now in very close proximity we currently expect internal loan portfolio credit ratings which were also contemplated in the development of our allowance will result in higher riskweighted assets under the advanced approach than under the standardized approach in the coming quarters which would reduce our cet1 ratio and other rwabased capital ratios that said we expect to maintain strong capital ratios that exceed both regulatory requirements and internal targets after considering this expected trend in riskweighted assets in summary while our results in the third quarter improved from the second quarter they were still down significantly from the year ago reflecting the impact of the economic downturn even though we cant predict the path to a full economic recovery were focused on improving business performance by reducing our expenses while meeting our regulatory commitments and appropriately investing in our business and well now take your questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hi betsy good morning john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc a couple of questions one is on the billion improvement in expenses that you outlined earlier in your prepared remarks i realize that youre talking about a lot of investments that you need to make as well but im just wondering is this billion expected to come through in net expense reductions as we look out over the next year charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey betsy its charlie thanks for the question i would say i referred in the remarks as its gross reduction betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co its real it will be there well see it next year but were still continuing to go through our plan for next year and were looking at all of the investments that are necessary both on the control side as well as the investment side and so its too early to be definitive about what the net numbers look like at this point but as i said last quarter we want to show progress and progress is a combination of taking actions on the gross side but also showing you something on the net side but i think the right thing at this point is to give you much clearer guidance on next quarters call after we finish our budget work and after mike gets to review the work himself wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it yeah okay i get that and then just separately charlie you were mentioning how theres opportunities to get more efficient theres also opportunities to get i dont know your share of the revenue could you i know its early but could you give us a sense as to what youre thinking about when you highlight that where do you see opportunities for wells on the revenue side charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure i mean i would say when we look at our business and put the trajectory of nii to the side for a second because of the low rate environment just talking about building the franchise and the opportunities that present itself i think when you look at ill just go businessbybusiness quickly when you look at our consumer and small business banking franchise weve been on the defensive now for a very long time appropriately so given the issues and problems that we had a tremendous amount of work has been done by all the folks leading those businesses our franchise is still extraordinarily strong and you see it by the way even in just the deposit growth that weve had in that segment which says an awful lot about the about what our customers think of us but while we had been investing in some of the digital capabilities which you do see in the marketplace tremendous opportunities to grow with the affluent customer base at the other end weve rolled out a product for those that are far less affluent which is very competitive and getting real traction and so i just i think in the consumer and small business space the opportunities are significant in the consumer lending space the mortgage business the demand is greater than our ability to process at this point still and thats still where we sit today we have opportunities in the card space to leverage the customer base that we have staying with our within our risk framework the way weve defined it were just doing a better job at delivering card and other payments products the commercial bank i think is an extraordinary franchise and both things that we do on a standalone basis there as well as things we do in partnership with products we have in the corporate investment bank are still huge opportunities for us in our wealth and investment management space the wealth business were one of the few that have this sizable franchise in a space that we love weve made progress at having the business work together across our private bank and across our brokerage business but were just getting started there and i think the opportunities even with the very strong performance weve had this quarter are still extremely strong and then lastly in the corporate investment banking space and just i would have said as an outsider that wells had been very very smart at building the business in where it has traditional strength in serving customers and thats the path well continue to be on so when i look at all these businesses i feel very good about our ability to grow the franchise and its a question now of timing and prioritization betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay anything in particular you think about maybe saving to make room for growth given the asset cap is kind of getting in the way of growth on the balance sheet at least wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i mean i think so i mean were very actively looking at not below those five businesses that i just described were very actively looking at all of the portfolios and all the businesses below that and were going to continue to exit some things which arent core to the us banking franchise that we are not that its us only but supporting the core customer base that we have and so i would expect over the next couple of quarters we will create some room on the balance sheet by exiting some things that arent core betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay super thanks thanks charlie appreciate it charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co but i do want to just but i just want to be clear were exiting them because they arent core to serving our core customer base on the consumer and large corporate side were not exiting them because of the asset cap betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i got it charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co itll help operator our next question will come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning that was a really good kind of overview of how youre thinking about the businesses just from a big picture perspective i think a lot of investors are looking for kind of this big rollout of the strategy that puts some numbers and more meat behind kind of what you just said and obviously covids delaying that i would assume obviously youre really focused on regulatory issues but is that something that you do plan to do and is the timing of kind of getting out of the asset cap driving something like that say like a virtual investor day or something similar charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah well i think you said it very well matt and i appreciate what you said which is that theres no doubt that in terms of the way wed be thinking about the trajectory of the business and what the opportunities for us over the shorter and earlymedium term are different today that were in this covid environment than not and so its kind of hard to have a meaningful conversation that looks well beyond that when were far from through this and so we are very focused on the things that we need to do in this environment to improve our performance albeit with an eye towards making sure that were building the company for the long term wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 the regulatory work as you mentioned again i said it in my remarks i cant stress it enough its a gating factor for us to be able to take advantage of all the opportunities that we have in the franchise were putting a tremendous amount of time and attention and effort towards it and understanding exactly what those resources look like and how that impacts the company is the work that we continue to go through and as i said by the time we get to the end of next quarter well give you a clear look as to what we think that means for and then listen the asset cap i wish there was more to say about it but were focused on controlling what we can control which is doing the work thats been asked of us which is totally appropriate were in the process of doing that and theres no doubt that while the asset cap exists that we do have a limitation that others dont have others have other limitations with different ratios and whatnot that is one that we have and so it is fair to say we will not be able to extract the full potential out of the franchise until after the asset cap is gone doesnt mean that we dont have the opportunities to grow from where we are today we can talk a little bit about that if you want but that certainly does factor into our thinking about what the trajectory of the company looks like and the time frames matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just to be clear in terms of kind of presenting kind of this call it while the asset cap is still there and kind of the postasset cap view is that something that youre going to come out to investors and put some targets out there and again some more meat behind the strategic update or is it well get the expense outlook in and a little bit more kind of piecemeal as you think about giving guidance and strategic outlook charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i would expect that wed be giving you not just an expense outlook but an update on how were thinking about the different businesses and when we talk about things that belong and that dont belong how that fits and then were also going be giving you at the end of the quarter when we report not just the quarter but the fullyear results based upon the segment looks which were made pretty clear where we stand versus our competition and well be able to talk through what those differences are and how we think about that john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co it also reflects some strategic decisions that have already been made and allow you to look at the businesses on a headsup basis versus competitors the way the current leaders are intending to run them going forward so theres a lot of information in that matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just lastly if i can squeeze in on the asset cap i think february is going to be three years which investors asked me like how long i think its going to linger and im like i dont really know but theres four ceos three chairs three years theres obviously been a lot of change a lot of effort and then theres only so much that you can share and theres only so much that you know but like what should we be looking for from the outside because cumulatively it does seem like theres been a lot of effort and hopefully its accelerated the past year but it seems like theres been a lot of important milestones at least from an external point of view so what can we look for if anything wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co listen i think i mean what you can look at is you can look at the people that we have in roles today that have dealt with these issues before and the organization today does in fact look very different than it looked a year ago or even six or nine months ago and as ive said when you look at the fed consent order its pretty straightforward in terms of what theyre asking for the environment that theyre asking for is the same thing that theyve asked all the other big banks for so getting the experience inside the company to actually that actually understands exactly what is required of us i think is extraordinarily important and that team is actively working through whats got to be delivered again i wish i could say more matt as i said its ultimately the regulators on all of our issues are going to be the ones to determine when its done to their satisfaction but again i can tell you theres no question in my mind that we have a firstclass team in place now working on it thats experienced many that have dealt with these issues before it has this sense of urgency in the company which i think is different than what we had in the past the amount of time and resources that the senior team is spending on this is extraordinary youd be shocked at the amount of time because we know we need to do whats required and beyond that again i cant speak for the regulators so thats what i would say matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks for taking all my questions charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co hey ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning guys hey john just on your nii point understanding that were still kind of seeing this decline in loans and the premium am does the fourth quarter get to a stabilization point with nii as you look out into next year and what would be the drivers to kind of put that bottom in as you think about the mix of earning assets and what you expect with deposit growth thanks john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co yeah so the pieces of it are deposit pricing on the one hand and thats come down meaningfully it has a little bit more to go but will likely bottomout in the lowsingle digits versus the highsingle digits where it is today on the asset side yeah the softening in ci loans in particular has been a contributor to things underperforming even recent estimates and the question of where we go there both the industry and wells fargo will be i think wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 at the margin the swing factor in what happens for nii and for nim over the course of the next year or so and if we get a little bit of steepening that would be very helpful the way were sort of looking at it its possible that we end up flat to down singledigit percentages in nim knowing what we know today as charlie mentioned the forecasting process isnt done for next year and so therell be more guidance on that as that comes into clarity but those are probably the big drivers right now also on the security side you mentioned premium am so weve got mortgage securities prepaying rapidly were replacing yields with call it 140basispoint yields in the current yield which will bring down the overall book average a little bit too so thats in our forecast but its a little bit different than in the or a continuation of what happened in  we expect that premium amortization to continue right into next year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right john can i just ask you to clarify you said flat to down nim but did you mean nii dollars or can you just kind of rego through that again just so we all heard it right john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co yeah i meant nii sorry in dollars ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then can you help us understand what a steepener means in terms of like what does a 10year delta do to your net interest income to your point about just a helpful steepener if we got it on an allthingsequal basis john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co yeah well it depends what we choose to do with it in terms of how much we redeploy but if you could get the 10year up toward basis points something like that were talking about billion or more of net interest income again it depends on how quickly we redeploy into that what happens to mortgage yields at the same time but we are sensitive at the long end of the curve ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right understood thanks a lot john operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning id say from the feedback from charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning the feedback from the investor community essentially indicates that they understand that its going to take time to have a thoughtful plan especially in expenses i think whats surprising the market today is the base upon which were thinking about potential future gross reductions is a little bit higher than expected so i guess my first question is as i take out the restructuring target out over the third quarter run rate that would imply billion with elevated operating losses and suggesting an annual base of billion is that the right expense base from which we should think about future gross reductions and also investments charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah no i would in our own math we would also consider the elevated operating losses to be more infrequent and not part of the run rate so i get to a lower number on my own i mean the reported numbers are what they are and should be accounted for but as were thinking about whats run rate and whats not the elevated levels of operating losses even though theyve occurred now for a couple quarters in a row are not anticipated at this level and restructuring charges im certain there will be more by the way because that will be evidence if the companys making progress in its plans but i wouldnt just consider that to be run rate either so that would get you to a lower number erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co i think i mentioned that erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch if i can just followup with that go ahead john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co yeah go ahead no go ahead erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch just to followup with that actually so i think you previously mentioned that a more normal level would be million annually and so if i take that elevated level out then the base upon which we would then say okay this is the base and then theres further improvement from here would be billion clearly different math in terms of your future earnings power is that the right way to think about it john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co thats how i think about it yeah that million still seems like a good number i think in this quarter we have about million worth of what we consider to be run rate operating losses fraud robbery the standard things wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 that have been in place for a long time and whats above that is more episodic and in this quarter had much more to do with the closure of legacy types of issues erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it very very helpful and just as a followup question to kens line of questioning all three of your megacap bank peers essentially indicated that net interest income has either hit a bottom in the third quarter or will hit a bottom in the fourth quarter assuming no change in the outlook for rates and obviously no change in terms of the asset cap is that a statement that youre also confident in saying on nii bottoming john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co no i mentioned it could get a little bit softer next year remember that were operating with an asset cap that doesnt allow us to expand the size of the balance sheet and earn a little bit of incremental net interest income on these extra deposit balances that were all gathering and so at the margin that could be a differencemaker there are other things that go into what our level of nii is but at the margin thats a constraint that we have that others dont erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you for clarifying john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co yeah operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi back to the expense discussion on the billion gross expense run rate reduction can you maybe give us a little bit more detail around the timing of the realization of that could it be more frontend loaded in terms of the annual impact charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 yeah so it is a gross number but the impact will be immediate in the run rate because weve accelerated the costs associated with the actions and those expenses will drop out john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay so its more immediate impact there okay and then separately in terms of the additional detail on the expense the longerterm expenses next quarter with fourth quarter when you give us more details could we get more of the larger expense opportunity detail in terms of potentially the billion that was flagged before and maybe even an expense i mean efficiency target beyond that just want to get an idea of what type of metrics charlie that you might be in a position to give us thanks charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i think listen between now and then well figure out exactly what were going to give you what i said was that we will give you a clearer outlook as to what to expect for expenses for at the end of the quarter we also said that youll be seeing the disclosure of our segments broken out differently and much more comparable to what others report and so youll be able to see the gaps between our efficiency ratio by business and others and just to be clear what i said at the end of last quarter was all we did was we did the math of the people we compete against and said whats their efficiency ratio looking at business mix and whats ours and thats the difference and so i assume you all do those calculations as well were acknowledging it and those are the conversations that we have internally to say is there any reason why our expense base shouldnt be look different so youll see what those gaps are and we will certainly be in a position to talk about the types of things that we will be doing to close the gaps some of which will be in progress and others which will be to come john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay no thank you thats helpful if i can just ask one more thing on the lowgrowth front i know you mentioned that ci is still youre seeing a pressure there and that is a big factor in terms of your spread income outlook can you just give us some color around what youre seeing in terms of commercial demand and could we see some improvement in ci balances or at least stabilization there john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co sure so theres a handful of things going on at the upper end for corporate and institutional borrowers were seeing continued utilization of the loans that they have but not a lot of incremental demand for more credit in the middle market theres a lot of different stories but they can be summarized to saying that the utilization of existing facilities is down meaningfully below precovid levels obviously we all had this spike in the first part of the year that has abated but in the middle market and including assetbased lending were seeing lower inventory levels held by customers who would use our financing to fund that inventory some of those may be coming back as inventories get rebuilt some of them may not but its at the margin that is thats pulling down balances and also i say on the high end with the capital markets as wide open as they are both for highgrade credit as well as for more levered credit that is replacing the utilization of bank loans by funding those things in the capital markets and thats the story wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and this is and ill just state the obvious right which is that ultimately the path of the recovery is going to determine the levels of demand that are out there and while we try to be very careful in our remarks about when it comes to credit saying that its too early to draw any conclusions at the same time as you look forward as you get into next year there will be a vaccine there will be therapeutics the world will continue to open and everyone is learning how to do it safely even in todays environment and ultimately thats whats going to drive business activity and demand and that happens well be the beneficiary john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks charlie thanks john charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey saul saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning hey good morning first of all good luck on your future endeavors john and ill be sorry to not have you on these calls going forward but i guess first of all i want to sorry to beat a dead horse with this question but i just want to make sure i have a good handle for what we should expect so the yearend results well get the outlook for expenses in in addition to enhanced segment disclosure which will allow us to i guess more effectively compare you to your peers on a segment basis and i guess whats still a little bit unclear to me is what if at all is the plan to go beyond that and give maybe more farreaching goals as you kind of continue to go through your strategic review should we expect to see longerterm financial targets and expense reduction plans and maybe longterm expense targets is that still the plan and it will be determined at a future date when youre able to and feel comfortable giving those targets or is that just kind of on hold for now charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well i think three things saul by the way i completely appreciate the line of questioning and so the fact that its being asked a bunch i completely understand we have a couple of things that we need to get through we need to finish all of our internal work to understand what it takes to actually build the actions around becoming more effective and efficient at running the company at the same time were continuing to invest to both build out the company and to do the regulatory and risk work that has to get done wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 theres no doubt that the environment that were in today gives us pause in terms of committing to anything on a longerterm basis because then well show you a number then youre going to say well whats the timing and obviously its very highly dependent on what the world looks like because of covid the asset cap because that obviously does impact our ability to grow the balance sheet and offset some of the nii reduction which ultimately impacts the efficiency ratio and so as we get more clarity around what those things look like we will provide more detail its just not clear when the right time to do that is but well tell you everything we know when we know it saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc right john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co one more thing to add saul so what youll see at the end of the year is that the results as they reflect will also show some the results of some strategic decisions that have already been made so that will be helpful at the margin saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay no thats helpful i want to go back to erikas line of questioning on how to think about sort of a more normalized basis the expenses currently and i think a lot of us have been kind of normalizing the op losses to the million million a quarter i mean i guess my question there is like why is that the right number because you havent been anywhere near that number for a quarter in about it seems like five years and i guess i get the normal amount of fraud and whatnot but its been much much higher than that for a very long time heck even before the sales issues and i guess so is that really the right number and i guess maybe a more important question is when do you feel like youll have some of these customer or these litigation accruals that have been pretty elevated in three of the last four quarters kind of run their course and come back down charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah so i guess ill start and john you can add i would say when we look at the customer remediation accruals for both this quarter and last quarter they are very discrete items where we went through all of the items that we have in our customer remediation queue of which everything material relates to prior practices that have been around for a period of time were working really hard to put these behind us and put these behind us means determine exactly what were going do for remediation work with our regulators where necessary to make sure that they understand what that means and what we did over the past couple of quarters is to try and go through the entire inventory to ensure that we were current and realistic about what our actions are and what were going to do to move these on and so weve done that i wish it would have taken one quarter as opposed to two but it took two and not that there wont be anything going forward but we dont see anything that looks at all materiality of the types of things that weve done and so we think its those things are booked its in a good place and were just doing the work to implement them now john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 and then in recent years there have been sort of range of litigation but theres been two big pieces of litigation that have contributed to this in a way thats not expected to recur one being that at that point 10yearold rmbs settlement where we were among the last people to be brought into the settlement process and then of course the sales practicesrelated litigation that was settled earlier this year and that similarly is not expected to recur so i get your point which is its been elevated for a long time but when you disaggregate it and look at what is the run rate in the business that we mentioned that adds up to roughly million a year versus what things are specifically related to what i described with the legacy issues that is where the line gets drawn but saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay i think john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co the proof will be demonstrating but saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co yeah saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co printing a few quarters at million or below would be helpful saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah yeah well its been a while since youve been in there and youve been talking about that number for a while so john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co actually in the second quarter of it was million so thats an example saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay got it but like the nii guide wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co third quarter saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah the nii guide just final one just clarity when you say flat to down thats fullyear versus because it seems hard to be flat given kind of your run rate as you exit john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co yeah it depends on what happens with loan growth thats a good point but that is the full year versus full year saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so wanted to start off john with the question on liquidity management weve heard different messages from your peers regarding appetite to redeploy excess liquidity into mbs and help mitigate some nii pressures youre currently running with arguably the largest excess liquidity pool of all the money center banks i was hoping you could frame the potential benefit from remixing into higheryielding securities and is any of that contemplated in the nii guidance that you provided for next year john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co yeah whats contemplated is continuation of roughly the same level of deployment which requires redeployment given the rate at which things are prepaying so its a question about how long you want to get in a sub1 year environment with mortgage yields at these levels in the event of a backup its a problem its a capital problem its an earnings problem versus the tradeoff and what happens if rates stay low for a very long time or frankly go lower from here or even go negative and what that means from an earnings power perspective so those discussions those tradeoffs are measured and revisited each time we have an alco discussion given what the forward look is for what could happen to rates and deposit flows and loan demand and other things so we have liquidity available for loan demand we certainly could redeploy tens of billions of dollars into mbs or probably even more into similarduration treasuries theres some liquidity difference in the characteristics there but i think as you heard from at least one of our competitors really loading up at these levels and locking into both duration andor negative convexity doesnt seem like a great tradeoff and so were faced with those same choices and right now were essentially redeploying to stay at about the same level wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc indiscernible charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co with that kind of said so in terms of how we think about the opportunity and also how it factors into the asset cap so just trying to be clear about what ive tried to say before which is we have an asset cap that we have to live with but we do have some room to operate as we sit here today because of the liquidity that we have because of where the balance sheet is actually running today because of other actions that weve taken and as we think about exiting some things that can create some balance sheet room for us and so while we dont have the same capacity that others have we do have capacity to deploy more of our capital towards loans than weve currently deployed john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co thats right steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great thank you both for that color and then maybe just a question for you charlie on the expense outlook im going try to take a different tack here given that one of the biggest sources of pushback that we hear from investors is that while the opportunity to drive expenses lower is quite clear and evident and the risk is that revenue attrition is difficult to handicap and could be greater than anticipated especially given how significant the revenue attrition has been since the last investor day update recognizing you were not in the seat at that time but just curious as you begin executing on the cost plans and head count reductions and what efforts are you taking to help limit revenue attrition and your confidence level that you can achieve efficiency gains while protecting revenues charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure yeah i guess let me answer it a couple of ways first of all when we take a look at just whats happened to the franchise in terms of attrition i mean the reality of who we are is we are more of a traditional consumer and commercial bank than some of the other large competitors we compete with and so the reduction in nii in those businesses has an outsized impact on us relative to the others because of the business mix and so that revenue decline is not franchise loss in terms of what it means to customer relationships when we look at the individual businesses and how theyre performing from a customer franchise in our consumer business in our middle market business in our wealth business as well as the large corporate business i actually look out and say its been extraordinarily strong given all this company has been through when we think about the actions that were going to take first of all for things that we are going to exit it doesnt either fit with what we do or have the right return characteristics and so those are a core set of decisions which when we go through them and you see what they are youll look and say yeah that makes sense given who wells fargo is wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 and then the other actions that were taking are all about improving the franchise were not and so just to be clear and i tried to say this in my remarks were not going around saying we have to cut x billions of dollars and everyone line up and just do it it is about what do we have to do to run a better company so that we can be more efficient internally at getting work done and deliver a betterquality product for our customers business by business theres a gigantic amount of redundancy in multiple platforms across common products common processes those are the types of things that are going to drive the efficiency of the company but it will make us a betterrun company and so we have extremely heightened antenna when it comes to anything which impacts the risk work or could hurt the value of the franchise and in fact as i said the conversations around doing everything to help the value of the franchise steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great thanks charlie for all the color and john best of luck with your future endeavors john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co thank you very much charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thanks operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions charlie john let me just start with one clarification charlie you talked about the fact that the operating losses youve been trying to work on this for the last couple of quarters i want to check in on one thing the reimbursements youre trying to make sure that where you needed to expand the horizon in terms of customers time period et cetera given that were concerned about the run rate of this number going forward has that been signed off by regulators or is there still that process to come so that theres some potential that that could change because of the regulatory angle to it charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah without being specific about whether somethings signed off on by regulators id say that we have a the belief is by the business leadership and everybody around it that weve arrived at the right numbers that make sense for customers put these issues behind wells fargo and shouldnt be met with any disagreement vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay let me shift gears just a quick one treasury management you talk about fee revenues this time in your slide deck normally youve talked about total revenues can you give us what the total revenue did for treasury management i know thats an important business for you wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah it is and it gets split between the commercial business and the corporate business i know that were the way were describing it i think is theres a tradeoff between nii for earnings credit rate and fee revenue so the way weve described it in the deck is all the specifics were putting on it right now we can talk about breaking it out a little bit more now that were in a rate environment where we dont have to pay customers through treasury management fees for putting noninterestbearing deposits with us but i dont have any more clarity for you right now vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay one last thing charlie in terms of the businesses that youre talking about the operations wealth management operating margin was only this quarter pretty low given what you folks have also delivered in the past any color any granularity on whats keeping it so low is there a potential to improve that through any business changes charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co theres certainly a possibility of it i mean its a question of what were generating in loan spread and loan yields in that business have come down i think theres a belief by the new leadership in that business that theres a much bigger opportunity for securitiesbased lending among other types of lending for wealth customers that we havent really tapped in the past so thats probably going to be marginenhancing on the core feegeneration business the margin isnt likely to change very much given the relatively linear connection between revenue and expense vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yes operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning john good morning charlie charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 john can you share with us on the premium amortization you guys obviously have seen this in the past and in past cycles and i know you said its going to continue to be a force on the margin going into if interest rates stay at this level when do you think it will start to meaningfully come down from the current level and second what kind of impact is the fed been having on keeping the yields down in this market with their active buying which actively buying the mortgagebacked securities john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co yeah so a meaningful impact is the quick answer to the second half of your question i would expect the pace of premium amortization to stay in place throughout mortgage securities in part because of the fed and in part because of the industrys ability to sort of shift and even speed up take frictions out of the refinancing process which speeds up prepayments i think were operating at about cpr right now that isnt going away whether its virtual inspections virtual tours paperless closings or at least electronic closings et cetera its made it easier and easier for people to refi and thats going to keep speeding things up we think weve accounted for that in the way that weve measured that risk in different parts of our business but i dont think its going away and eventually well have a burnout in the moneyness of the stock of mortgage securities but theres still a long way to go i think we mentioned that our expectation for our  very near term but our  looks a lot like  in terms of volume and margin and i think as charlie mentioned were operating at capacity and so is much of the industry gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and pivoting to you charlie i know the asset cap is not what im asking about with this question but you did point out that you guys are spending a tremendous amount of time on getting everything right with the regulators if youre comfortable can you give us a timeline of when you send in the documents when do the regulators start to see the work that youve done i assume its already underway but where we could kind of then figure out maybe the regulators could give us outsiders a decision that yes you guys are out of the penalty box and is off to the races charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co again i think its a hard question to answer what ill say is first of all the regulators are alongside us every single day they see exactly what were doing they see how were organized they see whether weve got the right sense of urgency so they dont just sit in their offices and wait for us to send them something and then they study it and react theyre there side by side with us and we have extremely active dialogue with them as all big banks do and for us thats a good thing because we want them to see what were doing how were doing it and how its different than we tackled these issues in the past my experience has been when we ask them something very specific or when we give them something and submit something to them theyre thorough but theyre very timely in their response how that actually plays out with a consent order again i dont know what were focused on is doing the work having them see the progress and hopefully the work will be done to our satisfaction and their satisfaction and well move forward at the right time wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you for the insight appreciate it charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator our final question will come from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hey guys charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey john john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research couple of quick cleanups here wrapping up john just on the cet1 how much does that change impact cet1 the rwa the new measurement any idea just kind of framework of how much that hits john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co yeah well you can see in the deck what the comparisons have been for the last those measurement points i mean today theyre basically on top of each other the question is what happens to rwa as internal risk ratings change with the passage of time and so we expect to be well above our minimums our own targets et cetera its not really an issue but if it pops around by tens of basis points or something we just want people to know that thats the regulatory framework that were operating in theres nothing new or different about the credit risk in these loans its accounted for in our allowance weve always been or weve been a standardized constrained bank since this regulatory regime came into place and now that might change for a period of time as we work through the pandemic but i dont anticipate it being that meaningful and its the same dollars of capital protecting the same book of loans john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay okay got it and then just one more on the nii for the fourth quarter is your guidance implying that niis relatively flat to the third quarter john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co yeah its flattish i dont think we have specific guidance but i wouldnt expect it to move around that much in the quarter wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then if you operated at the fourth quarter annualized if we annualized that next year and compared that to the billion for this year thatd be down midsingle digits so i got a couple of questions so people are asking how would it be flat yearoveryear its like youd have to have a loan growth right for it to be flat and you have an asset cap john richard shrewsberry a chief financial officer senior executive vp wells fargo co yes it has to have loan growth or a steepening in redeployment a handful of things would have to go right for it to be flat so thats why i think thats a reasonable range of expectation flat to down midsingle digits and well give more clarity on that as the budget process is complete and we get closer to the beginning of the year but those are the drivers john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then the last thing just for charlie charlie just to kind of clarify what youre hoping to do on communications in the timeline so in january youll give us some expense guidance for once youve gotten to think through that some more so well get an expense guide for next year in january but in terms of kind of the further details like longerterm aspirations for roe and efficiency and longterm cost potential is that going to be later on and that depends if you can just clarify what the time frames are for road maps thatd be great charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i think it depends on whether how much work weve done over the multiyear period in having bottomsup supportable plans that we have the confidence to share john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yes charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co where we are in covid and ultimately thinking about the interest rate environment as well because clearly as we think about our efficiency ratio revenue these days has a very meaningful impact but as we do our work on expenses the work were taking actions you see that in the charge this quarter and the reserves that we provided for these actions will be taken this year and so youll see the positive impact next year and so the actions that were building are very real its a question of when it all comes together in terms of understanding the regulatory piece the necessary investment piece and the expense cuts so again i think we just have to take it one quarter a time and understand that people want to see progress on a net basis john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it okay thanks wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 operator ill now turn the conference back over for any further remarks charles william scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co
