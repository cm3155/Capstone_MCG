executive officer director wells fargo co thanks john ill make some brief comments about our third quarter results and update you on our priorities ill then turn the call over to mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions let me start with some third quarter highlights our results were solid with billion of net income diluted earnings per share and roe of and an rotce of all were up from the second quarter our earnings profile is very different than it was five years ago as weve been making strategic investments in many of our businesses and deemphasizing or selling others our revenue sources are more diverse and our fee based revenue has grown during the first nine months of the year largely offsetting the net interest income headwinds we have faced over the last year we have maintained strong credit discipline and driven significant operating efficiencies in the company while investing heavily to build a risk and control infrastructure appropriate for a bank of our size and complexity headcount has declined every quarter for four years and was down since the third quarter of our expenses in the third quarter were down from both the second quarter and a year ago average loans declined from the second quarter as we have maintained strong credit standards and are focused on returns over volume weve continued to grow our credit card portfolio with balances growing for consecutive quarters and commercial loan demand remains weak reflecting economic uncertainty and the expectation that rates will be lower in the future overall deposits declined slightly from the second quarter but deposit balances at our customerfacing businesses continue to grow which has enabled us to reduce higher cost corporate treasury deposits weve started to reduce deposit pricing in response to the recent fed rate cuts and were closely monitoring marketing conditions and will continue to make adjustments both our consumer and commercial customers have remained resilient in our wholesale businesses credit performance improved from the second quarter with lower losses in both our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loan portfolios the office market remains weak and we continue to expect additional chargeoffs in our commercial real estate office portfolio and have accordingly maintained strong allowance coverage overall customers in our consumer businesses continue to hold up relatively well benefiting from the strong labor market and wage growth consumer chargeoffs declined in the second quarter driven by lower losses in our credit card portfolio while our other consumer portfolios continued to perform well reflecting the benefit of prior credit tightening actions we continue to look for changes in consumer health but we have not seen meaningful changes in trends when looking at delinquency statistics across our consumer credit portfolios both credit card and debit card spend were up in the third quarter from a year ago and although the pace of growth has slowed it is still healthy we continue to see more pronounced stress in certain customer segments with lower deposit and asset levels where inflation has partially offset strong employment and wage growth the benefits of inflation slowing and interest rates starting to ease should be helpful to all customers but especially those on the lower end of the income scale wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 our capital position remains strong with our cet1 ratio of up from last quarter and we continue to return significant amounts of excess capital to shareholders we repurchased billion common stock in the quarter and billion of common stock during the first quarters of this year up over from a year ago and we increased our common stock dividend in the third quarter by shareholders have meaningfully benefited from our capital management actions as our earnings per share are up over since the third quarter of benefiting from the decline in diluted average common shares over the same period now let me update you on our strategic priorities starting with our risk and control work which remains our top priority we continue to move forward with confidence and believe we have the right culture team discipline and sense of urgency to complete the work thats required that includes what is required under the recent formal agreement we entered with the office of the comptroller of the currency we are also continuing to execute on our other strategic priorities we continue to build our credit card business and this past quarter we launched two new cobranded credit cards with expedia which provide our customers a unique travel rewards program with instant discounts enhanced perks and accelerated rewards our broader set of credit card products continue to be wellreceived by both existing customers and customers new to wells fargo with nearly million new credit cards accounts this year last month we announced a multiyear cobranded agreement with volkswagen financial services starting in the first half of next year we will be the preferred purchase financing provider for volkswagen and audi brands in the united states the investments weve been making in our consumer small and business banking segment are starting to generate growth after several years of no growth net checking accounts have now grown for three consecutive quarters and we believe our debit card share has started to increase as well mobile active users increased by million or from last year we are also investing our branches and have refurbished over branches during the first three quarters of this year we continue to hire proven leaders in our corporate investment bank in investment banking we made several important hires focused on key coverage and product groups to help us build on our momentum and grow the business we also hired a new vice chair of corporate banking who is focused on helping us continue to expand and grow that franchise we also continued to track experienced leaders in other areas and in the third quarter bridget engle joined wells fargo as head of technology reporting to me ive worked with bridget in the past and know firsthand how her deep experience leading largescale technology transformations at large global financial institutions will benefit wells fargo our strategic priorities also include focusing on businesses that are core to our consumer and corporate clients and when they arent shrinking or selling them as part of this effort during the third quarter we announced wed entered into a definitive agreement to sell the nonagency thirdparty servicing segment of our commercial mortgage servicing business we will continue servicing agency loans and loans held on our balance sheet looking ahead overall the us economy remains strong with inflation slowing and a resilient labor market boosting income and supporting consumer spending company balance sheets are strong contributing to both consumption and investment in the economy but slowing demand for commercial lending we continue to be prepared for a variety of economic environments and well balance our desire to increase returns and grow while protecting the downside we have one of the most enviable franchises in the industry and a top management team capable of delivering strong results i want to thank everyone who i worked with at wells fargo for everything theyve done to transform this great company i will now turn the call over to mike wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 michael p santomassimo chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co thank you charlie and good morning everyone we are pleased with the results in the third quarter we again saw good growth in noninterest income across most businesses and expenses were well controlled net income for the third quarter was billion or per diluted common share during the quarter we took the opportunity to reposition a portion of the investment securities portfolio our results included million or per share of net losses on the sale of debt securities this included the sale of approximately billion of securities and reinvestment of the proceeds into securities with yields approximately basis points higher than the securities we sold the estimated earnback period for this repositioning is a little over two years without the impact of the investment securities portfolio repositioning earnings per share would have been when looking at our results compared with a year ago id remind you that our third quarter results last year included million or per share of discrete tax benefits turning to slide net interest income declined million or from the second quarter million of this decline was due to the increased pricing on sweep deposits in advisory brokerage accounts in wealth and investment management that we highlighted on last quarters call this was the lowest linked quarter decline in net interest income since third quarter as customer migration to higher yielding deposit products continued to slow and the pace of deposit pricing increases also decelerated deposit costs were up basis points in the third quarter with approximately half of this increase driven by the pricing increase on sweep deposits in advisory brokerage accounts the third quarter increase in deposit costs was lower than the basis point increase in the second quarter and the basis point rise in the first quarter in response to the federal reserve rate cut in september we have reduced rates on promotional deposit offers in our consumer businesses pricing on sweep deposits in advisory brokerage accounts which are aligned to money market funds will continue to move in line with fed rate cuts commercial deposit pricing has responded quickly to federal reserve rate reductions just as it did when rates were rising we are continuously monitoring competitive conditions and deposit trends and will adjust pricing ph tenor and ebalance requirements based on our observations we highlight loans and deposits on slide average loans were down from both the second quarter and a year ago with continued growth in credit card loan balances more than offset by declines in most other categories ill highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results average deposits increased billion from a year ago and growth in our customer deposits enabled us to reduce higher cost corporate treasury deposits average deposits were down billion in the second quarter this decline was driven by billion reduction in higher cost corporate treasury deposits while customer deposits grew billion from the second quarter all else equal a reduction in corporate treasury deposits is a positive for net interest income in the current environment turning to noninterest income on slide we had strong growth in noninterest income up from a year ago as charlie highlighted this growth reflects the benefit of the investments weve been making in our businesses as well as market conditions we grew noninterest income across most categories including doubledigit increases year over year in many of our largest feegenerating activities including investment advisory net gains from trading activities deposit related fees and investment banking we also benefited from improved results in our venture capital investments i will highlight the specific drivers in noninterest income growth when discussing our operating segment results wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 turning to expenses on slide noninterest expense declined from both the second quarter and a year ago the impact of our efficiency initiatives helps reduce salaries and professional and outside services expense compared with a year ago these declines were partially offset by higher revenue related compensation predominantly in wealth and investment management as well as higher technology and equipment expense operating losses declined from a year ago and from the higher levels we had in the first half of this year turning to credit quality on slide net loan chargeoffs decreased basis points from the second quarter to basis points of average loans the decline was driven by lower commercial net loan chargeoffs which were down million from the second quarter to basis points of average loans with lower losses in both our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial portfolios while losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio declined in the third quarter market fundamentals remain weak and we still expect commercial real estate office losses to be lumpy as we continue to actively work with our clients consumer net loan chargeoffs declined million from the second quarter to basis points of average loans driven by lower losses in the credit card portfolio nonperforming assets decreased from the second quarter driven by lower commercial real estate nonaccrual loans commercial real estate office nonaccruals declined million which included paydowns and net loan chargeoffs moving to slide our allowance for credit losses for loans was down million in the second quarter with modest declines across most asset classes largely offset by an increase in allowance for credit card loans driven by higher balances our allowance coverage for loans has been relatively stable over the past year as credit trends remain within our expectations our allowance coverage for our corporate and investment banking and commercial real estate office portfolio has also been relatively stable at approximately since third quarter of turning to capital liquidity on slide our capital position remains strong and our cet1 ratio of continue to be well above our new cet1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of which became effective in the fourth quarter the increase in our cet1 ratio from the second quarter included a benefit of basis points from higher accumulated other comprehensive income due to lower interest rates and tighter mortgagebacked security spreads with the billion of common stock repurchased in the third quarter our share repurchases during the first three quarters this year were billion higher than in the same period a year ago and diluted average shares outstanding declined from a year ago turning to our operating segment results starting with consumer banking and lending on slide consumer small and business banking revenue declined from a year ago driven by lower deposit balances and the impact of customers migrating to higher yielding deposit products however the pace of migration continued to slow the slight increase in home lending revenue from a year ago was driven by higher mortgage banking fees credit card revenue declined from a year ago as lower fee revenue more than offset higher net interest income auto revenue decreased from a year ago driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression the decline in personal lending revenue from a year ago was also driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression turning to some key business drivers on slide retail mortgage originations declined from a year ago reflecting the progress weve made on simplifying the home lending business but grew in the second quarter we also continued to make progress on reducing the size of our servicing business the amount of thirdparty mortgage loans serviced was down from a year ago wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 since we announced our new strategy early last year we reduced head count from lending by the size of our auto portfolio continued decline with periodend loan balances down from a year ago driven by previous credit tightening actions origination volume in the third quarter was stable year over year and grew in the second quarter debit card spending increased billion or from a year ago and credit card spending was up from a year ago with growth in all categories except fuel payment rates were modestly lower than a year ago but remained above prepandemic levels turning to commercial banking results on slide middle market banking revenue was down from a year ago driven by lower net interest income reflecting higher deposit costs partially offset by growth in treasury management fees assetbased lending and leasing revenue decreased from a year ago driven by lower net interest income and lease income partially offset by improved results from equity investments average loan balances in the third quarter were down compared with a year ago loan demand remained weak as many clients remained cautious about investing in inventory buildup and in capital expenditures due to economic uncertainty and high borrowing costs turning to corporate and investment banking on slide banking revenue was down from a year ago driven by higher deposit costs and lower loan balances commercial real estate revenue decreased from a year ago reflecting the impact of lower loan balances partially offset by higher capital markets revenue markets revenue increased from a year ago driven by strong performance in rates structured products and municipals partially offset by lower revenue in equities average loans declined from a year ago driven by continued reduction in our commercial real estate portfolio and lower loan balances and banking as clients continue to access capital markets funding on slide wealth and investment management revenue increased compared with a year ago due to higher assetbased fees driven by increased market valuations as well as higher brokerage transaction activity partially offset by lower net interest income driven by the increased pricing on sweep deposits in advisory brokerage accounts as a reminder the majority of wim advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter so fourth quarter results will reflect market valuations as of october which were up from both a year ago and from july slide highlights our corporate results revenue declined a year ago driven by net losses on debt securities related to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio partially offset by improved results from our venture capital investments turning to our outlook for net interest income and noninterest expense on slide we currently expect fourth quarter net interest income to be roughly in line with the third quarter of which would imply an approximately decline in full year net interest income compared with based on this expectation we believe we are close to the trough however exactly when this occurs will be influenced by a variety of factors including the pace of fed rate changes deposit mix and pricing and day count turning to expenses we still expect full year noninterest expense to be approximately billion which has not changed from our guidance last quarter as a reminder we have outstanding litigation regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year in summary we had solid results in third quarter which demonstrated the progress we were making to transform wells fargo and improve our returns we grew noninterest income by from a year ago with growth across most businesses we achieved this doubledigit growth even with the million loss we took to reposition the investment securities portfolio which will start to benefit our results in the fourth quarter wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 while this growth in noninterest income was more than offset by an expected decline in net interest income the investments we have made in our businesses to drive better fee income and diversify our revenue were evident we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives with expenses down from a year ago and head count down for consecutive quarters our results also reflected our credit discipline and strong capital position which has enabled us to return more than billion to shareholders over the past year through common stock dividends and share repurchases and while we are pleased with the progress weve made we are even more excited about the additional opportunity we have throughout all the businesses to continue to improve our results we will now take your questions question and answer section operator at this time we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question will come from scott siefers of piper sandler sir please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everybody thank you for taking the question mike i was hoping to start with nii so your fourth quarter number should be flattish with the third quarter level and i believe you mentioned toward the end of your prepared remarks that you believe wells is sort of close to the trough was hoping you could just unpack please a bit more what you see is the swing the main swing factors either way as well as kind of what it might take from here for it to begin to inflect back upward more visibly michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah scott no i appreciate the question so i mean its the same drivers weve been talking about now for the last number of quarters so obviously deposits and the mix of those deposits is going to be a big factor in the near term i think as you can see in our trend that nib deposits were behaving pretty well i will note though in the trend that there is a product switch conversion that we did that sort of impacted nibs and ibs so if you take that out the percentage of noninterestbearing deposits is effectively flat to the third quarter and so thats the first time now in a while where weve seen that be the case and so thats one of the factors that well have to see sort of play out for a little bit longer time period but so far so good in terms of that trend participating in the way we thought or behaving in the way we thought obviously deposit pricing as rates come back down is going to be a big factor if you look at as i said in my remarks on the consumer side weve already adjusted the promo rates as well as cds those will continue to adjust as rates move were seeing exactly what we thought we would see on the most interest ratesensitive deposits so on the commercial side as rates started to come down the betas are exactly what we thought and are pretty high for those deposits so thats working obviously we havent seen any loan growth but we werent expecting that but thatll be a factor as you sort of look a little bit longer time period and then this is a little bit in the weeds but as you sort of look at the first wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 quarter you do have day counts and things to kind of adjust for so you could bounce around a little bit depending on the quarter based on factors like that as well r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then you touched i appreciate that then you touched on loan demand as a factor as well you all have been pretty reserved regarding that backdrop throughout the year which has been borne out to be correct i guess hopefully were beginning to get some clarity on some of the unresolved issues like cost to borrow and i guess were getting closer to the election maybe just some additional thoughts on the overall outlook there if possible please michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah no i think i mean you hit on a couple of the things that people are thinking about but based on the conversations our teams are having with clients i think people are still being very prudent about borrowing i think the basis point reduction is helpful but not by itself a factor that will drive people to borrow or not i think theyll need to see that come down more meaningfully if thats like the driving force the uncertainty around the election the uncertainty around just macro backdrop i think as people get more confidence that base line case of a soft landing will materialize you get past the election you see rates come down a little bit i think all those things will come together and help give clients more confidence about either building inventories or making further capital expenditures that theyre holding off on now so i think youve got to see a few of those things come together and as you say as we get closer to the end of the year youll start to get a little bit more visibility there and well see as it goes r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you very much operator the next question will come from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open sir ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess the first question i think charlie addressed this a little bit in his opening remarks around expenses and i appreciate youre not talking about today but big picture looking at your slide personnel expenses flat million yearoveryear noncomp flat million yearoveryear from a shareholder perspective and given what youve said is it fair to assume we continue to see some of this flatlining trend where there are enough wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 savings to reinvest in the platform grow fee revenues and do all the stuff that youre doing but without seeing a meaningful change in these two categories as we look forward charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co ebrahim this is charlie i guess id just repeat what weve said in the past which is we think that there continue to be meaningful efficiencies around the company but we also are investing in both spending whatever we need to spend in the risk and regulatory space as well as investing for the future and when we get to next quarter well talk about and we just dont want to get ahead of ourselves because thats something that we think weve done a good job of balancing historically and will continue to balance it going forward in our thinking and when weve got specifics to share well share it michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co and ebrahim id just maybe put out one other thing as you look at things like personnel expense obviously theres lots that go underneath that so we are seeing the efficiency come through on salaries and other items and thats offset by revenuerelated expense mostly in the wealth and investment management business and so thats a good thing right so you may see that bounce around but underneath that is the efficiency really coming through as head count continues to come down i think weve all probably pointed it out that head count came down again in the quarter so were continuing to execute on that part of the efficiency agenda as well as all the other nonpersonnel expenses charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co but again i dont think our thinking has changed about efficiency opportunities but also opportunities to invest in so we just need to go through our own internal process as we think about and when we finish that well will share it ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just maybe one quick mike im sorry if i missed it on nii its an assetsensitive balance sheet because of september basis points cut i would have assumed fourth quarter nii would have declined and maybe theres about million of bond book restructuring help just why is nii not going down despite the basis points cut and is there more room for additional restructuring as we look forward thank you michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah i mean look its just a confluence of all the factors that come together right around sort of whats happening with the mix of deposits our mix is a little bit different obviously than others i think the pricing actions we took across the deposit base help as you look into the fourth quarter as well and then obviously weve got assets continue to kind of reprice up weve got the repositioning but also just normal reinvestment as we see maturities roll i think on repositioning weve been sort of repositioning the portfolio for a while well continue to look at it nothing on the horizon right now but well continue to look at it as we always do and well let you know if we decide to do more wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and the only thing id add is when you think about just rate movement you need to look at the different points along the curve ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it the steeper the better i assume michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co steeper is ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co generally better over a period of time yeah ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah thanks for taking my questions michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yes thank you operator the next question will come from erika najarian of ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning my first question is could you remind us based on your understanding what happens next after you submit your thirdparty review to the fed as it relates to the asset cap work stream charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well so just the way consent orders work ill it answer very generally because we dont talk about anything specific relative to where we are or what the timing is we havent and we wont is you get a consent order we need to do the work to develop a very detailed plan regulators then look at that plan and give us feedback on the plan we execute on that plan and whatever is required in that submission when were done with the work we submit it to them and then they have done some work along the way but they generally do a review after the submission and then theyve got a wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 series of formal processes that they need to go through to make the decision on whether the work has been done to their satisfaction and when thats done we find out about it and you find out about it erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and as a followup you bought back billion of shares in the third quarter mike is this about the pace that we should expect until we get your next scb in june im just trying to think about framing the buyback opportunity over next few quarters michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah erika we dont really talk about quartertoquarter pace but i think if you look at where we stand from a capital perspective were basis points over the new reg minimum plus buffers of so we go into this environment with plenty of excess capital were going to generate more capital obviously through earnings as we go and then we go through the normal process that we go through every quarter to look at sort of the opportunities we have to help support clients we look at the risks that are out there and then well decide on exact pacing sort of as we go but were happy that we were able to buy back billion so far yeartodate and continuing to give excess capital back to shareholders is something thats top of mind for us erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator the next question will come from betsy graseck of morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey so first question just want to understand if the asset cap were to be removed well i should say when the asset cap is removed right are there opportunities for you to lean in anywhere in terms of asset growth because ive heard you in the past several times and i would assume its same today that the asset cap is not keeping you from doing anything that you want to do and maybe thats wrong but just want to understand where you would lean in when it does get removed charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 sure mike ill start and then you can either amplify or change if you disagree with anything i say i think what we see and what we have talked a little bit about is the places where we have been the most careful about the assets and our liabilities today is around on the wholesale deposit side theres certainly been places where wed have to be very careful about not bringing on significant deposits because we want to make sure that weve got the room to serve customers elsewhere both relative to their borrowing needs as well as consumer deposits and obviously when commercial deposits come in it brings cash with it the other place has been in our markets business where we actually have since the asset cap has been in existence weve not just limited but reduced somewhat the financing abilities that we have for our customers so those are the two places where wed probably see the impact immediately not incredibly significant changes by any stretch of the imagination but weve been had to be very very careful in those two places and then beyond that its just normal growth opportunities that we would see across all the different parts of the company betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and on the expense side youve talked in the past about the billion that has been invested to address the issues in the consent order and to deal with them when the consent order goes away is there an opportunity to pull back on that at all charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co were not even honestly we literally arent even thinking about that we still have more work to do weve said that that is the most important thing at some point can we become more efficient in some of the things absolutely but whats most important is from our standpoint to make sure that the things weve built become part of the culture of the company so its just not when we think about efficiencies we think about there are plenty of other places for us to drive efficiencies and not focus on those activities at this point betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks so much charlie charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yes operator the next question will come from matt oconnor of deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i was hoping you guys could talk about the anti money laundering kyc the disclosure indiscernible regulatory outcome on that and given that it was in your 10q and so public wondering if you could just add some color around it and then also just what it might mean to expenses and anything else we should be mindful of going forward thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 yeah i mean we put out something when we entered into the formal agreement with the occ and like other things that we find and they find we take them extremely seriously were going to get the work done as ive said in my prepared remarks i think as we identify issues and we see that there are things that have to get built weve got confidence that weve got the ability to do it i would say relative to the cost around it id say the two different pieces which is just like all of the controlrelated work were going to spend whatever is necessary at this point as we sit and look at the billion expense base dont see it having anything meaningfully that we need to talk about beyond our ability to spend as weve discussed and i would also mention that and i think weve said something about this which is a significant amount of the work that is required in the consent order weve been working on and so as we think about what were spending were spending a significant amount of money relative to whats necessary in that order already matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then are you able to comment is this kind of a wells specific thing or an industrywide kind of area focus because we know the banks are responsible not just for kind of policing their customers but really keeping track of all the money thats moving around it seems like it could be a broader focus on that charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co were not going to speak and we speak for ourselves and what we know beyond that is not right or appropriate matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator the next question will come from david long of raymond james your line is open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone i just wanted to follow up with the regulatory side and can you remind us of the mechanics of the asset cap without providing any insights as to when you think it may come off but can the asset cap be removed in your opinion without the consent order being removed completely charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co listen i would for anyone who is if you have questions on the fed consent order its very readable its something like i dont remember exactly but its like five pages seven pages mike is telling me of which there are like theres a page in there which is really the page that lays out what we have to accomplish and how the fed is going to look at things so it really is very digestible so ill give you a brief summary but again please id point you back to it if you want to go through it were required to the board needs to be more effective we need to build out operational risk and compliance in the company to lift the asset cap that work needs to be adopted and implemented and to lift the entire consent order it needs to be effective and sustainable and so thats whats laid out the way the fed will interpret those things and relative to things going on in the company is certainly their bailiwick as ive said were very focused wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 on getting the work done and feel good about our ability to get it done given what weve shown that we can do here david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you charlie appreciate it and then the other question i had was related to the trading gains line and youve been putting up over billion there per quarter in trading gains what are some of the puts and takes in that line that can create some volatility on a quartertoquarter basis michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah ill its mike ill take that obviously volatility in the market is a big factor so its kind of the market conditions that we operate in you generally have some seasonality to that line item as well but in the third and fourth quarter as you get through the holiday season and then i think where we have been focused there is really just continuing to methodically improve the capabilities make sure we have the right people in the right seats we continue to improve all of our technology and etrading capabilities and were seeing good results of that but its something that can move around based on market conditions quite a bit but our focus is just to make sure that we continue to have the right capabilities to serve clients and weve been pleased now that weve strung together probably seven quarters of pretty good performance there and we look forward to what happens going forward david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc great thanks mike thanks for taking my questions thanks operator the next question will come from john pancari of evercore your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning just around the a little bit more around the securities repositioning how much of a benefit to ph managers income did the securities repositioning have this quarter and how much of a would it be a full quarter impact that you would expect for the fourth quarter michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co very little in the third quarter its all done so its in the run rate for the fourth quarter john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay and then have you sized up that impact and what it would mean for nii for the fourth quarter michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co its in my remarks where we did about billion of repositioning we picked up about basis points on that so i mean wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay indiscernible michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co obviously youve got day count and other things to adjust but its pretty easy to model john pancari q analyst evercore isi right okay all right thanks and then separately just around the fee income commentary i appreciate the color you provided around the trading outlook can you perhaps unpack the rest of your expectations there just on the fee side how we should think about the trajectory of wealth management and possibly on the card side and ib as well just what youre seeing there in terms of underlying drivers charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well id first i mean there are like underlying drivers right and so you should look at each of the specifics and do your own modeling based upon what you think right weve got credit card revenues weve got trading i mean all these different pieces its just not one monolithic number michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah and maybe i could just give you a couple pieces or color underneath that so obviously on the investment management line market levels matter a lot as weve pointed out about twothirds of that line is equities the rest is fixed income most of that gets priced in advance based on the first day of the quarter last day of the quarter prior quarter so thats a pretty good way to sort of think about that line going forward if you look at card fees as charlie talked about weve got a debit card and credit card business as we sort of see growth across the economy and were successful in growing our business thatll drive that line investment banking is somewhat market dependent but weve been investing there quite a bit and so the goal is to increase market share methodically over time and so those are kind of the biggest pieces of the puzzle there but hopefully thats a little helpful john pancari q analyst evercore isi no that is helpful mike i appreciate you walking through the details there operator and the final question will come from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 hi mike hi charlie can you guys share with us maybe a little color on the commercial real estate office portfolio it looks like this stabilization may be setting in on the credit quality any indicators of is it getting less worse or when you go into market property down the marks maybe arent as severe as they were six months or months ago any further details here charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey ill take it its an interesting question because it depends on i think it depends on who you talk to and how you actually ask the question meaning when we look at whats actually happening things arent getting better and it is kind of more of the same but its impacting more properties maybe to some extent theres a little bit of contagion to properties that are fairly well leased but people looking for better deals because they think theres weakness out there so you may see a little bit of that but what you see is just more of the significant revaluation because of supply and demand thats going on as these properties kind of move through the cycle so as we look at it our kind of big picture is based upon what we expected there arent material changes at all were actually seeing that play out but things are getting worse because there are more properties being impacted so it depends on whether its versus your expectations or what youve seen in the prior period michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah and gerard maybe ill just add one other piece so its the same were seeing the same kind of trend where kind of new buildings renovated buildings in good locations are doing fine its older office buildings pretty consistent across the us but as charlie said its within the expectations weve had which we were pretty down on the space now for a while and so its playing out kind of largely within that range of what we thought and as i have said over and over like its going to take a while to play out this is not something that will take a quarter or two and be over itll play out over a longer period of time and we feel really good about our allowance for coverage ratio we feel like thats more than appropriate for kind of what we expect to see here and were going to continue to work with clients as best we can to grow it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then i know gosh its only been less than a month since the fed cut the fed funds rate and obviously the forward curve is calling for more and you guys as you addressed in your prepared remarks mike about deposit costs the behavior i know again its early but any comments on are you seeing the consumers and the corporate customers behaving as expected in terms of what theyre doing with their deposits with lower rates and as the second part of that question with your loantodeposit ratio not being very high of course is there more room for you to lower deposit costs and not have to be as concerned being overlevered michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co id say like the short answer on the behavior side is not much has changed in the last three weeks the trend though that we have seen now for the better part of the yearish is that weve seen less migration to higher yielding alternatives weve seen good stabilization deposits across the businesses those trends are all still true and were not seeing that shift in any significant way in any of the businesses at this point i think as you look at both deposit pricing and the other side of the equation that you sort of brought up on the loan side we feel its really important to have very consistent approach to underwriting credit over a long period of time and thats kind of what weve been doing and i think that served us well and i think thats going to continue to be the approach wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 on the deposit side i think well make the decisions we think are the right decisions productbyproduct and clientbyclient based on the relationships we have and so far again thats worked out well for us so thats the approach were going to continue to take gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great i appreciate the color and candor thank you michael p santomassimo chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells
