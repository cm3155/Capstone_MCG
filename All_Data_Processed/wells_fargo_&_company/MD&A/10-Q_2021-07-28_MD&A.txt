assetliability risks see the risk management assetliability management section in our form 10k interest rate risk interest rate risk is created in our role as a financial intermediary for customers based on investments such as loans and other extensions of credit and debt securities interest rate risk can have a significant impact to our earnings we are subject to interest rate risk because assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising earnings will initially increase assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts shortterm and longterm market interest rates may change by different amounts for example the shape of the yield curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs differently the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change for example if longterm mortgage interest rates increase sharply mbs held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated which could impact portfolio income or wells fargo company risk management assetliability management continued interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand collateral values credit losses mortgage origination volume and the fair value of msrs and other financial instruments we assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under various net interest income simulations using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes the degree of change over time the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve these simulations require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations prepayment speeds on loans and debt securities deposit flows and mix as well as pricing strategies our most recent simulations as presented in table estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next months using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario steeper and flatter scenarios measure nonparallel changes in the yield curve with longterm interest rates defined as all tenors three years and longer eg 10year us treasury securities and shortterm interest rates defined as all tenors less than three years where applicable us dollar interest rates are floored at the following describes the simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in table simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our assets and liabilities other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with the changes in interest rates are held constant mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory deposit mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across the alternative scenarios in higher interest rate scenarios customer activity that shifts balances into higheryielding products could reduce expected net interest income we hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities portfolios constant across scenarios table net interest income sensitivity in billions parallel shift bps shift in interest rates bps shift in interest rates steeper yield curve jun dec bps shift in longterm interest rates flatter yield curve bps shift in shortterm interest rates bps shift in longterm interest rates the interest rate sensitivity included in table indicates that we would expect to benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities while in the case of lower interest rates our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower

capital planning and stress testing our planned longterm capital structure is designed to meet regulatory and market expectations we believe that our long term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow our business satisfy our customers financial needs in varying environments access markets and maintain flexibility to return capital to our shareholders our longterm targeted capital structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital requirements including the gsib capital surcharge accordingly we currently target a longterm cet1 capital ratio that is basis points above our regulatory requirement plus an incremental buffer of to basis points our capital targets are subject to change based on various factors including changes to the regulatory capital framework and expectations for large banks promulgated by bank regulatory agencies changes to the regulatory requirements for our capital ratios planned capital actions changes in our risk profile and other factors the frb capital plan rule establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases by certain bhcs including wells fargo the frb assesses among other things the overall financial condition risk profile and capital adequacy of bhcs when evaluating their capital plans on march the frb announced that it was extending measures it previously announced limiting large bhcs including wells fargo from making any capital distribution excluding any capital distribution arising from the issuance of a capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio unless otherwise approved by the frb the frb generally authorized bhcs to i provided that the bhc does not increase the amount of its common stock dividends to wells fargo company be larger than the level paid in second quarter pay common stock dividends and make share repurchases that in the aggregate do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the bhcs net income for the four preceding calendar quarters ii make share repurchases that equal the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation and iii redeem and make scheduled payments on additional tier and tier capital instruments these limitations on capital distributions ended on june concurrently with ccar federal banking regulators also require large bhcs and banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions in june the company completed the ccar stress test process on july the board approved an increase to the companys third quarter common stock dividend to per share additionally our capital plan includes gross common share repurchases of approximately billion for the fourquarter period beginning third quarter through second quarter securities repurchases from time to time the board authorizes the company to repurchase shares of our common stock although we announce when the board authorizes share repurchases we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares various factors determine the amount of our share repurchases including our capital requirements the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions market conditions including the trading price of our stock and regulatory and legal considerations including under the frbs capital plan rule due to the various factors that may impact the amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations under our capital plan our share repurchases occur at various price levels we may suspend share repurchase activity at any time at june we had remaining board authority to repurchase approximately million shares subject to regulatory and legal conditions for additional information about share repurchases during second quarter see part ii item in this report regulatory matters the us financial services industry is subject to significant regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives this regulation and oversight may continue to impact how us financial services companies conduct business and may continue to result in increased regulatory compliance costs for a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the company see the overview section in this report the following supplements our discussion of the other significant regulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our business contained in the regulatory matters and risk factors sections in our form 10k living will requirements and related matters rules adopted by the frb and the fdic under the doddfrank act require large financial institutions including wells fargo to prepare and periodically submit resolution plans also known as living wills that would facilitate their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure under the rules rapid and orderly resolution means a reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the us bankruptcy code that can be accomplished in a reasonable period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the united states in addition to the companys resolution plan our national bank subsidiary wells fargo bank na the bank is also required to prepare and periodically submit a resolution plan if the frb andor fdic determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies they may impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth activities or operations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies if the frb andor fdic ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any deficiencies they could require us to divest certain assets or operations on june we submitted our most recent resolution plan to the frb and fdic if wells fargo were to fail it may be resolved in a bankruptcy proceeding or if certain conditions are met under the resolution regime created by the doddfrank act known as the orderly liquidation authority the orderly liquidation authority allows for the appointment of the fdic as receiver for a systemically important financial institution that is in default or in danger of default if among other things the resolution of the institution under the us bankruptcy code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states if the fdic is appointed as receiver for wells fargo company the parent then the orderly liquidation authority rather than the us bankruptcy code would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of our security holders the fdics orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before us taxpayers are exposed to any losses and allows the fdic to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the us bankruptcy code in certain circumstances the strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is a single point of entry strategy in which the parent would likely be the only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings however we are not obligated to maintain a single point of entry strategy and the strategy described in our resolution plan is not binding in the event of an actual resolution of wells fargo whether conducted under the us bankruptcy code or by the fdic under the orderly liquidation authority the fdic has announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly liquidation authority but not all aspects of how the fdic might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible to facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important financial institutions in case of material distress or failure federal banking regulations require that institutions such as wells fargo maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries federal banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding the failure of their parent companies such as limitations on parent guarantees and have issued guidance encouraging institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an orderly resolution in response to the regulators guidance and to facilitate the orderly resolution of the company on june the parent entered into a support agreement as amended wells fargo company in addition to our resolution plans we must also prepare and submit to the frb a recovery plan that identifies a range of options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without extraordinary government support recovery options include the possible sale transfer or disposal of assets securities loan portfolios or businesses the bank must also prepare and submit to the occ a recovery plan that sets forth the banks plan to remain a going concern when the bank is experiencing considerable financial or operational stress but has not yet deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resolution is imminent if either the frb or the occ determines that our recovery plan is deficient they may impose fines restrictions on our business or ultimately require us to divest assets regulatory matters continued and restated on june the support agreement with wfc holdings llc an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the parent the ihc the bank wells fargo securities llc wfs wells fargo clearing services llc wfcs and certain other subsidiaries of the parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes the covered entities or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan the related support entities pursuant to the support agreement the parent transferred a significant amount of its assets including the majority of its cash deposits liquid securities and intercompany loans but excluding its equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain other assets to the ihc and will continue to transfer those types of assets to the ihc from time to time in the event of our material financial distress or failure the ihc will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital andor liquidity to the bank wfs wfcs and the covered entities pursuant to the support agreement under the support agreement the ihc will also provide funding and liquidity to the parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit which together with the issuance of dividends is expected to provide the parent during business as usual operating conditions with the same access to cash necessary to service its debts pay dividends repurchase its shares and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets if certain liquidity and or capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if the parents board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the us bankruptcy code the subordinated notes would be forgiven the committed line of credit would terminate and the ihcs ability to pay dividends to the parent would be restricted any of which could materially and adversely impact the parents liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if the support agreement were not implemented the respective obligations under the support agreement of the parent the ihc the bank and the related support entities are secured pursuant to a related security agreement wells fargo company critical
