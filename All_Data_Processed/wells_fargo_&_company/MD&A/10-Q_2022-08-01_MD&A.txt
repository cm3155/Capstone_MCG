management section in our form 10k interest rate risk interest rate risk is created in our role as a financial intermediary for customers based on investments such as loans and other extensions of credit and debt securities interest rate risk can have a significant impact to our earnings we are subject to interest rate risk because assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising earnings will initially increase assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts shortterm and longterm market interest rates may change by different amounts for example the shape of the yield curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs differently the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change for example if longterm mortgage interest rates increase sharply mbs held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated which could impact portfolio income or interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand collateral values credit losses mortgage origination volume and the fair value of msrs and other financial instruments we assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under various net interest income simulations using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes the degree of change over time the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve these simulations require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations prepayment rates on loans and debt securities deposit flows and mix as well as pricing strategies our most recent simulations as presented in table estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next months using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario steeper and flatter scenarios measure nonparallel changes in the yield curve with longterm interest rates defined as all tenors three years and longer and shortterm interest rates defined as all tenors less than three years where applicable us dollar interest rates are floored at the following describes the simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in table simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our assets and liabilities other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with the changes in interest rates are held constant mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory deposit mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across the alternative scenarios in higher interest rate scenarios customer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher yielding products could impact expected net interest income wells fargo company the interest rate sensitivity of deposits is modeled using the historical behavior of our deposits portfolio and reflects the expectations of deposit products repricing as market interest rates change referred to as deposit betas as well as shifts in the mix of our deposit products our actual experience may differ from expectations due to the lag or acceleration of deposit repricing changes in consumer behavior and other factors we hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities portfolios constant across scenarios table net interest income sensitivity in billions parallel shift bps shift in interest rates bps shift in interest rates steeper yield curve jun dec bps shift in longterm interest rates flatter yield curve bps shift in shortterm interest rates bps shift in longterm interest rates the changes in our interest rate sensitivity from december to june in table reflected updates to our base scenario which included changes in expectations for both balance sheet composition and interest rates our interest rate sensitivity indicates that we would expect to benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities while in the case of lower interest rates our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower net interest income for the december simulations with downward shifts in interest rates the interest rate floor limited the amount of the decline in net interest income we may have a larger decline in net interest income when interest rates increase for the base scenario relative to the interest rate floor the sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest income or expense impacts our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense are primarily driven by mortgage banking activities and may move in the opposite direction of our net interest income see the risk management assetliability management mortgage banking interest rate and market risk section in our form 10k for additional information interest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted by changes in earnings credit for noninterestbearing deposits that reduce treasury management deposit service fees and trading assets which are generally

adequacy liquidity asset quality business mix the level and quality of earnings and rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support for

development in local communities we are a member of the fhlbs based in dallas des moines and san francisco fhlb members are required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock of the applicable fhlb the board of directors of each fhlb can increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the federal housing finance agency because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment in any of the fhlbs depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event the amount of any future investment in the capital stock of the fhlbs is not determinable wells fargo company capital management we have an active program for managing capital through a comprehensive process for assessing the companys overall capital adequacy our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives and to meet both regulatory and market expectations we primarily fund our capital needs through the retention of earnings net of both dividends and share repurchases as well as through the issuance of preferred stock and long and shortterm debt retained earnings at june increased billion from december predominantly as a result of billion of wells fargo net income partially offset by billion of common and preferred stock dividends during the first half of we issued million of common stock substantially all of which was issued in connection with employee compensation and benefits in the first half of we repurchased million shares of common stock at a cost of billion in the first half of our aoci decreased billion predominantly due to net unrealized losses on afs debt securities as interest rates increase changes in the fair value of afs debt securities may negatively affect aoci which lowers the amount of our

categories of assets and offbalance sheet exposures as discussed below riskbased capital and riskweighted assets the company is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement basel iii capital requirements for us banking organizations the rules contain two frameworks for calculating capital requirements a standardized approach and an advanced approach applicable to certain institutions including wells fargo and we must calculate our riskbased capital ratios under both approaches the company is required to satisfy the riskbased capital ratio requirements to avoid

regulations the countercyclical buffer in effect at june was the capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain institutions including wells fargo under the advanced approach and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or financial stress wells fargo company the stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease in a bhcs riskbased capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the frbs annual supervisory stress test and related comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends because the stress capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time our stress capital buffer and thus our riskbased capital ratio requirements under the standardized approach are subject to change

will publish the final stress capital buffer for the period october through september for each bhc by august as a global systemically important bank gsib we are also subject to the frbs rule implementing an additional capital surcharge of between on the riskbased capital ratio requirements of gsibs under the rule we must annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges the first method method one considers our size interconnectedness crossjurisdictional activity substitutability and complexity consistent with the methodology developed by the bcbs and the financial stability board fsb the second method method two uses similar table capital components and ratios inputs but replaces substitutability with use of shortterm wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than under method one because the gsib capital surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years if our annual calculation results in a decrease to our gsib capital surcharge the decrease takes effect the next calendar year if our annual calculation results in an increase to our gsib capital surcharge the increase takes effect in two calendar years for our gsib capital surcharge is under the riskbased capital rules onbalance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and offbalance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor or if relevant the guarantor or the nature of any

summary of significant accounting policies to financial statements in our form 10k are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results six of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions these policies govern the allowance for credit losses the valuation of residential msrs the fair value of financial instruments income taxes liability for contingent litigation losses and goodwill

statements in this report wells fargo company current accounting developments table provides the significant accounting updates applicable to us that have been issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb but are not yet effective table current accounting developments issued standards description and effective date financial statement impact asu financial services insurance topic targeted improvements to the accounting for longduration contracts and subsequent related updates the update effective january requires market risk benefits features of insurance contracts that protect the policyholder from otherthannominal capital market risk and expose the insurer to that risk to be measured at fair value through earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our own credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income the update also requires more frequent updates for insurance assumptions mandates the use of a standardized discount rate for traditional longduration contracts and simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs the most significant impact of adoption relates to reinsurance of variable annuity products for a limited number of our insurance clients our reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts these variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum benefits that require us to make benefit payments for the remainder of the policyholders life once the account values are exhausted these guaranteed minimum benefits meet the definition of market risk benefits and will be measured at fair value the cumulative effect of the difference between fair value and the carrying value upon adoption of the update net of income tax adjustments and excluding the impact of our own credit risk will be recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings in the earliest period presented and will affect our regulatory capital calculations at june our estimated liability related to these guaranteed minimum benefits was approximately million and was associated with approximately billion of policyholder account values we expect future earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits which are sensitive to changes in equity and fixed income markets as well as policyholder behavior and changes in mortality assumptions we plan to economically hedge the market volatility where feasible changes in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long duration contracts and deferred acquisition costs are not expected to be material asu derivatives and hedging topic fair value hedging portfolio layer method the update effective january with early adoption permitted establishes the portfolio layer method which expands an entitys ability to achieve fair value hedge accounting for interest rate risk hedges of closed portfolios of financial assets the update also provides guidance on the accounting for hedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method the update improves our ability to use derivatives to hedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of financial assets such as fixedrate availableforsale debt securities and loans the update allows us to hedge a larger proportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type of derivatives permitted as eligible hedges as well as by increasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both prepayable and nonprepayable assets upon adoption any election to designate portfolio layer method hedges is applied prospectively additionally the update permits a onetime reclassification of debt securities from heldtomaturity to availableforsale classification as long as the securities are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than days after the adoption date we are currently evaluating the impact of the update on our consolidated financial statements asu financial instrumentscredit losses topic troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures the update effective january with early adoption permitted eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings tdrs by creditors and introduces new required disclosures for loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty the update also amends the guidance for vintage disclosures to require disclosure of current period gross chargeoffs by year of origination the update will impact the measurement of the allowance for credit losses acl and require new disclosures related to loan modifications and credit quality specifically the update eliminates the requirement to use a discounted cash flow dcf approach to measure the acl for certain tdrs and instead allows for the use of an expected loss approach for all loans upon adoption we expect to discontinue using a dcf approach for consumer loans and retain a dcf approach for certain nonperforming commercial loans any changes to the acl as a result of the change in tdr measurement will be included as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the beginning of the earliest period presented requires new disclosures for modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness interest rate reduction other than insignificant payment delay term extension or a combination of these modifications requires us to provide current period gross chargeoffs by origination date vintage in our credit quality disclosures on a prospective basis beginning as of the adoption date other
