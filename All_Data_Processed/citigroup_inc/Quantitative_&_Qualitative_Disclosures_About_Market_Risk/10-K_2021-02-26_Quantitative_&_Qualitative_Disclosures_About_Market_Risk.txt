categorize exposures as special mention substandard doubtful or loss risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and adjusted as appropriate the credit review process incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors including financial and nonfinancial disclosures or metrics idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive regulatory or macroeconomic environment this includes but is not limited to exposures in those sectors significantly impacted by the pandemic including consumer retail commercial real estate and transportation citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be appropriately rated and classified as of december since the onset of the pandemic citi has taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and obligorspecific factors have changed particularly where additional stress has been seen as obligor risk ratings are downgraded the probability of default increases downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to result in a higher provision for credit losses in addition downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the incremental credit risk or may result in citis seeking to reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector citi will continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate

businesses funding and liquidity risks arise from several factors many of which are mostly or entirely outside citis control such as disruptions in the financial markets changes in key funding sources credit spreads changes in citis credit ratings and macroeconomic geopolitical and other conditions for additional information see risk factorsliquidity risks above citis funding and liquidity management objectives are aimed at i funding its existing asset base ii growing its core businesses iii maintaining sufficient liquidity structured appropriately so that citi can operate under a variety of adverse circumstances including potential companyspecific andor market liquidity events in varying durations and severity and iv satisfying regulatory requirements including among other things those related to resolution planning for additional information see resolution plan and total lossabsorbing capacity tlac below citigroups primary liquidity objectives are established by entity

global markets japan inc and other bank and nonbank subsidiaries that are consolidated into citigroup including citibanamex at an aggregate citigroup level citis goal is to maintain sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and highquality liquid assets as discussed below even in times of stress in order to meet its payment obligations as they come due the liquidity risk management framework provides that in addition to the aggregate requirements certain entities be selfsufficient or net providers of liquidity including in conditions established under their designated stress tests citis primary funding sources include i corporate and consumer deposits via citis bank subsidiaries including citibank na citibank ii longterm debt primarily senior and subordinated debt mainly issued by citigroup inc as the parent and citibank and iii stockholders equity these sources may be supplemented by shortterm borrowings primarily in the form of secured funding transactions as referenced above citis funding and liquidity framework ensures that the tenor of these funding sources is of sufficient term in relation to the tenor of its asset base the goal of citis assetliability management is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity and tenor in the liability structure relative to the liquidity profile of the assets this reduces the risk that liabilities will become due before assets mature or are monetized this excess liquidity is held primarily in the form of highquality liquid assets hqla as set forth in the table below citis liquidity is managed via a centralized treasury model by treasury in conjunction with regional and incountry treasurers with oversight provided by independent risk management and various asset liability committees alcos at the citigroup region country and business levels pursuant to this approach citis hqla is managed with emphasis on assetliability management and entitylevel liquidity adequacy throughout citi citis cro and chief financial officer cochair citigroups alco which includes citis treasurer and other senior executives the alco sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors portfolio performance for additional information about the alco see risk governanceboard and executive management committees above significant changes to portfolio asset allocations are approved by the alco citi also has other alcos which are established at various organizational levels to ensure appropriate oversight for countries franchise businesses and regions serving as the primary governance committees for managing citis balance sheet and liquidity as a supplement to alco citis funding and liquidity risk committee flrc is a more focused assembly for funding and liquidity risk matters the flrc reviews and discusses the funding and liquidity risk profile of as well as risk management practices for citigroup and citibank and reports its findings and recommendations to each relevant alco as appropriate liquidity monitoring and measurement stress testing liquidity stress testing is performed for each of citis major entities operating subsidiaries andor countries stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position and to identify viable funding alternatives that can be utilized these scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources market triggers such as credit ratings potential uses of funding and macroeconomic geopolitical and other conditions these conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as companyspecific events liquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons and over different stressed conditions to monitor the liquidity of an entity these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies with several tests performed daily given the range of potential stresses citi maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for

significant component of citis funding for the citigroup parent company and citis nonbank subsidiaries and is a supplementary source of funding for the bank entities longterm debt is an important funding source due in part to its multiyear contractual maturity structure the weightedaverage maturity of unsecured longterm debt issued by citigroup and its affiliates including citibank with a

citis preferred single point of entry resolution plan strategy only citigroup the parent holding company would enter into bankruptcy while citigroups material legal entities as defined in the public section of its resolution plan which can be found on the federal reserve boards and fdics websites would remain operational outside of any resolution or insolvency proceedings citigroups resolution plan has been designed to minimize the risk of systemic impact to the us and global financial systems while maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of citigroups creditors including its unsecured longterm debt holders in addition in line with the federal reserve boards final total loss absorbing capacity tlac rule citigroup believes it has developed the resolution plan so that citigroups shareholders and unsecured creditors including its unsecured longterm debt holdersbear any losses resulting from citigroups bankruptcy accordingly any value realized by holders of its unsecured longterm debt may not be sufficient to repay the amounts owed to such debt holders in the event of a bankruptcy or other resolution proceeding of citigroup the fdic has also indicated that it was developing a single point of entry strategy to implement the orderly liquidation authority under title ii of the doddfrank act which provides the fdic with the ability to resolve a firm when it is determined that bankruptcy would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the us as previously disclosed in response to feedback received from the federal reserve board and fdic citigroup took the following actions i citicorp llc citicorp an existing wholly owned subsidiary of citigroup was established as an intermediate holding company an ihc for certain of citigroups operating material legal entities secured funding transactions and short term borrowings citi supplements its primary sources of funding with shortterm financings that generally include i secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase ie repos and ii to a lesser extent shortterm borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the fhlb and other market participants secured funding transactions secured funding is primarily accessed through citis brokerdealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both i secured lending activity and ii a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of marketmaking and customer activities citi also executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions through its bank entities which are typically collateralized by government debt securities generally daily changes in the level of citis secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book as described below and securities inventory secured funding of billion as of december decreased from the prioryear period and sequentially excluding the impact of fx translation secured funding decreased from the prioryear period and sequentially driven by normal business activity the average balance for secured funding was approximately billion for the quarter ended december the portion of secured funding in the brokerdealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as matched book activity the majority of this activity is secured by highquality liquid securities such as us treasury securities us agency securities and foreign government debt securities other secured funding is secured by less liquid securities including equity securities corporate bonds and assetbacked securities the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book assets the remainder of the secured funding activity in the brokerdealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions including under periods of stress citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and establishing minimum required funding tenors the weighted average maturity of citis secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater than days as of december citi manages the risks in its secured funding by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity tenor haircut collateral profile and client actions in addition citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress citi generally sources secured funding from more than counterparties shortterm borrowings citis shortterm borrowings of billion as of the fourth

information on citigroups and its affiliates outstanding shortterm borrowings credit ratings citigroups funding and liquidity funding capacity ability to access capital markets and other sources of funds the cost of these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits are partially dependent on its credit ratings the table below shows the ratings for citigroup and citibank as of december

december fitch ratings moodys investors service sp global ratings potential impacts of ratings downgrades ratings downgrades by moodys fitch or sp global ratings could negatively impact citigroups andor citibanks funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity including derivative triggers which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements the following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to citigroup and citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies this analysis is subject to certain estimates estimation methodologies judgments and uncertainties uncertainties include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible counterparties as well as general subjective counterparty behavior for example certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could reevaluate their business relationships with citi and limit transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with citi changes in counterparty behavior could impact citis funding and liquidity as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses the actual impact to citigroup or citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts described below for additional

requirements for which there are no explicit triggers could also be adversely affected in total as of december citi estimates that a onenotch downgrade of citigroup and citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately billion compared to billion as of september see also note to the consolidated financial statements as detailed under highquality liquid assets above citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and nonbank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above in addition a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in citigroups and citibanks contingency funding plans for citigroup these mitigating factors include but are not limited to accessing surplus funding capacity from existing clients tailoring levels of secured lending and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings at certain citibank subsidiaries mitigating actions available to citibank include but are not limited to selling or financing highly liquid government securities tailoring levels of secured lending adjusting the size of select trading assets reducing loan originations and renewals raising additional deposits or borrowing from the fhlb or central banks citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above citibankadditional potential impacts in addition to the above derivative triggers citi believes that a potential downgrade of citibanks senior debtlongterm rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial papershortterm rating of citibank citibank has provided liquidity commitments to consolidated assetbacked commercial paper conduits primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements as of december citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately billion to consolidated assetbacked commercial paper conduits compared to billion as of september for additional information see note to the consolidated financial statements in addition to the abovereferenced liquidity resources of certain citibank entities citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above market risk overview market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in the value of citis assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices and credit spreads as well as their implied volatilities market risk emanates from both citis trading and nontrading portfolios for additional information on market risk and market risk management see risk factors above each business is required to establish with approval from citis market risk management a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of citis overall risk appetite these limits are monitored by the risk organization including various regional legal entity and business risk management committees citis country and business asset liability committees and the citigroup risk management and asset liability committees in all cases the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for remaining within their defined limits market risk of nontrading portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios stems from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on citis net interest income and on citis accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci from its debt securities portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital invested in foreign currencies net interest income at risk net interest income for interest rate exposure purposes is the difference between the yield earned on the nontrading portfolio assets including customer loans and the rate paid on the liabilities including customer deposits or company borrowings net interest income is affected by changes in the level of interest rates as well as the amounts and mix of assets and liabilities and the timing of contractual and assumed repricing of assets and liabilities to reflect market rates citis principal measure of risk to net interest income is interest rate exposure ire ire measures the change in expected net interest income in each currency resulting solely from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates citis estimated ire incorporates various assumptions including prepayment rates on loans customer behavior and the impact of pricing decisions for example in rising interest rate scenarios portions of the deposit portfolio may be assumed to experience rate increases that are less than the change in market interest rates in declining interest rate scenarios it is assumed that mortgage portfolios experience higher prepayment rates citis estimated ire below assumes that its businesses andor citi treasury make no additional changes in balances or positioning in response to the unanticipated rate changes citi is planning to transition the sensitivity analysis for its ire see the current ire sensitivity impacts below employing enhanced methodologies and changes to certain assumptions the changes include among other things assumptions around the projected balance sheet being more static coupled with revisions to the treatment of certain business contributions to ire mainly accrual positions in icgs markets businesses these changes are planned for and will result in a higher impact to citis nii and aoci and a better reflection of the nature of the portfolios in order to manage changes in interest rates effectively citi may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits purchase fixedrate securities issue debt that is either fixed or floating or enter into derivative transactions that have the opposite risk exposures citi regularly assesses the viability of these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and implements such strategies when it believes those actions are prudent citi manages interest rate risk as a consolidated companywide position citis clientfacing businesses create interest ratesensitive positions including loans and deposits as part of their ongoing activities citi treasury aggregates these risk positions and manages them centrally operating within established limits citi treasury makes positioning decisions and uses tools such as citis investment securities portfolio companyissued debt and interest rate derivatives to target the desired risk profile changes in citis interest rate risk position reflect the accumulated changes in all nontrading assets and liabilities with potentially large and offsetting impacts as well as in citi treasurys positioning decisions citigroup employs additional measurements including stress testing the impact of nonlinear interest rate movements on the value of the balance sheet and the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility particularly as they relate to mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities and the potential impact of the change in the spread between different market indices interest rate risk of investment portfoliosimpact on aoci citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its aoci which can in turn impact citis common equity and tangible common equity this will impact citis common equity tier and other regulatory capital ratios citis goal is to benefit from an increase in the market level of interest rates while limiting the impact of changes in aoci on its regulatory capital position aoci at risk is managed as part of the companywide interest rate risk position aoci at risk considers potential changes in aoci and the corresponding impact on the common equity tier capital ratio relative to citis capital generation capacity the following table sets forth the estimated impact to citis net interest income aoci and the common equity tier capital ratio on a fully implemented basis each

are managed economically in combination with marktomarket positions the us dollar interest rate exposure associated with these businesses was million for a bps instantaneous increase in interest rates as of december includes the effect of changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments the yearoveryear increase in the estimated impact to net interest income primarily reflected changes in citis balance sheet composition and citi treasury positioning the yearoveryear changes in the estimated impact to aoci and the common equity tier capital ratio primarily reflected the impact of the composition of citi treasurys investment and derivatives portfolio in the event of a parallel instantaneous bps increase in interest rates citi expects that the negative impact to aoci would be offset in shareholders equity through the expected recovery of the impact on aoci through accretion of citis investment portfolio over a period of time as of december citi expects that the billion negative impact to aoci in such a scenario could potentially be offset over approximately months the following table sets forth the estimated impact to citis net interest income aoci and the common equity tier capital ratio on a fully implemented basis under five different changes in interest rate scenarios for the us dollar and citis other currencies the bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers do not fall below zero ie the flooring assumption the rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products in millions of dollars except as otherwise noted scenario scenario scenario scenario scenario overnight rate change bps 10year rate change bps estimated annualized impact to net interest income us dollar all other currencies total

interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10year rate are interpolated includes the effect of changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments as shown in the table above the magnitude of the impact to citis net interest income and aoci is greater under scenario as compared to scenario this is because the combination of changes to citis investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citis pension liabilities results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediateterm maturities changes in foreign exchange ratesimpacts on aoci and capital as of december citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citis tangible common equity tce by approximately billion or as a result of changes to citis fx translation adjustment in aoci net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso euro singapore dollar and indian rupee this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may take including ongoing management of its fx translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citis net investments in foreign currency denominated capital these movements also change the value of citis risk weighted assets denominated in those currencies this coupled with citis foreign currency hedging strategies such as foreign currency borrowings foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citis common equity tier capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock as described above in addition the effect of citis ongoing management strategies with respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates and the quarterly impact of these changes on citis tce and common equity tier

hedged afs debt securities is included in aoci and not reflected above factor sensitivities factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of a position for a defined change in a market risk factor such as a change in the value of a us treasury bond for a onebasispoint change in interest rates citis global market risk function within the independent risk management organization works to ensure that factor sensitivities are calculated monitored and limited for all material risks taken in the trading portfolios value at risk var var estimates at a confidence level the potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions assuming a one day holding period var statistics which are based on historical data can be materially different across firms due to differences in portfolio composition differences in var methodologies and differences in model parameters as a result citi believes var statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of trends in risktaking within a firm rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risktaking across firms citi uses a single independently approved monte carlo simulation var model see var model review and validation below which has been designed to capture material risk sensitivities such as first and second order sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices of various asset classesrisk types such as interest rate credit spread foreign exchange equity and commodity risks citis var includes positions that are measured at fair value it does not include investment securities classified as afs or htm for information on these securities see note to the consolidated financial statements citi believes its var model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fattail scaling and the greater of shortterm approximately the most recent month and longterm three years market volatility the monte carlo simulation involves approximately market factors making use of approximately time series with sensitivities updated daily volatility parameters updated intramonthly and correlation parameters updated monthly the conservative features of the var calibration contribute an approximate addon to what would be a var estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly normally distributed markets as set forth in the table below citis average

var december average december average covariance adjustment also known as diversification benefit equals the difference between the total var and the sum of the vars tied to each risk type the benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and consequently the total var on a given day will be lower than the sum of the vars relating to each risk type the determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes the total trading

validation generally citis var review and model validation process entails reviewing the model framework major assumptions and implementation of the mathematical algorithm in addition product specific backtesting on portfolios is periodically completed as part of the ongoing model performance monitoring process and reviewed with citis us banking regulators furthermore regulatory var backtesting as described below is performed against buyandhold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple subportfolios across the organization trading desk level icg business segment and citigroup and the results are shared with us banking regulators material var model and assumption changes must be independently validated within citis independent risk management organization all model changes including those for the var model are validated by the model validation group within citis model risk management in the event of significant model changes parallel model runs are undertaken prior to implementation in addition significant model and assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by citis us banking regulators citi uses the same independently validated var model for both regulatory var and risk management var ie total trading and total trading and credit portfolios vars and as such the model review and validation process for both purposes is as described above regulatory var which is calculated in accordance with basel iii differs from risk management var due to the fact that certain positions included in risk management var are not eligible for market risk treatment in regulatory var the composition of risk management var is discussed under value at risk above the applicability of the var model for positions eligible for market risk treatment under us regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved by citis us banking regulators in accordance with basel iii regulatory var includes all trading bookcovered positions and all foreign exchange and commodity exposures pursuant to basel iii regulatory var excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified as nontrading book and categories of exposures that are specifically excluded as covered positions regulatory var excludes cva on derivative instruments and dva on citis own fair value option liabilities cva hedges are excluded from regulatory var and included in credit riskweighted assets as computed under the advanced approaches for determining riskweighted assets regulatory var backtesting in accordance with basel iii citi is required to perform backtesting to evaluate the effectiveness of its regulatory var model regulatory var backtesting is the process in which the daily oneday var at a confidence interval is compared to the buyandhold profit and loss ie the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and repriced the following day buyandhold profit and loss represents the daily marktomarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue net interest fees and commissions intraday trading profit and loss and changes in reserves based on a confidence level citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buyandhold losses exceed the regulatory var given the conservative calibration of citis var model as a result of taking the greater of short and longterm volatilities and fattail scaling of volatilities citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of backtesting exceptions the following graph shows the daily buyandhold profit and loss associated with citis covered positions compared to citis oneday regulatory var during as of december one backtesting exception was observed at the citigroup level the difference between the of days with buyandhold gains for regulatory var backtesting and the of days with trading net interest and other revenue associated with citis trading businesses shown in the histogram of daily tradingrelated revenue below reflects among other things that a significant portion of citis tradingrelated revenue is not generated from daily price movements on these positions and exposures as well as differences in the portfolio composition of regulatory var and risk management var regulatory trading var and associated buyandhold proﬁt and loss112 months ended december in millions of dollars total regulatory var buy and hold pl mm regulatory var t1 mm oneday regulatory var and associated buyandhold profit and loss mm jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec buyandhold profit and loss as defined by the banking regulators under basel iii represents the daily marktomarket revenue movement attributable to the trading position from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intraday trading profit and loss on new and terminated trades as well as changes in reserves therefore it is not comparable to the tradingrelated revenue presented in the chart of daily tradingrelated revenue above stress testing citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market movements it is performed on individual positions and trading portfolios as well as in aggregate inclusive of multiple trading portfolios citis market risk management after consultations with the businesses develops both systemic and specific stress scenarios reviews the output of periodic stress testing exercises and uses the information to assess the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits citi uses two complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across all major risk factors ie equity foreign exchange commodity interest rate and credit spreads topdown systemic stresses and bottomup businessspecific stresses systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact of extreme market movements on an institutionwide basis and are constructed using both historical periods of market stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios businessspecific stresses are designed to probe the risks of particular portfolios and market segments especially those risks that are not fully captured in var and systemic stresses the systemic stress scenarios and businessspecific stress scenarios at citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior management and also to calculate internal risk capital for trading market risk in general changes in market values are defined over a oneyear horizon for the most liquid positions and market factors changes in market values are defined over a shorter twomonth horizon the limited set of positions and market factors whose market value changes are defined over a twomonth horizon are those that in managements judgment have historically remained very liquid during financial crises even as the trading liquidity of most other positions and market factors materially declined operational risk overview operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events this includes legal risk which is the risk of loss including litigation costs settlements and regulatory fines resulting from the failure of citi to comply with laws regulations prudent ethical standards and contractual obligations in any aspect of its businesses but excludes strategic and reputation risks citi also recognizes the impact of operational risk on the reputation risk associated with citis business activities citi has a governance structure for the oversight of operational risk exposures through business risk and controls committees brccs which include a citigroup brcc as well as business functions regional and country brccs brccs are chaired by the individuals in the first line of defense and provide escalation channels for senior management to review operational risk exposures including breaches of operational risk appetite key indicators operational risk events and control issues membership includes senior business and functions leadership as well as members of the second line of defense operational risk is inherent in citis global business activities as well in addition independent risk management including the operational risk management group works proactively with citis businesses and functions to drive a strong and embedded operational risk management culture and framework across citi the operational risk management group actively challenges business and functions implementation of the operational risk management framework requirements and the quality of operational risk management practices and outcomes information about businesses key operational risks historical operational risk losses and the control environment is reported by each major business segment and functional area citis operational risk profile and related information is summarized and reported to senior management as well as to the audit and risk committees of citis board of directors by the head of operational risk management operational risk is measured through operational

information security incidents citi recognizes the significance of these risks and therefore leverages an intelligenceled strategy to protect against detect and respond to and recover from cyber attacks further citi actively participates in financial industry government and crosssector knowledgesharing groups to enhance individual and collective cybersecurity preparedness and resilience as related support functions and can result in losses citi maintains a comprehensive citiwide risk taxonomy to classify operational risks that it faces using standardized definitions across citis

in managing global riskoverview above citis goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of its businesses the markets in which it operates its capital and liquidity and the competitive economic and regulatory environment this includes effectively managing operational risk and maintaining or reducing operational risk exposures within citis operational risk appetite citis independent operational risk management group has established a globaloperational risk management framework with policies and practices for identification measurement monitoring managing and reporting operational risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the internal control environment as part of this framework citi has defined its operational risk appetite and established a managers control assessment mca process for selfidentification of significant operational risks assessment of the performance of key controls and mitigation of residual risk above acceptable levels each major business segment must implement operational risk processes consistent with the requirements of this framework this includes understanding the operational risks they are exposed to designing controls to mitigate identified risks establishing key indicators monitoring and reporting whether the operational risk exposures are in or out of their operational risk appetite having processes in place to bring operational risk exposures within acceptable levels periodically estimate and aggregate the operational risks they are exposed to and ensuring that sufficient resources are available to actively improve the operational risk environment and mitigate emerging risks citi considers operational risks that result from the introduction of new or changes to existing products or result from significant changes in its organizational structures systems processes and personnel risk management citis technology and cybersecurity risk management program is built on three lines of defense citis first line of defense under the office of the chief information security officer provides frontline business operational and technical controls and capabilities to protect against cybersecurity risks and to respond to cyber incidents and data breaches citi manages these threats through stateoftheart fusion centers which serve as central commands for monitoring and coordinating responses to cyber threats the enterprise information security team is responsible for infrastructure defense and security controls performing vulnerability assessments and thirdparty information security assessments employee awareness and training programs and security incident management in each case the team works in coordination with a network of information security officers who are embedded within the businesses and functions globally citis operational risk managementtechnology and cyber ormtc and independent compliance risk managementtechnology and information security icrmt groups serve as the second line of defense and actively evaluate anticipate and challenge citis risk mitigation practices and capabilities citi seeks to proactively identify and remediate technology and cybersecurity risks before they materialize as incidents that negatively affect business operations accordingly the ormtc team independently challenges and monitors capabilities in accordance with citis defined technology and cyber risk appetite statements to address evolving cybersecurity risks and corresponding regulations ormtc and icrmt teams collectively also monitor cyber legal and regulatory requirements identify and define emerging risks execute strategic cyber threat assessments perform new products and initiative reviews perform data management risk oversight and conduct cyber risk assurance reviews inclusive of thirdparty assessments in addition ormtc employs tools and oversees and challenges metrics that are both tailored to cybersecurity and technology and aligned with citis overall operational risk management framework to effectively track identify and manage risk internal audit serves as the third line of defense and independently provides assurance on how effectively the organization as a whole manages cybersecurity risk citi also has multiple senior committees such as the information security risk committee isrc which governs enterpriselevel risk tolerance inclusive of cybersecurity risk board oversight citis board of directors provides oversight of managements efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risk and respond to cyber incidents the board receives regular reports on cybersecurity and engages in discussions throughout the year with management and subjectmatter experts on the effectiveness of citis overall cybersecurity program the board also obtains updates on citis inherent cybersecurity risks and citis road map and progress for addressing these risks moreover citis board and its committee members receive contemporaneous reporting on significant cyber events including response legal obligations and outreach and notification to regulators and customers when needed as well as guidance to management as appropriate in the board of directors underwent a cyber incident tabletop exercise also in the boards risk management committee approved a standalone cybersecurity risk appetite statement against which citis performance is measured quarterly for additional information on the boards oversight of cybersecurity risk management see citis proxy statement to be filed with the sec in march compliance risk compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from violations of laws rules or regulations or from nonconformance with prescribed practices internal policies and procedures or ethical standards compliance risk exposes citi to fines civil money penalties payment of damages and the voiding of contracts compliance risk can result in diminished reputation harm to citis customers limited business opportunities and lessened expansion potential it encompasses the risk of noncompliance with all laws and regulations as well as prudent ethical standards and some contractual obligations it could also include exposure to litigation known as legal risk from all aspects of traditional and nontraditional banking citi seeks to operate with integrity maintain strong ethical standards and adhere to applicable policies and regulatory and legal requirements citi must maintain and execute a proactive compliance risk management crm policy that is designed to manage compliance risk effectively across citi with a view to fundamentally strengthen the compliance risk management culture across the lines of defense taking into account citis risk governance framework and regulatory requirements independent compliance risk managements icrm primary objectives are to drive and embed a culture of compliance and control throughout citi maintain and oversee an integrated crm policy and compliance risk framework that facilitates enterprisewide compliance with local national or crossborder laws rules or regulations citis internal policies standards and procedures and relevant standards of conduct assess compliance risks and issues across product lines functions and geographies supported by globally consistent systems and compliance risk management processes and provide compliance risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities to anticipate control and mitigate compliance risk citi has established the crm policy to achieve standardization and centralization of methodologies and processes and to enable more consistent and comprehensive execution of compliance risk management citi has a commitment as well as an obligation to identify assess and mitigate compliance risks associated with its businesses and functions icrm is responsible for oversight of citis crm policy while all businesses and global control functions are responsible for managing their compliance risks and operating within the compliance risk appetite the responsibility for enhancing and protecting citis reputation is shared by all colleagues who are guided by citis code of conduct colleagues are expected to exercise sound judgment and common sense in decisions and actions they are also expected to promptly escalate all issues that present potential reputation risk in line with policy strategic risk as discussed above strategic risk is the risk of a sustained impact not episodic impact to citis core strategic objectives as measured by impacts on anticipated earnings market capitalization or capital arising from the external factors affecting the companys operating environment as well as the risks associated with defining the strategy and executing the strategy which are identified measured and managed as part of the strategic risk framework at the enterprise level in this context external factors affecting citis operating environment are the economic environment geopoliticalpolitical landscape industry competitive landscape societal trends customerclient behavior regulatory legislative environment and trends related to investorsshareholders citis executive management team is responsible for the development and execution of citis strategy this strategy is translated into forwardlooking plans collectively citis strategic plan that are then cascaded across the organization citis strategic plan is presented to the board on an annual basis and is aligned with risk appetite thresholds and includes top risk identification as required by internal frameworks it is also aligned with limit requirements for capital allocation governance and oversight of strategic risk is facilitated by internal committees on a groupwide basis as well as strategic committees at the icg gcb and regional levels citi works to ensure that strategic risks are adequately considered and addressed across its various risk management activities and that strategic risks are assessed in the context of citis risk appetite citi conducts a topdown bottomup risk identification process to identify risks including strategic risks business segments undertake a quarterly risk identification process to systematically identify and document all material risks faced by citi independent risk management oversees the risk identification process through regular reviews and coordinates identification and monitoring of top risks independent risk management also manages strategic risk by monitoring risk appetite thresholds in conjunction with various strategic risk committees which are part of the governance structure that citi has in place to manage its strategic risks for additional information on citis strategic risks see risk factors strategic risks above citi carries out its objectives and fulfills its responsibilities through the compliance risk framework which is composed of the following integrated key activities to holistically manage compliance risk management of citis compliance with laws rules and regulations by identifying and analyzing changes assessing the impact and implementing appropriate policies processes and controls developing and providing compliance training to ensure colleagues are aware of and understand the key laws rules and regulations monitoring the compliance risk appetite which is articulated through qualitative compliance risk statements describing citis appetite for certain types of risk and quantitative measures to monitor the companys compliance risk exposure monitoring and testing of compliance risks and controls in assessing conformance with laws rules regulations and internal policies and issue identification escalation and remediation to drive accountability including measurement and reporting of compliance risk metrics against established thresholds in support of the crm policy and compliance risk appetite as discussed above citi is working to address the frb and occ consent orders which include improvements to citis compliance risk framework and its enterprisewide application for additional information regarding the consent orders see citis consent order compliance above reputation risk citis reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its stakeholders and citi is diligent in enhancing and protecting its reputation with its colleagues customers investors and regulators to support this citi has developed a reputation risk framework under this framework citigroup and citibank have implemented a risk appetite statement and related key indicators to monitor corporate activities and operations relative to our risk appetite the framework also requires that business segments and regions escalate significant reputation risks that require review or mitigation through a reputation risk committee or equivalent the reputation risk committees which are composed of citis most senior executives govern the process by which material reputation risks are identified monitored reported managed and escalated the reputation risk committees determine the appropriate actions to be taken in line with risk appetite and regulatory expectations while promoting a culture of risk awareness and high standards of integrity and ethical behavior across the company consistent with citis mission and value proposition the reputation risk committees in the business segments and regions are part of the governance infrastructure that citi has in place to review the reputation risk posed by business activities sales practices product design or perceived conflicts of interest these committees may also raise potential reputation risks for due consideration by the reputation risk committee at the corporate level the citigroup reputation risk committee may escalate reputation risks to the nomination governance and public affairs committee or other appropriate committee of the citigroup board of directors other risks libor transition risk the libor administrator ceased publication of nonusd libor and one week and twomonth usd libor on a representative basis on december with plans to cease publication of all other usd libor tenors on june regulators expect banks including citi to have ceased entering into new contracts that reference usd libor as a benchmark by december except for limited circumstances as set out in regulatory guidance citi recognizes that a transition away from and discontinuance of libor presents various risks and challenges that could significantly impact financial markets and market participants including citi for information about citis risks from a transition away from and discontinuation of libor or any other benchmark rates see risk factorsother risks above accordingly citi has continued its efforts to identify and manage its libor transition risks for example citi continues to closely monitor legislative regulatory and other developments related to libor transition matters and legislative relief the international swaps and derivatives association isda published the interbank offered rate ibor fallbacks protocol for existing ibor derivatives transactions which became effective in january the ibor fallbacks protocol provides derivatives market participants with new fallbacks for legacy and new derivatives contracts if both counterparties adhere to the protocol or engage in bilateral amendments see discussion below regarding citis adherence to the protocol in april legislation was adopted in new york state that provides for the use of a statutory replacement for usd libor in certain new york law legacy contracts similar federal legislation was passed in the house of representatives in december and is pending passage by the senate although there is no guarantee that the federal legislative proposal will become law in addition citi has established a libor governance and implementation program focused on identifying and addressing the impact of libor transition on citis clients operational capabilities and financial contracts the program operates globally across citis businesses and functions and includes active involvement of senior management oversight by citis asset and liability committee and reporting to the risk management committee of citigroups board of directors as part of the program citi has continued to implement its libor transition action plans and associated roadmaps under the following key workstreams program management transition strategy and risk management customer management including internal communications and training legalcontract management and product management financial exposures and risk management regulatory and industry engagement operations and technology and finance risk tax and treasury during citi continued to participate in a number of working groups formed by global regulators including the alternative reference rates committee arrc convened by the frb these working groups promote and advance development of alternative reference rates and seek to identify and address potential challenges from any transition to such rates citis libor transition action plans and associated roadmaps are intended to be consistent with the timelines recommended by these working groups this includes the commodity futures trading commissions sofr first initiative which is designed to promote derivatives trading in sofr citi also continued to engage with regulators financial accounting bodies and others on libor transition matters citis libor transition efforts include among other things reducing its overall exposure to libor increasing citis virtual client communication efforts and client transition facilitation including outreach regarding new industryled protocols and solutions and using alternative reference rates in certain newly issued financial instruments and products in the past several years citi has issued preferred stock and benchmark debt referencing the secured overnight financing rate sofr and issued customerrelated debt referencing sofr and the sterling overnight interbank average rate sonia the recommended replacement rate for sterling libor citi has also originated and arranged loans referencing sofr and sonia and executed sofr and soniabased derivatives contracts further citi has also been investing in its systems and infrastructure as client activity moves away from libor to alternative reference rates since the arrcs recommendation of cme groups term sofr in july citi has focused on systems readiness to provide term sofr loan and derivatives to clients where permitted in citi also focused on remediating existing libor contracts for which publication ceased on a representative basis on december substantially all of these contracts were remediated by december and citi continues to actively engage in and track the remediation of any remaining contracts after december as of december citis overall usd libor gross notional exposure for contracts maturing after the libor cessation date of june was approximately trillion which includes approximately trillion of cleared derivatives that are covered by planned central counterparty clearing house ccp conversions and approximately trillion of bilateral derivatives that are covered by robust contract fallback language the remaining exposure of approximately trillion includes bilateral derivatives and cash products that will be addressed by contract remediation plans in addition for libor contracts that have not yet been remediated citi continues to review the effect of relevant legislative solutions which are expected to facilitate the transition to replacement rates climate risk climate change presents immediate and longterm risks to citi and its clients and customers with the risks expected to increase over time climate risk refers to the risk of loss arising from climate change and is comprised of both physical risk and transition risk physical risk considers how chronic and acute climate change eg increased storms drought fires floods can directly damage physical assets eg real estate crops or otherwise impact their value or productivity transition risk considers how changes in policy technology business practices and market preferences to address climate change eg carbon pricing policies power generation shifts from fossil fuels to renewable energy can lead to changes in the value of assets commodities and companies climate risk is an overarching risk that can act as a driver of other categories of risk such as credit risk from obligors exposed to high climate risk reputational risk from increased stakeholder concerns about financing highcarbon industries and operational risk from physical risks to citis facilities and personnel citi currently identifies climate risk as an emerging risk within its enterprise risk management framework emerging risks are risks or thematic issues that are either new to the landscape or in the case of climate risk existing risks that are rapidly changing or evolving in an escalating fashion which are difficult to assess due to limited data or other uncertainties for additional information on climate risk see risk factorsother risks above citi reviews factors related to climate risk under its longstanding environmental and social risk management esrm policy which includes a focus on climate risk related to financed projects and clients in highcarbon sectors cautious of the credit risk of stranded assets as well as the reputational risks associated with the coal sector due to its high carbon emissions citi began a phasedown of its financing of thermal coal mining companies in and of new coalfired power plants in as citis phasedown has continued citis esrm policy was updated to include a prohibition on all projectrelated financing of new coalfired power plants and new or expanding thermal coal mines as well as clear timetables to reduce financing of companies with high exposure to coal fired power and coal mining who do not pursue lowcarbon transition in the coming years these sector approaches allow citi to set a comprehensive and industrywide approach to clarify its positions set clear expectations for its clients and help address certain climate risk driven credit risk concerns while reducing reputation risk citi continues to explore and test methodologies for quantifying how climate risks could impact the individual credit profiles of its clients across various sectors to assist in embedding climate risk assessments in its credit assessment process citi is developing sectorspecific climate risk assessments such climate risk assessments are designed to supplement publicly available client disclosures and data provided from thirdparty vendors and facilitate conversations with clients on their most material climate risks and management plans for adaptation and mitigation in the near term citis assessments will consider sectors that have been identified as higher climate risk by citis risk identification process this will not only help citi better understand its clients businesses and climaterelated risks but will also provide a source of climate data citis net zero plan is leading to the further integration of climate risk discussions into client engagement and client selection furthermore citi is developing globally consistent principles and approaches for managing climate risk across citi climate risk will be embedded into relevant policies and processes over time in addition citi continues to participate in financial industry collaborations to develop and pilot new methodologies and approaches for measuring and assessing the potential financial risks of climate change citi is also closely monitoring regulatory developments on climate risk and sustainable finance and actively engaging with regulators on these topics for additional information about sustainability and other esg matters at citi see sustainability and other esg matters above country risk top country exposures the following table presents citis top exposures by country excluding the us as of december

citi uses argentinas official market exchange rate to remeasure its net argentine pesodenominated assets into the us dollar as of december the official argentine peso exchange rate against the us dollar was the central bank of argentina maintains certain capital and currency controls that generally restrict citis ability to access us dollars in argentina and remit substantially all of its earnings from its argentine operations citis net investment in its argentine operations is likely to increase as citi continues to generate net income from its argentine franchise and the majority of its earnings cannot be remitted due to the currency controls implemented by the central bank of argentina certain indirect foreign exchange mechanisms have developed that some argentine entities may use to obtain us dollars generally at rates that are significantly higher than argentinas official exchange rate citibank argentina is precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms and these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to remeasure citis net monetary assets into the us dollar under us gaap citi cannot predict future fluctuations in argentinas official market exchange rate or to what extent citi may be able to access us dollars at the official exchange rate in the future citi economically hedges the foreign currency risk in its net argentine pesodenominated assets to the extent possible and prudent using non deliverable forward ndf derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of argentina as of december the international ndf market had very limited liquidity resulting in citi being unable to economically hedge nearly all of its argentine peso exposure as a result and to the extent that citi does not execute ndf contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future citi would record devaluations on its net argentine pesodenominated assets in earnings without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and sovereign risk associated with its argentine assets citi believes it has established appropriate allowances for credit losses on its argentine loans and appropriate fair value adjustments on argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value for such risks under us gaap as of december however us regulatory agencies may require citi to record additional reserves in the future increasing icgs cost of credit based on the perceived country risk associated with its argentine exposures for additional information on citis emerging markets risks including those related to its argentine exposures see risk factors above ffieccrossborder claims on third parties and local country assets citis crossborder disclosures are set forth below based on the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec the following summarizes some of the ffiec key reporting guidelines amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate obligor counterparty collateral only including qualifying liquid collateral issuer or guarantor as applicable eg a security recorded by a citi us entity but issued by the uk government is considered uk exposure a loan recorded by a citi mexico entity to a customer domiciled in mexico where the underlying collateral is held in germany is considered german exposure amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received for secured financing transactions ie repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and securities loaned and borrowed and are reported based on notional amounts netting of derivative receivables and payables reported at fair value is permitted but only under a legally binding netting agreement with the same specific counterparty and does not include the benefit of margin received or hedges credit default swaps cds are included based on the gross notional amount sold and purchased and do not include any offsetting cds on the same underlying entity loans are reported without the benefit of hedges given the requirements noted above citis ffiec crossborder exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate in some cases significantly from period to period as an example because total outstandings under ffiec guidelines do not include the benefit of margin or hedges market volatility in interest rates foreign exchange rates and credit spreads may cause significant fluctuations in the level of total outstandings all else being equal the tables below show each country whose total outstandings exceeded of total citigroup assets in billions of dollars united kingdom cayman islands
