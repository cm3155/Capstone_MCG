management discussion section operator hello and welcome to citis second quarter earnings review with chief executive officer jane fraser and chief financial officer mark mason todays call will be hosted by jen landis head of citi investor relations we ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the questionandanswer session also as a reminder this conference is being recorded today if you have any objections please disconnect at this time ms landis you may begin jennifer landis headinvestor relations citigroup inc thank you operator good morning and thank you all for joining us id like to remind you that todays presentation which is available for download on our website citigroupcom may contain forwardlooking statements which are based on managements current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our sec filings with that ill turn it over to jane jane nind fraser chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you jen and thank you everyone for joining us today when we last spoke we said the macro and geopolitical outlook was complex and uncertain so in one sense little has changed however the headwinds have certainly crystallized and its against that backdrop that im proud of the results our team delivered this quarter as we execute on our strategy and transformation there are mounting costs to the series of supply shocks weve experienced and now we need to pay attention to an additional s in esg and that is security in addition to energy and cybersecurity food security has also come into sharper focus threatening to spread the humanitarian cost of the war well beyond europe resiliency is the new priority for governments and corporates alike and all of this is adding to inflationary pressures which are in turn being met with a more hawkish response from the fed and other central banks all contributing to sharply lower us consumer confidence higher rates and qt will keep volatility high that said while sentiment has shifted little of the data i see tells me the us is on the cusp of a recession consumer spending remains well above precovid levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress and as any employer will tell you the job market remains very tight similarly our corporate clients see robust demand and healthy balance sheets with revenue softness attributed to supply chain constraints so far so while a recession could indeed take place over the next two years in the us its highly unlikely to be a sharper downturn as others in recent memory im just back from europe where its a different story we expect a very difficult winter is coming and thats due to disruptions in the energy supply there is also increasing concern about the secondorder effects on industrial production and how that will affect economic activity across the continent and the mood is of course further darkened by the belief that the war in ukraine will not end anytime soon in asia a rebound in china also faces citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 some constraints given the potential for future lockdowns the amount of leverage in the chinese economy and stress in their property sector given this uncertain environment im quite pleased with our overall performance we reported net income of billion an eps of and an rotce of we grew revenues at yearoveryear whilst remaining on track to meet our expense guidance for the year services continued to show excellent momentum with revenues up yearoveryear while some of that growth is a result of the rate environment we had doubledigit fee growth consistent with the strategy we presented to you in march tts in particular fired on all cylinders as clients took advantage of our global network leading to the best quarter this business has had in a decade the market volatility that we saw in the first quarter continued into the second driving corporate clients in particular to be more active in risk management contributing to revenue growth of in markets the volatility we saw in foreign exchange rates commodities and equity derivatives favored our mix and we were more efficient in our capital usage now while this level of activity is related to where we are in the current cycle rather than a new baseline end market i believe we are helping our clients navigate this environment quite well and it shows how our emphasis on our corporate clients globally given their consistent trading needs is a differentiating one for us in markets on the flip side that same environment continues to put a great deal of pressure on the investment banking wallet with our revenues down however we are seeing an increase of lending as our clients are being less inclined to obtain financing through the debt markets given the recent swings in us personal banking the positive drivers we saw in our two credit card businesses over the last few quarters converted into solid revenue growth this quarter most notably growth in branded cards and you can see how resilient the consumer is in us through the elevated payment rates and the low level of credit losses they have however shifted their spend far more to travel and entertainment which are now outpacing levels while volatility can be an opportunity for our trading desks lower asset prices are a headwind for wealth management asia again was hit harder than other regions leading to flat yearoveryear wealth management revenues overall that said we continue to execute our wealth strategy across a number of fronts including building our base of client advisors expanding our private banks physical footprint to reach countries with the additions of germany and france and increasing referrals from our branch network in the us so the underlying strategic drivers for the longterm growth of this business continue to advance overall while we did have a slight build in reserves given the increasing possibility of a recession we are operating from a position of strength our capital liquidity credit quality and reserve levels are strong and our diversified business mix also positions us well for the choppy waters on the horizon well while the world has changed since we presented our investor day to you in march our strategy has not we have continued to execute it with discipline and with urgency the quarterly report card on slide should help you hold us accountable for our progress we are laserfocused on the longterm goals we set out in march and i see this quarters performance as validating that we are indeed on the right path simplifying the firm is a high priority and we made good progress executing on our divestitures such as closing the sale of australia during the quarter we are well into the sales process in mexico working through the citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 regulatory and legal dynamics that can be expected in a transaction of this nature in terms of russia we continue to shrink the size of our business and take steps to reduce our financial exposure given the complex environment we are considering the full range of possibilities to exit our consumer and commercial banking businesses including portfolio sales as divestitures such as australia progress we are beginning to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our model and this discipline is critical to ensuring we have the resources to invest in the businesses where we want to gain or maintain a competitive advantage and to ensure the success of our transformation to that point we were particularly pleased that our aml consent order was lifted by the occ in april we are committed to ensuring our technology controls and processes are up to the standards our regulators expect of us and we expect of ourselves let me end on capital we increased our cet1 ratio to this quarter whilst returning billion in capital including a rather modest level of buybacks our tangible book value per share now exceeds despite the strength of our balance sheet and reserves our stress capital buffer is set to increase to in the fourth quarter as a result of this years stress test scenario so over the nearterm we plan to build to a cet1 ratio of approximately including a basis point management buffer over the mediumterm our cet1 target remains at to we are prioritizing our dividend and are pausing our share repurchases as we build capital we have a management buffer which we can use to help ensure a smooth path to our required levels and mark will walk you through our approach in a few minutes we will generate significant capital given our earnings power and the completion of pending divestitures we know how important buybacks are to shareholder value creation in particular when we are trading at these levels and are committed to restarting them as soon as it is prudent to do so we will make every effort to optimize our capital especially in businesses such as markets so we balance the needs of our clients our investors and our regulators overall in a challenging macro and geopolitical environment our team delivered solid results and the bank is in a very strong position to weather uncertain times whilst playing to our strengths im confident about the path ahead and im pleased with our early progress now id like to turn it over to mark and then wed be delighted as always to take your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you jane and good morning everyone im going to start with the firmwide financial results focusing on yearoveryear comparisons for the second quarter unless i indicate otherwise then spend a little more time on expenses capital and russia and then turn to the results of each segment and end with guidance on slide we show financial results for the full firm as jane mentioned earlier in the second quarter we reported net income of billion an eps of with an rotce of on billion of revenues in the quarter total revenues increased with growth in both net interest income as well as noninterest revenues net interest income grew driven by higher rates as well as strong volumes across icg and pbwm non interest revenue grew driven by fixed income and services which more than offset lower noninterest revenue in investment banking and pbwm citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 total expenses of billion increased largely driven by transformation businessled investments and volumerelated expenses on a yeartodate basis expenses were up but excluding divestiturerelated impacts were up also driven by the factors i just mentioned cost of credit was billion driven by net credit losses of million and an acl build of approximately million at the end of the quarter we had approximately billion in total reserves with a reservetofunded loan ratio of and are well capitalized with a cet1 ratio of on slide we show an expense walk for the second quarter with the key underlying drivers as i mentioned earlier expenses increased by of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about two thirds related to risks controls data and the finance programs and approximately of the investments in those programs are related to technology and as of today we have over people dedicated to the transformation about of the expense increase was driven by businessled investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisors in wealth and we continue to invest in the client experience as well as front office onboarding and platforms was due to higher revenue and volumerelated expenses largely in markets and cards and approximately was driven by compensation as well as other risk and control investments partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation across all these buckets we continue to invest in technology which is up for the quarter before we move on from expenses we wanted to provide some tangible examples of what we are working on regarding our transformation and some of the benefits we expect to see over time the transformation is designed to improve our governance and processes enhance our policies and leverage technology to strengthen our controls weve been actively investing in technology to improve automation and hiring people to stand up these efforts to this end we are enhancing our risk management processes and capabilities across a number of areas for example in banking weve gone live with a new platform and now begun to consolidate our loan processing systems to one loan servicing platform and we have continued to build out our infrastructure to enhance our stress testing capabilities across the firm particularly useful in this market given the power and importance of data we are redesigning our data governance and data organization which will help us improve the timeliness and quality of our data these foundational datarelated changes will allow us to simplify and improve client onboarding and deepening product development as well as enhance our data analytics for every function and we are streamlining our financial planning process to allow for multiple scenarios with greater frequency including more agile capital planning and we signed with a major software provider to begin a multiyear process of modernizing and moving our ledger platforms deployed across instances to one cloudbased ledger and while we are in the early stages of these initiatives we expect the efficiencies from these investments to be key in helping us meet our investor day commitments on slide we show net interest income loans and deposits in the second quarter net interest income increased by approximately billion on a sequential basis driven by higher rates day count growth in loans as well as the impact of the european dividend season on our markets business on a yearoveryear basis net interest income increased by approximately billion driven by higher interest rates as well as volumes across businesses and we grew average loans by approximately in icg mainly in trade finance and in pbwm legacy franchises loans declined largely driven by the reclassification of loans to heldforsale and sequentially the gross yield on our loans increased by basis points and the cost of our interestbearing deposits increased by basis points citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 on slide we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics we maintained a very strong balance sheet of our trillion of assets about or billion are highquality liquid assets or hqlas and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately billion our endofperiod deposits increased by largely driven by tts and wealth on a sequential basis deposits decreased by including the impact of seasonality in wealth from an rwa perspective we saw both advanced and standardized rwa come down both yearoveryear and sequentially as we continued to optimize rwa we ended the quarter with a standardized cet1 ratio of approximately and standardized remains the binding requirement and our tangible book value per share was up on slide we show a sequential cet1 ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our goals over the next few quarters first we generated billion of net income to common which added basis points second we returned billion in the form of dividends and buybacks which drove a reduction of about basis points third the interest rate impact on aoci through our investment portfolio drove a basis point reduction fourth the decrease in disallowed dta drove a five basis point increase and finally the remainder was driven by a combination of our net rwa optimization efforts as well as a basis point benefit from the closing of the australia sale we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of basis points higher than the first quarter and well above the regulatory requirement of we expect our regulatory requirement to increase to in october of to account for the increase in our stress capital buffer from to in january our regulatory requirement will increase to as a result of an increase in our gsib surcharge the combination of our earnings generation closing of divestitures and continued rwa optimization efforts will be important tools as we manage towards our cet1 requirements and our management buffer which was designed to temporarily address volatility will allow us to build gradually while continuing to support our clients given all that we do expect to build to a cet1 target of approximately by midyear which accounts for the increased regulatory requirement and assumes a basis point management buffer however consistent with what we said at investor day our mediumterm target remains at to and while we are pausing buybacks for now as ive said before we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time on slide we provide an update on our exposure to russia in we reduced our exposure by billion in local currency terms which was more than offset by the ruble appreciation as of today the mix of our exposure has changed and is now reflecting a higher proportion of stronger credit names additionally our net investment in our russian entity is now approximately billion up from about million due to the ruble appreciation as a result of the actions that weve taken to reduce our risks we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios our potential capital impact is estimated to be approximately billion down from the billion to billion last quarter on slide we show the results for our institutional clients group revenues increased by largely driven by tts markets security services as well as a gain on loan hedges partially offset by a decrease in investment banking revenues expenses increased driven by transformation businessled investments and volume related expenses partially offset by productivity savings cost of credit was a benefit of million with a net acl release of million and net credit losses of only million the release was largely driven by a reduction in russiarelated risks partially offset by a build due to increased global macro uncertainty this resulted in net income of approximately billion up citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 we grew average loans by largely driven by tts loans which were up average deposits grew driven by the deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions and icg delivered an rotce of on slide we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at investor day which we will show you each quarter in services we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue in treasury and trade solutions revenues were up driven by growth in net interest income as well as growth in nir as we saw strong growth with both mid and large corporate clients and we continue to see healthy underlying drivers in tts that indicate continued strong client activity with us dollar clearing volumes up crossborder flows up and commercial card volumes up again these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and on a combined basis drive approximately of total tts fee revenue security services revenues grew as net interest income grew driven by higher interest rates across currencies and nir grew largely reflecting elevated activity levels in issuer services overall markets revenues were up the macroenvironment played to our strengths with the volatility leading to elevated corporate client activity fixed income markets revenues were up driven by fx rates and commodities due to active engagement with our corporate clients as we helped them manage risk associated with volatile markets equity markets revenues were up driven by strong equity derivative performance partially offset by less client activity in cash and a net decrease in prime balances as lower asset valuations more than offset new client balances banking revenues excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were down driven by investment banking as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted client activity partially offset by higher revenue in corporate lending so we feel very good about the progress we are making here as we continue to deepen existing client relationships as well as acquire new clients now turning to slide we show the results for our personal banking and wealth management businesses revenues were up as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue largely driven by partner payments in retail services expenses were up driven by transformation businessled investments and higher volumedriven expenses partially offset by productivity savings cost of credit of billion was up as we added reserves given the increase in overall uncertainty in the macro environment compared to a net acl release last year and ncls were down as we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios average loans grew driven by strong growth in branded cards as well as growth across retail services and wealth average deposits grew driven by growth across retail and wealth we continue to maintain a strong reservetoloan ratio of in our us cards businesses and pbwm delivered an rotce of while a low return this was driven by the acl build and an increase in expenses in the quarter on slide we show pbwm revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics branded cards revenues were up driven by higher interest on higher loan balances we are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts and card spend volumes both up and average loans up retail services revenues were up also driven by higher interest on higher loan balances partially offset by higher partner payments so despite payment rates remaining elevated the investments we have been making have driven growth in interestearning balances of in branded cards and in retail services and we believe we will continue to grow these balances in the second half of the year citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 retail banking revenues were up primarily driven by deposit spreads and volumes wealth revenues were flat as investment fee headwinds offset nii growth driven by deposits and loan volumes excluding asia revenues were up were starting to see the leading indicators pick up with average deposits up and client advisors up and we are seeing strong new client acquisitions having added private bank clients and over citigold clients since last year on slide we show results for legacy franchises revenues declined largely driven by the closing of the australia consumer sale the korea winddown and muted investment activity in asia and as we mentioned this quarter we closed the sale of the australia consumer business which was a benefit of up to billion of capital on slide we show results for corporateother revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio and expenses were down on slide we briefly touch on the full year outlook at this point we continue to expect fullyear revenues to be up in the lowsingle digit range relative to investor day the rate curve is certainly giving us a tailwind from an nii perspective and markets revenues are up for the first half of the year however as we mentioned earlier we are seeing much lower levels of investment banking activity and this will likely continue for the remainder of the year in terms of expenses we still expect to grow expenses by to excluding the impact of divestitures while we are seeing some impact from inflation we believe the efficiencies that were executing against and the impact of foreign exchange translation should offset these headwinds and with that said jane and i would be happy to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions thank you our first question will come from john mcdonald with autonomous research your line is now open john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning mark was hoping that maybe you could unpack the guidance for a little bit more it seems like youve got more good guys than bad guys maintain the guidance but maybe within that could you give us a little bit more color on what youre expecting on net interest income where the trend seems strong and then maybe what youre assuming from market in the back half of the year thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thank you john good morning to you as you said we have seen the benefit certainly in the quarter here of the pickup in rates and certainly all indicators are that the rate increases will likely continue through the balance of the year and as youve heard me say before i do expect that we will see continued growth in loans particularly on the card side and we saw some of that start to play in sooner than expected because i had talked about it being in the back half of the year we saw some of that even here in the second quarter so we do continue to think well get some lift there citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 we also expect to see continued momentum on the services side both in tts and likely in security services as well and that growth is more than just rates but certainly a portion of that does come from rates as well where the pressure is going to come is in the noninterest revenue and we saw that certainly in the quarter here on the investment banking side we saw that obviously in some of the wealth businesses particularly in asia and thats where some of the offset is that wed expect against that nii momentum now the reality i think is that well have to see how this plays out as it relates to markets all the uncertainty thats out there in the environment thus far has played to our favor given our focus on corporate clients and what have you but id tell you that as i look at the full year based on what we know now and with the uncertainty thats out there i continue to feel comfortable with that guidance probably to the higher end of that lowsingle digit growth that ive talked about john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then maybe as a followup just remind us where you are on net interest income sensitivity youve updated the way i think you look at it relative to mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research peers and relative to rates just remind us where you are on that and what kind of deposit pricing assumptions are embedded in that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so important to kind of just level set john great question we got i think there are a couple of drivers that kind of come into play when we think about the sensitivity so one is obviously the mix and so in our case weve got about twothirds of our deposits are wholesale about a third are consumer weve got obviously of ours are in us denominated and the rest are kind of nonus and that mix is important when you think about betas when you think about sensitivity and how they play out particularly in a rising rate environment at the pace that weve seen and that pace varies for both the us versus the nonus currencies and so thats all going to be a factor in kind of how we think about it youre right in our disclosure we forecast our ire disclosure based on a runoff balance sheet assumption and what ive been describing in the past couple of quarters is an approach thats more consistent with peers which assumes a static balance sheet and under that analysis if we were to look at an assumption for basis point parallel shift in rates cross currencies we think that would generate roughly a billion increase in nii now for us thats going to skew towards nonus dollars about of that would be nonus dollar about us dollar and that shift is in part because weve seen already a significant increase in the us weve seen some increase in nonus but nowhere near the magnitude that weve seen in the us so ill stop there hopefully that addresses your question operator thank you our next question will come from glenn schorr with evercore isi your line is now open citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks very much mark i wonder if you could just elaborate on the headwinds in noninterest revenue within pbwm and retail services it sounds to me like you extended a contract for a partner or something like that and then maybe bigger picture in cards you just mentioned rising card loans we all want rising loans but in the backdrop and the economic outlook were facing how do you decipher whats good rise in card loans versus a little concerning rise in card loans mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure let me take them in that order so on the retail services side it has nothing to do with kind of an extension of a contract or anything like that what im describing is that it is a partner business that we have there in retail services and what that means is that theres a sharing of the profits associated with the business that we generate and so what happens is in this rising rate environment and the activity from a volume point of view weve seen an increase in the net interest income that weve generated and what that means is that theres more fortunately more profits to share with our partners the sharing of those profits play through the noninterest revenue line so it comes out as a fee as a contra revenue as we share those with clients so thats the driver of the swing that you see happening there or the pressure that we have in pbwm as it relates to retail services in terms of the cards growth the cards growth we feel very good about it there certainly is an environmental dynamic thats playing out as it relates to consumers and corporates but what i would say is that youve also heard us describing more marketing spend more advertising spend more acquisitions growth in acquisitions weve been targeting growing our customer base there while staying within our risk appetite and the parameters that weve set and been very disciplined about and thats started to pay off and that is part of what id describe in terms of the loan growth that is materializing theres nothing that we see of significance as we grow these loans that would suggest one that theyre outside of the focus that weve had todate because theyre not nor that theres any material risk in terms of outsized losses if you look at our loss rates our loss rates are for branded cards retail services those are of what we would normally what we used to describe as a normal loss rate ncl rate through a cycle and so we feel very good about the loans that were growing theres obviously risk but we also feel very good about the reserves that we have operator thank you operator instruction our next question will come from erika najarian with ubs your line is now open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes hi my first question is actually a followup to johns question mark i think that its always been more challenging to forecast net interest income for citigroup and the net interest income and net interest margin certainly surprised to the upside so i guess let me reask the question appreciate the billion for each basis point in parallel shift but as we think about the us forward curve how should we think about the trajectory of net interest income from that billion from here and clearly as we think about a deposit base thats two thirds wholesale how should we think about both deposit flow deposit growth and deposit beta as we think about the second half of the year in other words does the rate of change quarteroverquarter accelerate flatten out or decelerate citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah theres a lot there but i mean i think what id say is a couple of things one is weve obviously seen a rapid increase in rates and that the speed at which rates increases matters a lot as it relates to the betas and so particularly on the wholesale corporate side and so we have seen betas increase there theyre probably at about to slightly a little bit better than we would have expected but we would expect that momentum to continue in the back half of the year given the forecast for continued rate increases the other thing that id point out just given your point around the ability to forecast from a citi point of view if you look at the first half of the year we did about i think it was billion or so over the prior year exmarkets so nii exmarkets billion yearoveryear first half to give you a bit more guidance on how were thinking about it in light of the rate curve and in light of our mix id tell you that i expect about another billion or so in the back half so thats probably yearoveryear 8ish percent or so on a fullyear basis based on again our mix our assumption around betas and our current assumptions around how the curve would likely play out let me pause there and see if jane wants to add anything to that jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah id also add in our institutional deposits account for about of citis deposit base but of them are operational deposits and the tts deposits have increased by billion since precovid but the operational deposits increased by billion and the nonoperating decreased so with qt on the horizon wed certainly expect the amounts of deposits in the system to shrink we anticipate this would primarily impact nonoperating balances and i think we feel very good about the stickiness of the deposit base weve got and particularly internationally where these are operating accounts that are extremely sticky frankly in all environments mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good point erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you and just my followup question is that was really an impressive capital build this quarter particularly since its been an issue with investors and especially since the scb came out i think a piece that we may be missing as we think about the continued build to is sort of what the cet1 benefit is from slide so similar to sort of the i guess it was basis points accreted from the australia sale is there any way you could give us a range on as the deal close for the philippines thailand bahrain malaysia in the second half of the year how that could boost your cet1 and get you closer to that bogey mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i guess let me kind of answer it in a more fulsome way if you dont mind and then ill certainly make sure that i give you a sense for the contribution of what we expect from divestitures to the capital impact so again there are a couple of drivers that are going to be important to us building to ultimately the for as long as that citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 is place given the scb one is obviously the income generation and with a very strong quarter as it relates to income generation i feel good about the back half of the year as ive just given you some guidance on the other is dont forget weve had basis points on the twoyear since the beginning of the year to the end of the first quarter in terms of rate increases another bps in the second quarter and its going to be there were aoci impacts from that bps in the first quarter and as we point out here another bps in the second theres a pull to par that we expect to start to play out and continue to play out in the balance of the year thats going to be an important factor the third as youve heard us mention is weve been working very hard to optimize our rwa and well continue to do that weve paused the buybacks thats a factor and then as you mentioned the divestitures the close to billion or so in australia ive talked about in the past about billion for the year in terms of capital impact im at about billion with australia is what im currently expecting and so a little bit less than what i had talked about before in part because of some of the movement in terms of the timing of some of these closings still feel good about it just its a difficult market that were managing through so that billion total should give you a sense for how that translates into a cet1 impact that were expecting at least through the balance of this year and obviously thered be more to come as we continue to close out and sign and close out some of the remaining deals jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah i mean i rather suspect that at the end of all of this were going to have an overabundance of capital and i really feel good that citi is already very wellpositioned for any environment and as mark said we have a confluence of various factors going on i mean some of which are temporary that are causing this rapid buildup of capital for the industry but i think were extremely wellpositioned for what lies ahead in terms of strong capital ratios total liquidity resources portfolio credit quality is extremely high well reserved and so we are very much looking forward to resuming share buybacks as i said once weve achieved this build particularly given where were trading and i want you to hear loud and clear that commitment operator thank you our next question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi im trying to figure out if youre lucky or smart and the reason i say that is at your investor day i mean right upfront you said you have five core interconnected businesses led by services led by tts and then a few months later you have your best quarter in a decade and it just seems so coincidental that you highlight that as a growth area and then just a couple of quarters later boom here we are so how much of that tts growth is simply because of oneoff factors in the markets in other words it wont repeat how much of it is due to a higher baseline because of say interest rates and how much of that is due to market share gains and just remind us what tts and security services is again because i think you got everyones attention with this quarter jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 so why dont i kick off and then ill pass it to mark and its a danger here of how long you have mike because theres a lot to talk about so i would encourage you to sit at the beach this weekend and have an excellent read of the supplement because weve provided you with a lot of good facts and proof points and information both around the services businesses and the others about the early progress on the strategy tts was able to fire as i said on all cylinders this quarter about twothirds of the performance was driven by business actions and onethird was by rates and as mark said very active management of the deposit base beta discipline across all the regions and the nir growth that you saw was driven by cards by payments by receivables and by trade when you look in the strategic drivers we laid out at investor day this quarter cross border transaction value up yearoveryear clearing volume up in us dollar commercial comp spend up as that business recovered average trade loan balances up average deposit balances up so that twothirds that was not rates related has a very broad and substantive set of drivers behind it that as mark said puts us into a very strong position for continued momentum here this level of yearoveryear growth is very pleasing but we would expect to see it revert to the mediumterm guidance we gave you at investor day over time but no this was across the board all elements firing and i will give a shout out to shamir the head of tts as well as to our security services team but he has really instituted a culture of intensity of tremendous focus of discipline in how he is running the business as well and i think that is also a contributing factor to the confidence that youre hearing from us about this mark do you want to explain what tts and security services is mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc again as youve heard us describe the tts franchise is core to our business it provides obviously a network to the large multinational clients in over countries we manage the full swath of their working capital and cash management needs we also provide trade financing for them and their vendors and partners and this is essentially in many ways what differentiates our franchise from others and not only is it in and of itself a core growing highreturning business but its one of the businesses that is well connected to the rest of the franchise when you think about the markets business that we have and the fx that we manage on behalf of clients and so and this is a particularly relevant time for us to be engaged with those partners as they manage through supply chain issues and were there to again help them work through those things and provide them alternatives to their production and operations and similar type services we provide to our investor client base from a security services point of view look the strategy here did not start with investor day that is we obviously spent time with you talking about that but this has been a part of the franchise that weve been investing in on an ongoing basis and its important that we continue to do that investments in technology investments in onboarding of new clients and the services we provide in enhanced digital capabilities in the operations so all of those things and some of that what you see here is those investments starting to pay off jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and the same is exactly true in security services so i think the answer to your question is no were just being very disciplined citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes well said operator thank you operator instructions our next question will come from ken usdin with jefferies your line is now open ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hi there thank you good morning just a mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning ken usdin q analyst jefferies company followup on the rwa when you talk about the premium of the billion and can you help us just discern between what is a numerator impact and whats the rwa impact of the sales that have been announced and just as a related just how far are you through the rwa optimization efforts how much more could you really see doing there thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so the thank you the billion i referenced is all capital so all numerator impact is what im describing its both the you know any premium that we get or impact gained from sale as well as the rwa that we have allocated as part of that business and so that all kind of flows through from a numerator point of view in the case of australia for example that would include both the rwa that we had attributed to that business as well as the cta impact coming back into capital so remember we took a hit when we signed the deal associated with the cta i kept communicating that that would neutralize when the deal was closed in fact it did and that contributes to the roughly billion there in terms of rwa optimization efforts its a continuous effort we are constantly working through the balance sheet to make sure that its allocated to clients who generate the highest prospect for growth and leverage the breadth of the franchise and were going to continue to do that and i think the team did a very good job in icg and particularly in markets this quarter in making sure that we made progress against the revenue to rwa metric that theyve been using which is a proxy for returns they worked very closely with clients to manage the recycling of trading inventory in a optimal way to optimize collateral positions and postings that we have to increase initial margins on derivative trading where that makes sense and so theyve been actively working the balance sheet and were going to continue to do that we want to be there to serve our clients but we want to make sure that we are generating an appropriate return for the use of capital jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 and its part of the shift that weve been instituting paco and andy in markets and across icg and across the firm in our commitment to our shareholders to be more returns focused and to be managing the business differently that way and this is a very obvious example of that because its multidimensional operator thank you our next question will come from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just around capital mark this is a twopart question one am i hearing you right that youre not going to leave the door open for buybacks until you get to appreciating what jane said about some of the transitory impact from aoci why not be a bit more opportunistic and just tied to that whats the risk that some of these deals get pushed out i see slide where youve extended the timeline for a few deals given just the macro backdrop like is that a real risk or do you feel pretty good about the updated timelines thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure so look i mean we are obviously going to take it quarterbyquarter as it relates to buybacks and from a capital point of view again without going through all of the things that reflect the environment that were in you can see the uncertainty thats out there obviously the capital requirements with this scb for the industry are higher thats unfortunate we feel as well the right amount of capital was in the industry already weve got to manage through that its a reg requirement were going to do that but well scb gives us the opportunity to take those decisions quarterbyquarter were pausing for now and next year there will be another dfast process and there will be an scb that comes out of that and frankly we should have the strength of higher ppr that weve been generating to help contribute to what that outcome looks like so well take that quarter byquarter in terms of risk related to divestitures again we did highlight were being very very transparent with you all and with the world and we do see some delays that we highlighted from our original schedule thats in the back of the presentation there but we feel very good about getting to closure there and its not an if its a when and we feel like were on track with the schedule that weve highlighted for you operator thank you our next question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is now open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi one more capital question citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so on slide hi on slide you do give the mediumterm outlook here for what you see as your longterm goals for capital the to and so implicit within that is an expectation that your indiscernible would fall to somewhere basis points or so and i get that the exits will be part of that is there a sense you can tell us as you get more simplified what the scb benefit would be i thought it was something like basis points but i must be off there mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc look i mean the to is consistent with what we talked about at investor day and the mediumterm as you know betsy for us is three to five years weve got a couple of things that were working through not the least of which are the divestitures they will certainly contribute to that but so will some of the other things that ive mentioned including utilization of the dta the aoci pullback and things of that sort the divestitures certainly will help from an scb point of view but i think the stronger performance that were seeing will aid in that as well and importantly the mix change that we expect to come from executing on our strategy a mix towards more sustainable predictable earnings earnings that are coming from some of the areas of growth that we demonstrated this quarter like tts and security services et cetera et cetera so theres time there theres obviously a management buffer component of that that i think is certainly an important factor and consideration as we evolve our mix and then theres the gsib score with not only a reduction in the divestitures that will impact peaktotrough losses theres also deposits that will go away with those and balance sheet evolution that will contribute to reduction in gsib score as well jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah let me just underline a couple of points when we built our strategy it wasnt only to generate greater returns but it was to lower our capital requirements over time as mark said and you can see how were executing that both in terms of the shift in mix and the divestitures obviously we dont control the regulatory capital framework but were not managing for shortterm shifts in scb as you know the banks experience considerable variability in the scb each year its very much depending on the scenario chosen so thats why we continue with our commitment and confidence around the mediumterm operator thank you our next question will come from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning jane good morning mark citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i had a followup question for arguably for mark on nii as the fed continues down the path of balance sheet normalization i just wanted to clarify whether that billion increase in nii you cited for the back half assumes stable deposits or some qtrelated attrition and within icg specifically are there any insights you can share on what drove the increase in markets nii and how that should traject just given the historical liability sensitivity within the markets business mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc on the first point when i think about the back half of the year and quantitative tightening i do expect that we will see some continued deposit growth as i mentioned earlier the pressure from quantitative tightening i think will certainly play out over time but again our focus is on growing the operating deposits that we have with clients and we think weve got good traction and ability to continue momentum with those operating deposits and again they put us in a position to really broaden the relationship with both those multinational clients as well as with some of our commercial clients where weve been getting good growth and momentum from so yes likely would be an impact across the industry but we believe we can get some continued momentum particularly on the operating deposits that we have with clients in terms of markets nii i mean youve got the european dividend that plays out in the second quarter so that obviously is a factor there and again id point you to when we talk about markets i really like to talk about total revenues because the nature of the security and the trading and the activity that we do there can have an impact on nii and nir and what really matters is the total revenues that were driving and generating out of that franchise and as you can see we did growth in markets revenue yearoveryear so a very good quarter for the markets team for sure operator thank you our next question will come from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi can you elaborate on your comment about why the russia exposure is kind of less of a risk or its a better mix than it was a few months ago and then maybe related to that quantify how much of the billion is to subsidiaries of mncs which does seem like itd be much much lower risk thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 sure so look what weve been doing very actively since the beginning of the year and certainly in the quarter as well has been working weve been working to bring down our exposure in russia and specifically with the clients that we serve there and so that direct exposure in a local currency dollars we brought down by some million or so in the quarter we brought down and reduced the cash and deposits that we have by another billion or so and then continued to bring down thirdparty related exposure by another million and thats been through working with clients to pay those exposures and loans down and in some instances giving them incentives to do so and incentives to move their deposits out as well so very active engagement from the team as it relates to that whats happened with that is the mix of the exposure that we have or that remains has skewed towards the higherquality names and towards the global subsidiaries that we have in the country and so with that mix shift to better quality names and the reduction in exposure thats allowed for us to take down the reserves that we had related to the direct exposure in the quarter and so that has been i think very good progress in terms of that reduction it gets overshadowed a bit with the ruble impact but weve made good progress and were going to continue to actively do that approximately jane do you want to jump in on that jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah yeah no i was going to jump in in terms of just sort of overall lets be very clear we are systematically crunching down the size of our franchise and as mark says the severe stress loss scenario is probably the best indicator of that which is now roundabout the billion and materially reduced down and we completely changed the nature of our exposure particularly when you think about today most of our clients are multinationals and many of the exposures there have parent guarantees against them which is very helpful what are we doing with them many of them that were helping them with their exit from the countries and that obviously as you can all appreciate takes some time so for those that are able to exit swiftly thats another factor that can help us reduce down our exposure presence and indeed our operations there are also others though that it is harder i think weve all seen how difficult it is to disconnect the russian economy from the west in a couple of key sectors in particular food and in particular energy and as you can imagine given the nature of our bank weve been in the middle of some of those flows that are essential for the west and the multinationals that are supporting it and so you have a bit of a blended story here in terms of yes were helping those that connects to exit but were also still playing the role that we have to and have been asked to in maintaining some of those flows we anticipate that they will continue to reduce over time as the energy and food security issues get addressed but its a complex environment and bottom line you can hear us were pleased with how this has been managed by our teams operator thank you our next question will come from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi jane hi mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mark can you share with us both of you addressed in your opening remarks about the impact the market conditions had on investment banking and your peers have seen it as well if the market conditions remain this way in the second half of the year and into just for investment banking not markets your trading business when do you guys have to take a sharper pencil to the expenses in that division or do you just let it run jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc maybe i kick off and then pass it over to mark look strategic advice is central to the vision to being the preeminent banking partner for multinational firms we are continuing to strategically invest in talent and in the platform you can expect us to continue doing so with a particular focus on the tech healthcare and financial services sectors because those are ones where it is a decadelong shift that were going to see in their importance and weve brought in some very strong bankers there it obviously takes a few years to build share build out the client relationships and to see the full fruits of those investments were also focused on the broader opportunity by leveraging investments in commercial banking im sure mark will talk about that as well and in markets and the connectivity there so i think youre going to see us take a strategic look at this and a longterm look rather than just a shooting from the hip on the expenses side because were building the firm for the longterm here well certainly be incredibly disciplined around expenses youve seen that with us this quarter weve talked about what well do on expenses across the board in the firm as we become simpler in tackling stranded costs our organization structure et cetera but were very serious about the investments that were making into some of the core talent in these areas and you shouldnt be expecting us to make any significant material shifts right or left on this one were deadly serious mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc jane i think thats well said the only thing i would add is that the business is capital light and is high returning through the cycle and so we see a lot of value there we want to be prepared to ramp up when activity starts again and as youve said its quite strategic for us since you kind of wound me up on the commercial banking activity i have to jump at it we had as you know jane a very strong quarter in commercial banking when i look at the revenue momentum there just kind of leveraging the breadth of the franchise were probably up to in revenues in that part of the business and i know thats part of our as you know thats part of our core growth strategy that we talked about at investor day so good momentum in that part of the franchise as well jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and obviously theyre benefits for our investment banking colleagues as well mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 those synergies jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc important synergies mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah operator thank you our next question will come from vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is now open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you jane a question for you on mexico given the comments of the mexican president would that limit the price that a buyer would be willing to pay and whats your sort of minimum price that youre willing to accept and whats plan b if the prices being bid dont meet that hurdle jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc oh vivek im not going to answer your question but ill give you a few comments on mexico nonetheless so were pleased with the interest in our mexican franchise based on the discussions with the buyers and the franchise is performing well its more than maintaining its value its contributing nicely to our financial results but its still very early in this process so when we have news for you we will obviously convey that to you swiftly but its early days and as youd expect with a transaction of this nature we need to work through a variety of regulatory and legal proceedings were actively doing so were working hard on separating our marketleading institutional franchise which is a key part of our global network taking the time necessary to do that the right way and we have a variety of different options that we can always look at but its far too early in the process here to speculate but so far so good operator thank you our next question will come from andrew lim with société générale your line is now open andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi good morning thanks for taking my question i guess id like to have a better view from you on your outlook on recession it is difficult to reconcile how investors feel about recession it is obviously quite negative and seemingly a lot more negative than it was about a quarter ago but when we look at you and at some of your peers the delta on the recession outlook seems only a little bit worse than it was one quarter ago so i was just wondering how you think about recession because some of the investors that we talk to they look at the savings citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 ratio its back to prepandemic levels they look at mortgage affordability and its really quite dire and the perception they have is obviously perhaps inconsistent with the way youre looking at recession so perhaps you can give us a bit of color as to how youre thinking about things jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah ill kick it off pass it to mark look as weve talked about the current macro environment is kind of shaped by the three rs russia rates and recession and it depends where in the world you are as to which ones prevailing in the us were more concerned about rates than imminent recession the consumer and the corporate are healthy the labor market is exceedingly tight we are increasingly concerned about the possibility of a recession next year but i think what youre hearing from us quite loud and clear is that we think the economy is quite wellpositioned to withstand it europe different story fragility of their energy supply to any further shocks makes it more vulnerable and its kind of at the center of the storm so we do believe that the continent is heading into a recession under the most likely scenario and could be as early as this fall in asia concerns are largely focused around china and its zero covid policy the economy is bouncing back but you could have another wave that could be more problematic there so and you put all these different factors its a little bit depends where in the world that you are when i think about citi look were prepared for a variety of scenarios we are absolutely ready we run stress tests all the time given the unique set of risks facing the global economy right now we have a set of playbooks honed over many years that can get instituted as necessary and what matters for a bank heading into a recession capital liquidity credit quality and reserves and we feel very good about all four of them very strong capital ratios as youve seen ending total liquidity resources just shy of trillion over of our corporate exposures are investment grade our consumer clients are heavily prime and lets just talk a little bit about the icg ncl this quarter when you look at the numbers it was million only the health of the corporate entering into the choppy waters is extremely strong and weve got a very well reserve to funded loan ratio of so we have a lot of flexibility here if we have a severe recession i think youll see certain actions taken indiscernible but as a bank were ready for a whole variety of different scenarios mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah jane just to your point on reserves just in the quarter you saw we took a reserve build that reserve build was in part driven by our view on the potential for some downside in light of everything that were seeing and the concerns around recession so we did take a bit of a build from a cecl point of view on reserves and as jane mentioned we feel very good about our reserves levels and the billion that we have associated with our franchise jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah i think the consumer its just an unusual situation to be entering into this choppy environment when you have a consumer with strong health and such a tight labor market and i think thats where you hear so many of us not so much concerned about an imminent recession in the states operator thank you our next question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is now open citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi can you hear me jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes we can mike hello again mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi before i had my beach reading thank you for that look to regain investor credibility youve mentioned meeting various proof points and can you remind us which proof points youve met but which proof points we should hold you accountable to looking ahead in the next quarter and year jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc look i think you hold us accountable for all the different proof points we laid out we went through a very thoughtful process to come up with the different kpis for the strategy and those are transparently put into the materials were trying to make it as shareholder and investorfriendly as possible in that respect and if you can see this quarter the drivers exceeded expectations in some places there were headwinds in others we laid them out very clearly you saw as we talked about services so i dont need to cover that one again in markets we talked about optimizing rwa driving the business for stronger capital productivity also driving more of the alpha trade solution business you see that personal banking returning to ieb and revenue growth from customer acquisition and purchase sales being important metrics investment banking its progress on key hires that weve been making thats obviously been a tough market to do so but ive been pleased with the talent that weve brought in and delighted with the talent that we have wealth was more challenged with lockdowns in asia understandably slowing some progress on client acquisitions and some of the key strategy drivers there but synergies more disciplined tighter processes reinforced by additional metrics on the scorecard youll be hearing us talking more and more about the delivery of those synergies so its not really any different from exactly what we laid out on investor day right weve laid out a strategy we have a lot of conviction around weve laid out the different metrics to hold us accountable to and it should provide you a sense of progress along the way and weve also talked about what were doing to get this cultural change of accountability of urgency of intensity and excellence and well give you as many different indicators of where thats working well and where its not as we go along mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc if i could just add one thing to that jane and that mike i think you ought to keep in mind that this is a very strong quarter for us we feel very good about it but its just a quarter jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 yeah mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc right and we talked about at investor day a longterm strategy and we gave you a sense for mediumterm targets and those things are going to be things that you hold us accountable between now and then right and so this is one quarter we feel great about it were certainly glad that youre recognizing it but theres a lot more wood to chop were making a lot of investments in the franchise that we know are going to pay dividends in the future and we look forward to kind of talking through continued progress in these kpis it wont always be a straight line but we remain confident that were going to get there jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah and we fully recognize the magnitude of what we have to do and were determined to get this done operator thank you our next question will come from vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is now open jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hi vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi jane dont worry i wont trip you up on another one you cant answer hopefully jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc i didnt say cant i said wont theres a big difference vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc wont okay yeah okay wont hopefully this one you will mark your nii growth for full year is there something in the second quarter that was unusually high that we should not carry forward im just trying to reconcile that with the guide that youve given because if we just take that forward it would be above the so trying to reconcile whats the difference mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc look i mean each of the quarters obviously have different dynamics different rate moves different levels of volume growth and what have you and so theres certainly different volume levels between quarter and quarter and i described kind of how rates would move between the quarters as well and so to simplify it and because there is appropriate interest in how we think about it on an exmarkets basis i just gave you the annualization of the half and what it would mean for the full year so nothing that i would point out beyond what you would notice which is differences in rates and volumes across the businesses citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the all over to jen landis for closing remarks jennifer
