corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 jane nind fraser chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you jenn and a very good morning to everyone well we certainly live in interesting times and while i usually start our calls with our views on the global macro environment were particularly proud of our progress this quarter and so i shall start there indeed in a pivotal year this quarter contains multiple proof points that we are moving in the right direction and that our strategy is delivering concrete results we saw revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the firm and across all five businesses our businesses performed well as the ratecutting cycle began with a double digit increase in feebased revenues reflecting the growing diversity of our earnings mix we continue to have share gains in services and banking in wealth we saw a sizable increase in client investment and flows we brought expenses down whilst continuing to invest in our transformation and businesses and we continued to attract the top leaders in the industry and successfully combined them with our own teams in banking and wealth so while we are not yet where we want to be the impact of the changes were making is clearly evident in our momentum and our improving performance turning to the macro now our growth is a notch slower than last year global economic performance continues to be surprisingly resilient whatever you want to call the us landing the sentiment around it is more optimistic supported by the recent positive payrolls report and we see a healthy yet more discerning us consumer and the us corporate sector on its front foot manufacturing weakness is restraining a modest rebound in europe which continues to struggle with more structural challenges around its competitiveness as highlighted by draghis report and in china consumer sentiment in the property market remain a concern as markets await details on the expected fiscal stimulus india asean japan the middle east mexico and brazil are all notable bright spots globally today we reported net income of billion and earnings per share of with an rotce of overall revenues grew by ex divestitures with each of our core businesses delivering growth and positive operating leverage while we continue to make substantial investments in our transformation the efficiencies gained from our simplification and other efforts drove a reduction in overall expenses turning to the five businesses services delivered a record quarter with revenues up by fee growth the best indicator of underlying momentum was significant and this combined with loan and deposit volume growth drove this quarters excellent performance treasury and trade solutions was up yearoveryear reflecting good underlying momentum in the core drivers and securities services was up reflecting the benefit of new mandates and an increase in assets under custody both tts and securities services achieved over wallet share in our target markets through the first half of the year last week we announced that we are the first global bank to complete the integration of our crossborder services with mastercard move now this will ultimately enable near instant secure payments to the vast mastercard debit network starting with markets with more to come early next year and this is another great example of our continued investment in market leading innovations in markets revenues were up slightly on the back of a better than expected september equities was up with robust performance across all products our continued strong performance in equities validates both our strategy and execution to grow prime and cash citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 fixed income however was down our rates and currencies business didnt match last years standout performance it was a particularly pleasing quarter in banking despite the muted ipo market investment banking fees are up thats driven by investment grade debt issuance as our clients pulled forward activity ahead of the us election corporate sentiment remains positive as boards pursue strategic transactions such as the billion mars acquisition of kellanova where we are the sole advisor and the lead financier our strategy in banking continues to gain momentum we are steadily growing our share in key target sectors such as healthcare and tech with a healthy pipeline ahead and a significant upside of our franchise continues to attract the top talent to citi during the quarter we announced an innovative billion private credit partnership with our longtime client apollo giving us the ability to source new transactions without using our balance sheet this partnership positions us with another solution for debt financing for our clients and it allows us to engage in private credit with the same debts and expertise as we currently do with syndicated debt markets we are also starting to see the positive impact of the significant changes weve implemented in our wealth franchise with revenues up its a notable example of the traction that i referenced earlier as andy and the team intensify the focus on our investment business we grew client investment assets by and we were particularly pleased with the performance in asia and in citigold i continue to be excited by the opportunities and the sheer potential of our franchise during the quarter we signed an agreement to exit trust administration and fiduciary services as we continue to sharpen the focus of our wealth business we have more to do to reach our mediumterm margin and return targets but this quarter is a good indicator that we are on the way there us personal banking revenues were up we grew branded cards revenues by with account acquisitions spend and payment rates all driving higher interest earning balances lower discretionary spending is impacting our retail services portfolio however we continue to see lower payment rates contributing to interest earning balances in retail banking we are growing our mortgage portfolio as the rate environment shifts as well as growing overall loans the us consumer dynamics remain remarkably consistent with prior quarters our customers are healthy but more discerning in their spend with signs of stress isolated to the lower ficos weve maintained strong credit discipline and our card portfolios continue to perform very much in line with our expectations in terms of capital while uncertainty about the basel iii endgame prevails our capital position remains very robust and we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of during the quarter we returned billion in capital including the repurchase of billion of common shares we will continue to repurchase stock as we evaluate the right level on a quarterly basis as you know our transformation is our number one priority this quarter we closed another longstanding consent order which related to the effectiveness of our antimoney laundering systems we have increased our investment in areas where we have not made sufficient progress such as data quality management i and the management team remain steadfast and determined to get this transformation right and to get this done citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 we will close out this pivotal year with momentum and with determination to continue to improve performance in each business and the firm overall we are committed to meeting our revenue and expense targets for the year as well as our return target for the medium term i am very proud of our senior leadership and the entire organization as we demonstrate the potential of our unique global franchise it is a privilege to lead this firm with that i would like to turn it over to mark and then we will be delighted as always to take your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks jane and good morning everyone im going to start with the firmwide financial results focusing on year overyear comparisons for the third quarter unless i indicate otherwise and then spend a little more time on the businesses on slide we show financial results for the full firm for the quarter we reported net income of approximately billion eps of and an rotce of on billion of revenue total revenues were up on a reported basis excluding divestiture related impacts revenues were up driven by growth across each of our businesses as you can see on the bottom left side of the page net interest income excluding markets was down year overyear largely due to lower interest rates in argentina and noninterest revenue excluding markets was up as we continued to see strong fee momentum across services banking and wealth yeartodate revenues were up on a reported basis and are up excluding divestiture related impacts expenses were billion down largely driven by savings associated with our organizational simplification and stranded cost reductions partially offset by volumerelated expenses and continued investments in the transformation and other risk and control initiatives yeartodate expenses were up primarily driven by the fdic special assessment and civil money penalties cost of credit was billion largely driven by net credit losses in cards as well as acl builds across the businesses primarily for portfolio growth and mix at the end of the quarter we had over billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately and yeartodate excluding the divestiture related impacts we generated positive operating leverage for the firm and reported an rotce of on slide we show the expense trend over the past five quarters this quarter we reported expenses of billion down and sequentially as weve said before we will continue to increase our investments to address data governance and data quality related to regulatory reporting and are committed to spending whatever is necessary to address these areas and the transformation more broadly although a lot more work remains weve started to see benefits from our prior investments play through weve continued to simplify our technology infrastructure retiring over applications yeartodate and now over since our investor day weve upgraded of our over atms in north america and asia pacific to nextgen software for better customer security and monitoring and weve streamlined our cloud onboarding process reducing time to onboard applications to the public cloud from over seven weeks to two weeks each of these initiatives will result in both improvement of our operating efficiency and our safety and soundness citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 and in terms of our full year expenses we continue to expect that we will be at the higher end of the guidance range of billion to billion excluding the fdic special assessment and civil money penalties and as weve said before we of course will continue to look for opportunities to absorb the civil money penalties on slide we show net interest income loans and deposits where ill speak to sequential variances in the third quarter net interest income declined excluding markets net interest income was up largely driven by volume growth in uspb as well as higher deposit spreads in services and wealth nim declined by basis points driven by a decline in markets due to seasonally higher dividends in the second quarter average loans were up driven by growth in services and uspb partially offset by modest declines in banking and legacy franchise average deposits were roughly flat as growth in services was largely offset by a decline in legacy franchise and as you think about guidance for nii ex markets in the fourth quarter as shortend rates continue to come down we expect a headwind on floating rate assets which will be somewhat offset by disciplined deposit pricing further offsetting that will be a continued benefit from securities being reinvested at higher yields and as a reminder we expect an ongoing nii headwind as legacy franchises loans and deposits continue to come down so taking all of this into account we expect nii exmarkets to be roughly flat sequentially in the fourth quarter and for the full year to be slightly down better than we had previously guided on slide we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics which reflect our disciplined risk appetite framework across our cards portfolio approximately of our loans are to consumers with fico scores of or higher based on what we see the us consumer continues to remain healthy and resilient trend in payment rates continue to normalize and underlying credit performance remains broadly in line with our expectations ncls increased yearoveryear as card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years continue to mature at the same time sequentially ncls declined while delinquencies increased both in line with historical third quarter seasonality absent this seasonality we continue to see stabilization in early stage delinquencies we remain wellreserved with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately for our us cards portfolio our corporate portfolio is largely investment grade and corporate nonaccrual loans remained low at basis points as such we feel very comfortable with the over billion of total reserves that we have in the current environment turning to slide we provide details on our balance sheet capital and liquidity which are a reflection of our risk appetite strategy and business model our trillion deposit base is welldiversified across regions industries customers and account types billion are corporates spanning countries and are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world the majority of our remaining deposits about billion are well diversified across the private bank citigold retail and wealth at work offerings and of our total deposits roughly are us dollar denominated with the remainder spanning over currencies our asset mix also reflects our strong risk appetite framework our billion loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans in the quarter deposit growth outpaced loan growth resulting in higher cash balances which contributed to available liquidity resources of approximately billion we continue to feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our assets and liabilities which position us well to serve our clients and execute on our growth strategy citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 on slide we show the sequential cet1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter first we generated billion of net income to common shareholders which added basis points second we returned billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases which drove a reduction of basis points third we generated basis points from unrealized afs gains and finally the remaining basis point reduction was driven by an increase in rwa as we continue to invest in accretive growth opportunities we ended the third quarter with a preliminary cet1 capital ratio of relative to our target of as a reminder effective october our new cet1 capital ratio requirement is and we still plan on holding basis point management buffer on top of that for now as we think about the coming quarters there are a few things that we will continue to consider as we manage our capital levels including client demand as well as how the macro and basel iii endgame evolves we will take all of this into account as it relates to capital levels and the level of share repurchases on a quarterbyquarter basis turning to the businesses on slide in services revenues were up reflecting continued momentum across securities services and tts both of which continue to gain share through the first half of this year net interest income was roughly flat as the benefit of higher deposit volume was largely offset by a decline in interest rates in argentina on a sequential basis net interest income was up driven by volume growth as we continue to onboard high quality operating deposits and the benefit from higher deposit spreads noninterest revenue increased driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in argentina as well as continued strength in underlying fee drivers in tts and securities services excluding the impact of the argentine peso devaluation nir increased driven by growth in crossborder transaction us dollar clearing volume and commercial card volume expenses increased primarily driven by investments in technology other risk and controls and product innovation including the expansion of the citidirect commercial banking platform into additional markets cost of credit was million primarily driven by a build related to unremittable corporate dividends being held on behalf of clients average loans increased primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance as well as working capital loans average deposits increased as we continue to see growth in operating deposits services generated positive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately billion and continues to deliver a high rotce coming in at for the quarter and yeartodate on slide we show the results for markets for the third quarter markets revenues were up driven by growth in equities partially offset by a decline in fixed income equities revenues increased driven by momentum in prime with balances up approximately growth in derivatives and higher cash volume fixed income revenues decreased driven by rates and currencies which was down partially offset by spread products and other fixed income which was up while rates and currencies declined from last year which was the strongest third quarter in the previous years we did see good momentum in fx from increased corporate client activity spread products and other fixed income was higher driven by financing securitization volumes and underwriting fees partially offset by lower commodities on lower gas volatility expenses increased primarily due to higher volumerelated expenses cost of credit was million driven by an acl build primarily related to portfolio mix and spread products average loans increased largely driven by assetbacked lending in spread products citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 as well as margin loans in equity average trading account assets increased largely driven by client demand for us treasuries foreign government securities and mortgagebacked securities markets generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately billion with an rotce of for the quarter and yeartodate on slide we show the results for banking for the third quarter banking revenues were up largely driven by growth in investment banking investment banking revenues were up and fees were up with increases across debt capital markets advisory and equity capital markets dcm benefited from continued strong investment grade issuance advisory benefited from strong announced deal volume earlier this year and in ecm we saw stronger followon activity which was offset by fewer ipos amid market volatility in august both yeartodate and in the quarter weve driven wallet share gain including in the healthcare and technology sectors where weve been investing corporate lending revenues excluding marktomarket on loan hedges increased primarily driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in argentina expenses decreased primarily driven by benefits of head count reduction as we continue to rightsize the workforce and expense base cost of credit was million driven by an acl build primarily for portfolio mix changes average loans decreased as we maintained strict discipline around returns banking generated positive operating leverage for the third quarter in a row and delivered net income of million with an rotce of for the quarter and yeartodate on slide we show the results for wealth for the third quarter as you can see from our performance this quarter were making good progress against our strategy and expect that momentum to continue revenue was up driven by a increase in nir as we grew investment fee revenues on momentum in client investment assets which grew nii increased driven by higher deposit volumes and spreads expenses decreased driven by the continued benefit of head count reduction as we rightsize the workforce and expense base cost of credit was million largely driven by net credit losses of million end of period client balances increased driven by higher client investment assets and deposits both in north america and internationally average deposits increased reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposit from uspb partially offset by a shift in deposit to higher yielding investments on citis platform average loans decreased as we continued to optimize capital usage wealth generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of million with an rotce of for the quarter and yeartodate on slide we show the results for us personal banking for the third quarter us personal banking revenues were up driven by nii growth of and lower partner payment branded cards revenues increased with interest earning balances growth of as payment rates continue to normalize and we continue to see growth in spend volume which were up retail services revenues were down due to a slowing growth rate in interest earning balance retail banking revenues decreased driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business expenses decreased driven by continuous productivity focus partially offset by higher volumerelated expenses cost of credit was billion largely driven by net credit losses and a modest build for volume citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 growth we continue to expect branded cards to be in the to ncl range for the full year in retail services we continue to expect to be around the high end of the to range for the full year driven by both the impact of persistent inflation and high interest rates as well as lower sales activity at our partners average deposits decreased largely driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business uspb generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of million with an rotce of for the quarter and yeartodate as weve said before the uspb segment creates a lot of value for the firm we knew would be a tough year as we lapped the credit costs but we have a path to higher returns we will continue to drive revenue growth through product innovation while improving the operating efficiency of the business and at the same time we expect the credit environment to normalize all of which will ultimately drive uspb to a high teens return over the medium term on slide we show results for all other on a managed basis which includes corporateother and legacy franchises and excludes divestiturerelated items revenues decreased primarily driven by closed exits and winddowns as well as margin compression on mortgage securities that have extended expenses were down as the reduction from closed exits and winddowns was partially offset by a legal reserve and cost of credit was million largely driven by net credit losses and an acl build in mexico slide shows our full year outlook and mediumterm guidance we generated billion of revenue yeartodate driven by nir ex markets growth of and are on track to meet our billion to billion full year guidance as i mentioned we now expect nii exmarkets to be slightly down for the full year and with yeartodate expenses of billion excluding the fdic special assessment and civil money penalties we continue to expect to be on the higher end of our full year guidance range as we take a step back the third quarter represents another quarter of solid progress and a set of proof points towards improving firm wide and business performance we remain focused on continuing to improve our performance and executing on our transformation these priorities remain critical to strengthening our operations and becoming a more efficient agile and clientcentric company as we continue to make progress on achieving our mediumterm targets with that jane and i will be happy to take your questions citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 question and answer section operator at this time we will open the floor for questions operator instructions okay our first question will come from glenn schorr with evercore your line is now open please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much good guidance i appreciate it im curious on the card losses and retail financial services if you could talk to like the exit rate seems like it will be higher than the full year guide at maybe you could talk to the trajectory there and then the huge reserves that you have built in there and anything you can tell us about the portfolios so we can keep expectations in the right spot thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure why dont i take that good morning glenn so a couple things so one i think that on retail services youre seeing a couple of things kind of play out so one youre seeing kind of spend volumes trend down a bit you are seeing payment rates come down as well that obviously is fueling the average interest earning balance growth that were seeing and then you are also seeing with the spend volume come down theres a denominator effect that plays through which pushes up obviously the loss rates that were seeing that still in the quarter is in line with our guidance but in light of what we saw earlier in the year and normal seasonality we would expect that number to be on the higher end of that range and likely higher in the fourth quarter but the higher in the fourth quarter again depends on what traffic is like and what the holiday spending season looks like through the end of the year i would say the reserve levels we have are very healthy as it relates to this portfolio i think in the back of the deck we show kind of the reserve to loan ratio at about or so so wellreserved for the retail services portfolio in light of the environment that were in similarly we are seeing the stabilization from a delinquency point of view across both portfolios kind of play through and so netnet we are obviously actively managing this the retail partner activity is a critical component of it and that will drive fourth quarter activity or levels but we do feel as if well end up on the higher end of the range here glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay thanks for all that mark just one quickie on your partnership with apollo very interesting and in line with a lot of other things weve seen curious on how you thought about going with one specific partner versus a group and then more importantly are there other parts of the franchise that could benefit with stronger ties to private markets im thinking specifically in the assetbacked world appreciate it thank you jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah so were delighted to partner with apollo because what this does is its uniting our comprehensive banking reach and expertise together and its enabling us to offer our clients more innovative and tailored financing solutions there will be some other partners involved in this as well mubadala is another participant in this citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 and when we look at this its very very beneficial for our clients were always looking at how we can best serve our clients give them the most options and this platform enhances corporate and sponsor clients access to the private lending capital pool at real scale in billion is a very sizable partnership here and it provides funding certainty and strategic transactions its exclusive for lbos noninvestment grade in the us the us is obviously the bulk of the private credit market the bms globally it would be great to see that market developing in europe and it wouldnt surprise me to see us doing more partnerships and other pieces going forward operator our next question will come from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is now open please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess maybe mark for you like looking at slide on nii and maybe we can break it down into markets and exmarkets in the exmarkets nii billion this quarter based on what youve said the back book repricing deposit flex is it safe to conclude that the exmarkets nii bottomed in and i noticed the securities yield actually went lower bps quarteroverquarter so was there something oneoff that impacted the yield this quarter relative to the expectations you outlined earlier mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes so when you look at slide you got a couple of things playing through so your point around the low number the low print billion in the second quarter that really is a combination relative to first quarter of fx translation some seasonally lower card balances and lower interest payments in argentina playing through that sequential to the third quarter as i mentioned earlier is really a byproduct of volumes on the lending side and spreads deposit spreads in services and wealth and i think that ive already given kind of the guide for the fourth quarter where that is likely to be flat but i think its important to just remind everyone of the headwinds and tailwinds that play through this nii line and from a tailwind point of view i would expect to see continued volume from loans uspb in particular but also services and were talking exmarkets so services id also expect to see continued benefit from the reinvestment of securities at higher yields and then were actively managing beta as it relates to with our clients and if you think about kind of what we saw in the uptick of rates were actively managing that on the down tick as it relates to our institutional clients i think the other point here is lets not forget that our interest rate sensitivity skews more towards nonus and so a lot of what we think about and talk about tends to be how us rates move and the betas around that were still going to have a bit of beta catchup outside of the us and so thats one of the headwinds there as well as the legacy franchise exits so youve got this longwinded way of saying i do expect flat into the fourth quarter im not going to give guidance for but what i will say is to keep the growth momentum to get to our mediumterm targets thats to of a cagr and thats going to be a combination of nii and nir but skewing nir and i want to point that out because the third quarter and the yeartodate numbers that you see in our performance shows very strong fee nir growth across each of these five businesses and i dont want to lose sight of that as you all really citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 try to get a handle on how we get to that medium term were evidencing that shift towards more fee revenue as we speak so ill stop there but i think thats important and hopefully ive answered your question around the nii forecast here ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and agreed on the fee momentum just one quick on the wealth segment weve seen a considerable progress yeartodate in terms of going from zero roe to about rotce significant operating leverage i think i heard jane say that momentum should continue is it fair to assume that rotce remains like wealth remains a positive story as we think about how citis roe continues to improve from here as we get towards the target any color on the wealth side would be helpful thank you jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes i agree with you i think were all very pleased to see the progress on the strategy we laid out at investor day the wealth target we have in the medium term is to and with that a to operating margin and were making steady progress there i think the first piece was putting the pieces of the global wealth organization together and now were focused on positioning for growth and reshaping the business to deliver the returns that we all expect a very important part of that is shifting our mix by growing investments we had growth in client investment assets this quarter i would call that a good start to realizing the potential that we have here and at the same time andy continues to rightsize our expense base and drive productivity our advisor productivity increased over in citigold north america so a number of different areas that hes focused on so that we can continue to grow the investment space including some important new talent that weve been bringing in that im sure youve noticed operator our next question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo your line is now open please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi what assurance can you give that citi can both meet its expense guide the billion to billion and i note the yeartodate run rate implies billion so getting from that billion run rate down to the billion to billion by and meet its regulatory targets in other words assurance that citi can both walk and chew gum at the same time and i guess id highlight as you know on october senator warren asked the occ to impose growth restrictions because citi is too big to manage i would assume you dont agree with that but still the question that a lot of people have is what assurances can you give that an asset cap wont happen at citigroup thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks mike so why dont i start with your expense question and im sure jane will chime in on some of the other parts of your question so look we put out medium term targets of billion to billion in revenue dependent of course and thats consistent with the target we gave of less than efficiency ratio and weve got a target this year as you know on the high end of billion and so weve got to get from citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 billion down to billion to billion by im not giving guidance for but you can expect that that will likely glide down to that number whats driving the reduction so weve talked before about billion in savings largely related to the restructuring and driving down head count reduction associated with that we talked about another million to billion related to expense reductions from eliminating stranded cost as we continue to exit were out of nine of these consumer countries already and we talk about starting to see efficiencies and benefits from the investments and the transformation and technology towards the end of and those are the three drivers that are important for us to continue to realize between now and will there be headwinds yes there will be the transformation is a multiyear process were also investing in risk controls and regulatory spend to support improving our operations of course there will be headwinds but there will also be things that we shift away from there will be tailwinds associated with it jane mentioned some of the productivity efforts that both andy as well as vis are pushing on you look across these businesses and you see positive operating leverage across the board so that means that andy morton as well as gonzalo are too looking at their cost structures at expenses that they can take out or productivity that they might improve and so there will be additional costs that we have to incur we incurred additional costs this year but there will also be additional productivity savings that we continue to tease out to ensure that we get to these targets jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and mike let me pick up on part of the second part of the question in terms of the progress on the transformation as you know and as marks talked to you about the transformation reverses historic underinvestment in citis infrastructure it enhances our risk and control environment and its a strategic overhaul as weve talked about that goes well beyond the consent order to simplify and to strengthen citi to the benefit of all of the stakeholders we have we are already a very different citi today weve made enormous change over the past three years dramatically simpler business model significant org change so we align our structure to that model we now have a flatter organization with greater accountability and as mark talked about through the investments in our transformation were focused on simplifying our operational model modernizing our infrastructure risk and controls and all of that reduces risk as we go were well on the way in executing the transformation plans weve made meaningful progress as was acknowledged publicly by one of our regulators and its a wide range book of work weve made significant strides in areas such as risk management compliance and accountability and thats well beyond the big bodies of work about consolidating our platforms so we had retired since as mark mentioned other areas of progress enhance our stress testing capabilities theyre faster more frequent more precise assessment we put in place new target operating models for wholesale credit risk enterprise risk price risk firm wide a huge body of work reducing risk and high risk processes such as payments and markets through systemic preventative controls weve been implementing the ph zing platform this is the strategic cloud solution for market risk analytics values trades on demand and at scale and weve embedded risk and controls into our performance management framework and tied that to compensation for the full firm so these are just giving you a flavor of these big body of work that we are executing and getting done indiscernible i was very pleased that we closed the frb amlbsa consent order particularly given heightened risk and scrutiny in this area that is the third consent order weve closed since and weve been very transparent citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 where there are areas in which our execution is delayed against our original timelines as is the case with our data work we take a step back determine what we need to change in those areas and get back on track and make relevant tech and people investments so i feel very confident about the strategy weve laid out for the firm the deliberate path were on the huge progress weve already made and that we will continue making with determination and with clarity going forward mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so just one followup when and you do have the amended consent order thats not new anymore but is this a problem with your dealing with clients or is this an issue with giving the regulators the information that they need and just again you dont just to confirm you dont have an asset cap now is it fair to assume that you dont expect an asset cap any time soon or could you have an asset cap and we dont even know about that thanks jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc we dont have any problems dealing with our clients quite the opposite were a source of strength for our clients in terms of the provision of their payments businesses their trading businesses the consumer credit businesses all across the board so i would say quite the opposite we are a source of tremendous strength for them and you see that in the results of this quarter which were very pleasing across the board in every single one of our businesses we are working closely with our regulators we incorporate their feedback as well as our own lessons learned if we fall behind in an element of the consent orders but do understand the breadth of the consent order work as i laid out and the meaningful progress were making across multiple areas and when we fall behind in an area we increase the investments needed and look at any lessons learned in the approach and address it so i feel very comfortable mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so again we dont have were not talking about issues as it relates to client information client data client reporting were not talking about information as it relates to financials were talking about regulatory reporting all right and regulatory reporting as ive mentioned in prior calls were a global firm weve got over regulatory reports and were talking about ensuring that the data that we capture at trade entry is the data thats required to ultimately show up on these various regulatory reports in the way that we need it ensuring that weve got the proper controls on that front end so we dont have to do a lot of the reconciliation and manual adjustments to that data in order to get it how we need it in the report and ensuring that we have standardized rules and controls around that process so that we can do it as efficiently as possible but this is largely around ensuring that we improve those regulatory reports that we have to produce by starting with the underlying data thats required to do that operator our next question will come from jim mitchell with seaport global your line is now open please go ahead jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning mark consensus expectations and its just another expense question in a different way but consensus has you not hitting your revenue growth targets and youre certainly free to disagree and i think thats citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 fine but they also have your expenses at the high end of your billion to billion range in i guess does that make sense or do you feel confident that if revenues do sort of disappoint your targets that you could come in at the you should or can come in at the lower end of that range to help get to your rotce target mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so lets take it in pieces so i think the first thing is that i think jane and i have been very consistent with trying to give guidance on full year performance for the past couple years and weve largely actually delivered on that guidance if you look at the top line growth since investor day its largely consistent with what we talked about in the medium term if you look at the expense guidance that weve given largely consistent with that including this year even as i look at the billion to billion revenue guidance we gave for the year and you look at the billion that weve done yeartodate and you think about what we have to deliver in order to hit that target that is achievable particularly when you remember that we had a large argentina devaluation last year that fee momentum required in the fourth quarter is very achievable and we believe that we will obviously hit the high end of the range for as i think about that outer year period and the guidance that we gave there look you all want proof points before you actually believe that we can deliver on that medium term target im pointing you to proof points im hopeful that as you see those proof points through full year and each of the quarters that you will start to believe in that revenue momentum thats required in the medium term the fee revenue is a very good indicator what we delivered this year and this quarter is a very good indicator of the momentum we should see across these businesses in the next couple years i also hope that you would then see that as we deliver on the expense target that we have a path to continuing to deliver on the mediumterm expense target the drivers of which i mentioned earlier yes if revenues come in short of the target that weve set for ourselves you would naturally expect for the volume and transaction related expenses and compensation expenses to come down in a commensurate way with that revenue decline and you would also expect that we would look to see if there are other productivity opportunities that we can tease out in order to still deliver on that operating efficiency target that weve set for ourselves jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc no thats great color i appreciate it and maybe just as a followup on the capital question i guess one thing thats been a bit of a headwind over the last year has been sort of growth from the dta deductions do we start to see that become a tailwind again how do we think about that accreting back into capital over the next couple of years mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look the main driver of our dta utilization will be driving higher income in the us thats going to be the major driver and as we think about so as you think about each of the strategies that jane has described for our business you will often hear the importance of winning in the us youll hear it as it relates to banking and the activity that we saw the strong performance we saw this quarter indiscernible you hear it as it relates to the wealth business and the importance of us growing investments particularly in north america you see it in uspb which is largely a us focused business that dta utilization is about us increasing net income or higher net income in the us and as we work to execute on our client driven strategy we are looking for citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 opportunities to do that were incenting the business to drive that momentum and thats whats going to give us a higher utilization on a quarter by quarter in the coming years operator our next question will come from erika najarian with ubs your line is now open please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi i think weve mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc slid over to the afternoon good afternoon guys the first one is for you jane as i speak with longer term investors they often offer the commentary that clearly the path from the rotce this quarter to the to hopefully will be bridged and to be able to initiate a position before that progress is made they really sort of want to see more capital optimization and this question is not really the same question i ask you about buybacks every quarter but really maybe a progress update on banamex so there is chatter in the market about banamex needed to have four quarters of separate financials before being ipoed and im wondering if you could give us specific progress on how thats going and mark maybe remind us on what banamexs contribution is as we think about the unlocking that excess capital versus taking it out of the pl jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah id be delighted to erika and i would also just before i jump into banamex point to a laser focus on capital optimization its been a mantra for a long time in our markets business in banking and a discipline that weve driven throughout the organization and i would say there isnt anyone at citi that is not keenly aware of the focus around optimizing our capital returning to shareholders particularly given where were trading and making sure that we drive to returns so if i turn to banamex our singular focus right now is the separation of the two banks which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter of this year this has been an enormous body of work because we are creating effectively de novo mexicos eighth largest bank weve just now gotten the core regulatory authorizations that we need to proceed with separation although there are a few other approvals pending we are in the very final stages and are working with our clients to prepare them for this switchover later on in  once the separation is complete we will turn our full attention to the ipo itself and the successful execution of the ipo is the highest priority for our head of international ernesto torres cantú to run banamex and our incoming banamex executive chairman who starts this quarter ignacio deschamps we plan to be ready to ipo at the end of based on the factors that we can control but i think as mark and i have always said the timing is going to be driven by market conditions to ensure we maximize the shareholder value and were making the necessary investments to continue growing share and i was very pleased that banamex outpaced the average market revenue growth yeartodate good expense discipline being maintained despite the citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 complex separation process and the environment so im pleased with where we are and i hope that gives you a bit of a flavor of what the path ahead looks like mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah in terms of the second part of your question a couple things so one weve been seeing good growth in our mexico consumer business weve also been investing in it appropriately so to make sure that we protect the strength of that franchise as we prepare it for separation ultimately for the ipo erika if i understood your question right if we turn to page of the deck in the bottom right hand side we show the pl for mexico consumer for and and so you can see the contribution from a revenue and expense point of view so about billion in and i think its about billion or so of tce that we have associated with this business so that gives you some sense for the contribution but it continues to perform quite well as we manage it through this process erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc perfect thank you and as a followup question im sure it is frustrating for you to see the stock reaction in a quarter where you had ppnr strength and better expectations for net interest income in the fourth quarter so maybe ill frame the question this way for you mark as we think about the gyrations in interest rate expectations globally may be remind us sort of is it fair to assume that citi is asset sensitive internationally and neutrally positioned domestically how should we think about late fees i know you told us that late fees going to for part of your initial guide for the year and additionally i think perhaps because capital markets is so strong across the board across all of your peers maybe thats not why youre getting credit for your strength this quarter so as we look into and having nir be that bigger contribution to your revenue cagr maybe walk us through what are the other sort of core fee strengths that we should look for other than ficc and banking remaining strong and coming back that could bring bringing to that path to mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc okay theres a lot there but thank you thank you for the question i would like to see the stock reacting much more favorably because this really has been a strong quarter for us and in fact as you mentioned nii when you look through it weve in fact taken our nii guidance up just a tad bit as we referenced that the full year would be slightly down versus modestly down with the fourth quarter thats flat to the third quarter and so that is an important takeaway i mentioned the headwinds and tailwinds earlier and we shouldnt lose sight of those we will get lift from reinvesting the securities as those mature we will continue to see volume growth and those are important drivers of tailwind activity for us you rightfully mentioned our interest rate exposure analysis that we do on a quarterly basis that reflects the asset sensitivity of our business and last quarter it was about billion or so of a negative assuming basis point decline across the curve assuming a static balance sheet and crosscurrencies and as you look at that asset sensitivity again you rightfully pointed out that we skew nonus in terms of the magnitude of that decline in nii should we see that parallel shift citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 and in fact its as much as billion or so of that billion is nonus dollar related across currencies and so youd have to see all of that move in tandem for that drag and the us dollar drag is about million assuming basis point shift and thats been coming down if you look back over the quarters weve been thoughtfully managing that down and thats down to about million number i would expect when we print the third quarter q it will be down a bit more and so again we are asset sensitive but it does skew outside of the us and thank you for asking the question because i think its important to remind our investors and analysts of that dynamic which in many ways may be different from that of other institutions in terms of the late fees we did say that we were including late fees in our assumptions in our outlook that weve given ill state the obvious erika which is that we want people to obviously pay on time and we do everything that we can to assist and ensure that they do that with that said we dont have a definitive timeline on late fees nor are we overly reliant on late fees to drive revenue for our firm and so it looks like that decisioning will likely kind of fall closer to sometime in and so there is a small adjustment in the last quarter of our revenue forecast but its inside of the guidance that we gave and doesnt materially change that in any way and then the last part of your question i think was around nir and the fee revenue and as i mentioned earlier im not going to give guidance for but i think your question was around where are we likely to see continued momentum as it relates to fee revenue growth and i would start with services where fees were up some yearoveryear and yes we should adjust for the argentine peso devaluation but even if you adjust for that its doubledigit yearoveryear noninterest revenue growth and when you look at those drivers theyve been consistently strong crossborder transaction value up us dollar clearing volume up commercial card spend up in the supplement youll see that its mid to high single digit yeartodate growth across those kpis as well we expect that that will continue with our corporate clients and as we bring on new commercial clients as well ill turn you to if you look at banking we talked about already so i wont kind of lean into that too much but except to highlight a really strong quarter in banking in investment banking fees in particular the rebound that weve been talking about but importantly us capturing share in that rebound and these important partnerships that position us well as sponsors start to lean back into the market the investments that weve been making in talent in sectors we need to strengthen all of those things are going to play to continued fee momentum as we go into wealth again really strong performance this quarter with revenues up but look at the client investment assets up the client balances up thats driving fee momentum and its a keen area of focus for andy and that team that hes pulled together and its a real opportunity for us given the trillion or so of assets that our clients hold away from us and were better positioning ourselves to capture that and then finally you can see kind of continued momentum on uspb but its across the board is what im saying erika in terms of that fee momentum and it is important its an important aspect as we think about getting to those medium term targets and that to revenue operator our next question will come from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi mark hi jane citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mark you touched on in your prepared comments about growing the us personal banking rotce to higher levels and you mentioned two items one innovative products and the normalization of credit costs can you elaborate on those two items that will be contributing to the driver aside from the efficiency improvement that you also touched on mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure so obviously uspb is a combination of the cards businesses that we have in the retail banking business and that cards portfolio has both branded as well as retail services as part of it and even within branded we have proprietary cards where we frankly have been looking to how we can come up with new innovative products one example of product innovation is the recent refresh that we did of our strata premier card which was designed to drive acquisition and engagement with a new rewards offering and with that acquisitions are up some both quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear for branded cards so thats an example of product innovation another one is we also launched flex pay at costco a few quarters ago and you can see good instalment loan growth as a consequence of that up some or so and so that type of product creation is important to acquisitions its important to ensuring the card stays top of wallet and important to driving some of that top line performance and then the other thing that i mentioned youre right was around cost of credit and that really is the continued normalization of cost of credit i mentioned a couple of times now the idea that multiple vintages are maturing at the same time and that has to play through for us to kind of see a more normal level of credit and that will be important to the returns and again we are starting to see stabilization in both the cost of credit line but also in delinquencies and thats a good indicator for us gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just following up on credit in the banking division you guys mentioned the cost of credit was i think million due to acl build of million and it was due to a mix a change in the mix in the portfolio can you share with us what that mix change was that drove this provision mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc its a mix of kind of different asset classes and clients that weve lent against theres nothing material or significant in that number when you look at the nonaccrual loans that ratio still basis points so its a mix change of our exposures but nothing material there jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and we continue to see a very healthy corporate sector really across the world citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 operator our next question will come from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is now open please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi two questions jane and mark one is on expenses and the other is on your response to the asset cap question before so first one expenses an easier one earlier in the year you had said you expect about million to billion of severance charges in the billion to billion did you have any in the third quarter expect any if the fourth and do you expect to be done with those this year or any to continue into next year too mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so that number was a combination of restructuring charges and severance charges or repositioning charges and we breakout obviously restructuring so that you can see those and this restructuring component was largely driven by the org simplification that will be done this year the normal severance or repositioning charges that we take as a normal course of bau you would expect that to occur in any year and it certainly will be part of and going forward we did have some this quarter i would expect that we will have some next quarter but i dont see us being outside of by any stretch the range that i gave and again the range was for the combination of both vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks on that and shifting to the asset cap question jane and mark we didnt hear a clear answer on a do you have an asset cap and b even if you dont what is the effective implication or impact of what the regulators have said jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so let me be crystal clear we do not have an asset cap and there are no additional measures other than what was announced in july in place and not expecting any so the implications of what were doing is as ive laid out weve increased investments in the areas where we were behind particularly in the data related to our regulatory processes and regulatory reporting were increasing investment behind it and we continue to make progress material progress on the orders in place including closing the bsaaml order this quarter the third order closed since vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and you dont expect anything meaningful jane that will impact business like there was this news story about ph the china sub license that you didnt get approved by the regulator anything more meaningful like that that might be occurring that may be jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc absolutely let me be crystal clear absolutely nothing citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thank you operator our next question will come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi just a couple of clarification questions i guess first on banamex are you on track to still ipo it the fourth quarter of next year or does it just get pushed out by a quarter with the legal separation taking a little bit longer jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc look i think as i mentioned in response to erikas question we plan to be ready to ipo at the end of based on the factors we can control the timing is going to get driven by how we maximize shareholder value and that will be market conditions so thats where we stand matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay i think that means that by the end of you talk about that was kind of my clarification question on that i thought you needed four quarters after you legally separated it to officially ipo it jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc we believe as we stand at the moment we would be ready to ipo at the end of its much more a focus on what the market conditions at that point will be and mark and i are very very much focused on the shareholder value and maximizing that over rushing over one quarter versus another quarter mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc and theres no hard rule on sorry go ahead jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes there isnt a hard rule on you have to have got four quarters after you have separated matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i see okay thats super helpful we just havent had that many of these so thats helpful and then just separately i think in the prepared remarks you guys mentioned a modest provision within services for some of the unremitted corporate dividends and i just wanted to clarify that and what country is that and i guess i thought there wasnt really much liability to you guys from that so any clarification on that i know it was a small amount but that would be helpful thank you citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure its a small amount in the back of the deck we have a page on russia exposure its related to that matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay but still feel like theres not risk to you guys from all those kind of trapped dividends i guess why take a small reserve if theres legally no risk to you guys mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc well its the way we treat the exposure there were following the guidelines on how we need to treat exposures in the country that we arent able to distribute to clients but we actually have to hold on their behalf and so we have to book a reserve associated with that and so we do that we obviously show on the page what the exposure is in the event of a loss of control and you can kind of see how that ultimately nets out but were following the appropriate guidelines for whats required to for reserves of that nature matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it okay thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah operator our next question comes from the line of ryan kenny with morgan stanley your line is now open please go ahead ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey thanks for taking my question i have one for mark so you mentioned that services nii is a tailwind as rates decline can you just unpack how that happens is there any benefit from swap rolloff or a floating swap that we should be thinking about thats embedded in that statement mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc there are a couple of things kind of to keep in mind on the services business so one is is obviously this is a client business its not just a deposit taking business and so how we think about pricing to those client becomes really important youve got the us and nonus dynamic thats playing through where for institutional clients weve largely been holding to the higher betas that we saw as rates have ticked up again with the relationship in mind and we have some offsetting pressure outside of the us as those betas kind of catch up but i think importantly you also heard me mention the reinvestment into securities at higher yields and that reinvestment or those higher yields ultimately play out through the businesses and so that will show up as part of kind of nii as we think about services but the other businesses as well and so those are important components of the nii story for services citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 i think when you look at the inquarter performance and nii is down a big part of that is driven by the argentina rates movement in the quarter versus last year so lower rates were earning in argentina playing through that line particularly in this quarter if you adjusted for that on the nii line it would be flat to slightly a little bit better so thats really what it is its kind of management of client relationships as well as the higher earnings on reinvested securities contributing to that as well as volume from operating account growth that we expect ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah operator our next question comes from the line of saul martinez with hsbc your line is now open please go ahead saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hey guys couple quick questions first just a followup on banamex jane as you know there are concerns about judicial reform in mexico and the implications for rule of law in mexican asset prices have suffered as a result i think the largest mexican bank trades at something in the neighborhood of seven times earnings if market conditions dont improve and mexican asset prices remain depressed and these concerns persist then what i mean do you just wait until market conditions improve or how do you think about this process in the context of what used to be a deteriorating macro backdrop for mexico jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah weve got to wait and see what the market conditions will be but the north star for me and for mark is crystal clear it is optimizing and maximizing our shareholder value so if the conditions are not appropriate at that time then we will wait until they are in the meantime the business is performing well its accretive to our returns its not a drag here in any shape or form so there is no need to rush for a suboptimal result here but we will ipo and we will exit banamex but we wont do that in a reckless manner we will be disciplined about it as you would expect us to be and as i think were demonstrating that we are on multiple different dimensions saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay fair enough and then i guess a followup on the us personal banking rotce improvement and the normalization of the cost of credit seems to be a big component of that but mark can you just remind us where you are in terms of cost of credit versus what you would think a more normalized level is for branded cards and retail services i guess how much of a tailwind does a more normalized credit environment entail in terms of credit cost mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 again i dont want to get into at this stage i assure you we will give more color and commentary on that as we get into the fourth quarter earnings in january what i will say again as you think about these businesses we do see continued top line we do expect continued top line momentum weve had eight consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage in uspb this quarter so were managing the expense base well we think theres more upside to the top line were very focused on growth across the portfolios and i do think that cost of credit again if for no other reason but the compounding effect of those vintages maturing as well as kind of inflation starting to come off rates trickling down that should be better for the consumer and should start to play out in both the macroeconomic scenarios that we run for cecl purposes but also ultimately in delinquencies and ncls and were starting to see that improvement in delinquencies and its stabilization already somewhat so i dont want to get into guidance but thats kind of how i think about the drivers or contributors to improve returns over the medium term operator our next question will come from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo your line is now open please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thanks for the clarification on the asset cap question that i asked earlier and i know you are limited in how much you can say about regulators but just be clear because a lot of email traffic going back you did say there is no asset cap and you dont expect one and you dont expect other additional actions at this time jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc correct mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you for clarifying that and i guess look i have great respect im an exregulator paul volcker was my hero i respect regulators and nobody wants to see you cut corners to get to your billion to billion of expenses but im just wondering and you have consolidated systems apps layers bureaucracy and youre divesting lots of activity so its just even the amended consent order was surprising because you have taken so many efforts and if you should have had an amended consent order or other actions they probably should have been in place one five or literally years ago and so thats just confusing on the outside so with that said is this a matter of spending more money or about doing these tasks more intelligently in other words you put more gas in the tank the cars not going faster so is it amount of resources or just being more intelligent in terms of resolving some of these regulatory issues jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so let me break it down to a couple of pieces so i start off just remind everyone the consent orders are very very broad and the action that was taken was because were behind in a narrower area which is the data particularly regarding our regulatory reporting where were behind is the main area of focus we moved swiftly to address it were very transparent about it from early on in the year that we were falling behind on this and overall im pleased with our progress and as you say mike i listed a number of areas of progress and trying to make it as tangible as we can given what we can and cant say as this is supervisory im pleased that our businesses continue to improve their performance while the transformation is going on theyre the two priorities we have this year so i think effectively yes we can walk and chew gum at the same time and the huge benefit of all of the citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 simplification on the business on the organization the other efforts is making it easier for us to execute and be very focused and well maybe mark i pass it over to you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i think your questions helpful in the sense that you said is it kind of a rethink on our approach or is it the need to spend more money and one of the things that weve done mike is take a step back and look at how weve been approaching data for example so this is and we are going to make we have made some changes to our approach and those changes relate to how we get after resolving data issues that are identified ensuring that theres engagement from the front end business from the functions that are most relevant and that theres consideration for whats required on reg reporting in order for us to get that process streamlined and correct and so there are aspects of this that require a change in our approach and weve been taking that change making that change rather and well make more changes accordingly as weve taken that step back and there are aspects of it that require at a minimum review of what is causing either the delay or us not moving at the pace that we would like to move or that our regulators would like and that is in fact what the resource review plan was that was in the amended consent order it was basically a statement saying that you need to ensure that you have sufficient resources and that theyre allocated towards achieving the timely and sustainable compliance and so part of our process is in fact that taking a regular review of what is on track in the way of our milestones and deliverables where we see things that are being delayed or going red what is the underlying root cause for why is it a resource issue where we need to put more dollars and people or technology to it is it a process issue where we need to reconsider our approach and on the other side of that root cause taking action to fix it and so your question is spoton the answer is that in many instances it will be a little bit of both but importantly our processes include that type of analysis and assessment so that we can get after the execution on this in an effective way i hope that helps jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and all of this drives productivity and other benefits for our shareholders as well as making sure that were strengthening citi from the regulatory perspective mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last followup to the extent that you see a disconnect between your performance and the stock price that would seem to create more of an opportunity to buy the stock at when tangible book value is and so i hope that ive used this analogy before but hopefully youre selling the chairs and the desk and the silverware in the executive dining room to go ahead and buy back stock whenever you can jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc its clearly given where we are trading were very focused around the opportunities to buy back stock and mindful of the importance of it and equally yes we are proud of the performance of the franchise this quarter it was a citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 very strong quarter and important set of proof points for our investors we are on a deliberate path were making the progress that we need to and actually pretty excited about the path ahead of us and the potential that we see operator there are no further questions ill now turn the call over to jenn landis for closing remarks jennifer landis headinvestor relations citigroup inc thank you everyone for
