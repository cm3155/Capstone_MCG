relations citigroup inc thank you operator good morning and thank you all for joining us id like to remind you that todays presentation which is available for download on our website citigroupcom may contain forwardlooking statements which are based on managements current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our sec filings with that ill turn it over to jane jane nind fraser chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you jen and hello to everyone joining us today well is shaping up to be another interesting year given the tumultuous events of the last few weeks im going to share some observations and then well turn to what was a good quarter first our banking system as a whole is very strong while a small handful of institutions still have challenges to overcome the us financial system remains unmatched globally and i feel confident saying that as someone who has worked in many different systems around the world the us system comprises a healthy mix of community banks regional banks and larger global banks including citi we all have important but different roles to play serving different clients with different needs and on different scales i would also point to the rapid response by state federal and international regulators that help reinforce confidence in the system at a very critical juncture im pleased that citi has been a source of stability for the financial system and a source of strength for our clients thats not an accident we are in a position to play this role because our strategy is delivering a simpler more focused bank we benefit from a diversified earnings base and resilient business model this is reinforced by our robust balance sheet management liquidity position and strong risk management framework were disciplined in how we run the firm from client selection to capital planning and its also thanks to our people and i want to express my pride in our colleagues around the world who worked tirelessly last month to serve clients as they turned to citi as a port in the storm recent events have shown that prudent asset and liability management is absolutely paramount while mark is going to walk you through our approach and our focus on interest rate risk liquidity and capital i do want to mention a few things myself in terms of assets our loans are highquality and short duration we have highly liquid investment securities and a significant amount of cash we have over trillion worth of available liquidity resources including billion of hqla and an lcr of and we maintain a diverse set of funding citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 sources including over trillion of deposits across corporates consumers industries and regions many of which are operational in nature indeed the cornerstone is our institutional deposit base which comprises about of our deposits most of these deposits are particularly sticky because they sit in operating accounts that are fully integrated into how our multinational clients run their businesses around the world from their payrolls to their supply chains to their cash and liquidity management of these deposits are with clients who use all three of our integrated services payments and collections liquidity management and working capital solutions the data that we aggregate from these deposits and their related flows is fundamental to how our clients manage their efficiency risk and compliance and this greatly increases our deposit stickiness its also why nearly of these deposits are from client relationships that are years old or more finally we operate a strong risk framework that looks at both assets and liability concentrations across client segment industry and region and were confident in the size and nature of our exposures given our very rigorous stress testing we also diligently manage counterparty risk which is critical given the interconnectedness of financial institutions we are in a strong position to navigate whatever environment we face which is particularly relevant given the degree of uncertainty today the fed continues to use rate policy to battle inflation which has been more than stubborn in services even as we see signs of cooling in labor and manufacturing we expect the recent events to be disinflationary and credit to contract we believe its now more likely that the us will enter into a shallow recession later this year that could be exacerbated in depth and duration in a more severe credit crunch but right now the biggest unknown is the impact on terminal shortterm us interest rates and of course how the debt ceiling plays out in europe the ecb is on a similar but more difficult quest to tame inflation they have had some help from lower thanexpected energy prices and the outlook continues to be a bit brighter however the war in ukraine sadly shows no sign of ending and europe faces more structural challenges such as the need for increased defense spending higher energy costs and fiscal burdens that will make efforts to dampen inflation and stimulate growth more difficult in asia the reopening of china is adding to the momentum in the region although the chinese consumer has been slower to rebound than expected i saw many green shoots firsthand talking to our clients and our bankers in my various trips to india japan and hong kong this year we have to keep a close eye on geopolitics as the uschina relationship becomes increasingly strained and is fragmenting economic blocs and we see this translate into shift in flows and heightened crossborder volume across tts and our global network now turning to how we performed this quarter we reported net income of billion and an eps of we had good revenue growth of exdivestitures and both revenue and expenses were in line with our guidance our rotce of nearly benefited from the closing of the sales of our consumer businesses in india and vietnam and would have been over without those gains let me highlight our operating performance in each of our five core businesses in services tts just continued to go from strengthtostrength with revenues up noninterest revenue was up quarteronquarter on the back of increased crossborder activity and good performance in commercial cards due to the rebound of corporate travel security services wasnt too shabby either up as we executed on new mandates onboarded new auc and benefited from higher rates within markets our fixed income revenues were up from a year ago we benefited from excellent performance in rates and continued engagement from our corporate clients the first quarter of was no slouch as you may recall but this quarter was our thirdbest in a decade equities was citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 much weaker however down markedly in both derivatives and cash although still had revenues north of billion banking was down again but there were signs of a beginning of a pickup including increased activity in the investmentgrade market in us personal banking our cards business gained momentum as all drivers continued to normalize to pre covid levels and beyond branded cards and retail services saw revenues up and retail banking saw some growth as we continued to see good momentum in mortgages and installment lending and also experienced a significant increase in digital deposits we did see a notable softening in consumer spending growth over the course of the quarter travel and entertainment continued to grow in march but essentials were flat and almost all other same categories were down savings rates are below historic averages and while the upper quintiles of household income still have roughly a trillion in excess savings the savings of the lower quintiles have been significantly drawn down so were keeping a diligent eye on the lower fico bands of economic growth and services spend slow finally while revenues were down again we remain confident about the prospects of our wealth business despite the challenging headwinds growth in citigold accounts client acquisition and client advisors were all solid and we expect these drivers to flow through to revenues later this year and beyond we also saw the early signs of a longawaited asian recovery we built credit reserve this quarter on the back of growth in revolving balances in cards and poorer macro outlook ncls continued to normalize in consumer while the health of our corporate base was evident in another quarter of very low ncls finally we continue to generate capital through our earnings with our cet1 ratio now at we have room to absorb the temporary upfront impact should we sign a deal for mexico as you know we continue to pursue a dual path here and we are committed to increasing the amount of capital we return to our shareholders over time as you can see from slide in addition to good operating performance from our businesses and despite everything else going on in the industry we got a lot done this quarter as we implement the strategy we shared with you at investor day we closed the sales of our consumer businesses in india and vietnam indonesia and taiwan are next on the list to close later in the year our asian consumer sales will then be complete and we are intensifying our efforts to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our organizational structure we made some significant leadership announcements im delighted that andy sieg will join citi at my table as the new head of wealth management andy is a widelyrespected leader in this space and comes to us after running an billion business with trillion in client balances he is the latest and the most visible example of the excellent talent we have attracted over the last couple of years with karen peetz retiring we named anand selva as our chief operating officer and asked him to take on running our enterprisewide transformation program in addition to his current responsibilities anand has been at citi for over three decades and has a strong track record of delivering results in terms of our transformation were completely focused on executing our plan to address the consent orders and improve our risk and control environment mark will walk you through specific examples of how were modernizing our infrastructure simplifying processes and improving data quality importantly these efforts are improving the client experience and helping us deliver citis full capabilities to them to wrapup its one year after our investor day and im proud of the progress weve made and our relentless focus on delivering our strategy is clear our business model is resilient and diversified our balance sheet is strong were making good progress on execution amidst considerable turmoil were delivering on our guidance and our commitment our team is determined to continue delivering with excellence citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 and with that i would like to turn it over to mark and then we will be delighted as always to take your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks jane and good morning everyone im going to start with the firmwide financial results focusing on year overyear comparisons for the first quarter unless i indicate otherwise and spend a little more time on expenses our balance sheet and capital then i will turn to the results of each segment on slide we show financial results for the full firm in the first quarter we reported net income of approximately billion and an eps of and an rotce of nearly on billion of revenues embedded in these results are pretax divestiturerelated impacts of approximately million largely driven by the gain on sale of the india consumer business excluding these items eps was with an rotce of over in the quarter total revenues increased by on a reported basis and increased excluding divestiture related impacts as strength across services fixed income and us personal banking was partially offset by declines in investment banking equity market and wealth as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exit and winddown our results include expenses of billion an increase of versus the prior year excluding divestiturerelated costs in the prior year expenses increased largely driven by the transformation other risk and control investments and inflation partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reductions from the exits and winddowns cost of credit was approximately billion primarily driven by the continued normalization in card net credit losses and acl and other provision builds of approximately million largely related to a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and growth in card revolving balance at the end of the quarter we had nearly billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately on slide we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers transformation investments drove of the growth largely in the data finance and risk and control program and of the increase is driven by structural largely in the form of compensation and benefits including the full year impact of the people we hired last year as well as those we hired in the first quarter embedded in this structural bucket are a few key items first other risk and control investments that are enterprisewide and in the businesses which make up about of the total expense increase second the impact of additional front and backoffice hires third inflation and severance costs all of this was partially offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exits and across the firm technologyrelated expenses grew we recognize these investments have driven a significant increase in expenses but they are crucial to modernize the firm address the consent orders and position citi for success in the years to come now turning to slide id like to spend a few minutes giving you some tangible examples of what were investing in and the benefits well see over time in many cases these investments will simplify our processes and platforms for example we are retiring and consolidating cash equities platforms to one single modern platform eliminating cost over time and we have consolidated platforms to one global sanctions screening platform reducing false alerts improving the client experience and eliminating costs were also modernizing our infrastructure and the security of our data and information by enhancing cybersecurity through the use of ai and improving the security of our infrastructure and devices leading to fewer operating losses and were leveraging industryleading cloudbased solutions to modernize and streamline the connectivity between our front office systems and the general ledger eliminating manual processes and operating costs over time citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 were driving the strategy by investing in the client experience both in terms of our technology interface and innovative new products we launched our cloudbased instant payments platform for ecommerce clients in cts were also deploying citidirect commercial banking our mobile and digital interface for commercial clients so they too can open accounts and access all products and services across icg in the same way our large corporate clients do and finally were investing in data to create advanced decisionmaking client targeting and risk management capabilities which has allowed us to enhance our returns through greater rwa efficiency and we expect many of these investments to generate efficiencies that will allow us to selffund future investments over time on slide we show net interest income deposits and loans where ill speak to sequential variance in the first quarter net interest income increased by approximately million largely driven by interestearning balances in cards average loans were up slightly as growth in pbwm was largely offset by a decline in icg average deposits were also up slightly driven by growth in both pbwm and icg and our net interest margin increased basis points on slide we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics were well reserved for the current environment with nearly billion of reserves our reserves to funded loan ratio is approximately and within that us cards is in pbwm of our lending exposures are in us cards and of that exposure nearly is to customers with fico scores of or higher and ncl rates while reflecting some typical seasonality this quarter are still below precovid levels and are normalizing in line with our expectations the remaining of our pbwm lending exposure is largely in wealth and predominantly mortgages and margin lending in our icg portfolio of our total exposure approximately is investment grade of the international exposure approximately is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries and corporate nonaccrual loans remain low at about basis points of total loans as you can see on the page we break out our commercial real estate lending exposures across icg and pbwm which total billion of which is investment grade so while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain we feel very good about our asset quality exposures and reserve levels and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios on slide we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics weve added a few additional metrics to the page to provide additional transparency into how we manage the balance sheet we maintain a very strong trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a welldiversified trillion deposit base across regions industries customers and account types which is deployed into highquality diversified assets our balance sheet is a reflection of our strategy and welldiversified business model we leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates financial institutions investors and individuals with global needs first the majority of our deposits billion are institutional and span countries and the majority of these institutional deposits tend to be interest ratesensitive so when rates go up we reprice the deposits accordingly but that reprice takes into account the overall client relationship as well as the level of rates but despite this interest rate sensitivity these deposits tend to be stable as they are tied to the operational services that we provide and these institutional deposits are complemented by billion of us retail consumer and global wealth deposits as you can see on the bottom right side of the page these deposits are well diversified across the private bank citigold retail and wealth at work as well as across regions and products with of us citigold clients and approximately of ultrahighnet worth clients having been with citi for more than years our wealth deposits tend to also be interest ratesensitive but this usually results in our customers moving to higheryielding deposits and investment products citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 now turning to the asset side at a high level you can think of our deposits being largely deployed in three asset buckets loans investment securities and cash which complement the interest rate sensitivity and liquidity value of our liability and this deployment is also linked to our strategy we use our resources to lend and transact with our clients in ways that deepen the relationship and drive returns for our shareholders while maintaining strong liquidity and capital our billion loan portfolio is welldiversified across consumer and corporate loans and the duration of the total portfolio is approximately years as the majority of these loans are variable rate about of our balance sheet is in cash and investment securities which contribute to our trillion of available liquidity resources and at the end of the quarter we had an lcr of which means we have roughly billion of hqla in excess of the amount required by the rule to cover stressed outflows and you can see the details of this on page in the appendix but just as important as the quantum of liquidity is the composition and duration of that liquidity and our billion investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid us treasury agency and other sovereign bonds and is split evenly between availableforsale and heldtomaturity where weve maintained a short duration of less than three years so we could benefit from higher interest rates and we actively and prudently manage our assets and liabilities by considering a range of possible stress scenarios and how they might impact interest rate risk liquidity and capital so in summary our assets and liabilities are aligned across interest rate sensitivity liquidity value and duration and reflect the diversified business model and execution of our strategy on slide we show a sequential cet1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter walking from the end of the fourth quarter first we generated billion of net income to common which added basis points second we returned billion in the form of common dividends which drove a reduction of about basis points third impact on aoci through our afs investment portfolio drove a basis point increase and finally the remaining basis point increase was largely driven by the rwa benefit from closing our consumer exits we ended the quarter with a cet1 capital ratio approximately basis points higher than last quarter and this includes basis point internal management buffer and as it relates to buybacks we did not buy back any stock this quarter and we will continue to make that decision on a quarterbyquarter basis on slide we show the results for our institutional clients group for the first quarter revenues were up this quarter largely driven by services and fixed income mostly offset by investment banking and equities expenses increased driven by transformation other risk and control investments and volumerelated expenses partially offset by fx translation and productivity savings cost of credit was a million benefit as an acl release more than offset net credit losses this resulted in net income of approximately billion up driven by the lower cost of credit and higher revenues partially offset by higher expenses icg delivered a rotce for the quarter and average loans were down reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns average deposits were up as we continue to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones and sequentially average deposits were up and on an endofperiod basis icg deposits were down sequentially driven by seasonality as our clients tend to make tax payments in the first quarter on slide we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at investor day in treasury and trade solutions revenues were up driven by growth in net interest income and in nir with growth across all client segments we continue to see healthy underlying drivers in tts that indicate consistently strong client activity with us dollar clearing volumes up reflecting continued swift share gains crossborder flows up outpacing global gdp growth and commercial card volumes up roughly led by citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 spend in travel so while the rate environment drove about of the growth this quarter business actions drove the remaining as we continued to deepen relationships with existing clients and win new clients in fact client wins are up approximately across all segments these include marquee transactions where we are serving as the clients primary operating bank in security services revenues grew as net interest income grew driven by higher interest rates across currency partially offset by a increase in noninterest revenue due to the impact of market valuations we are pleased with the execution in security services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration from significant client wins and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals as a reminder the services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higherreturning businesses with strong linkages across the firm markets revenues were down as growth in fixed income was more than offset by equities fixed income revenues were up relative to a very strong quarter last year as strength in our rates franchise was partially offset by a decline in fx and commodities equities revenues were down also relative to a strong quarter last year primarily reflecting reduced client activity in cash and equity derivatives corporate client flows remain strong and stable and we continue to make solid progress on our revenuetorwa target and finally banking revenues excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were down driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity having said that we do see revenue growth sequentially largely driven by the investment grade market opening up so overall while the market environment remains challenging we feel good about the progress that were making in icg now turning to slide we show the results for our personal banking and wealth management business revenues were up driven by net interest income growth of partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue driven by lower investment product revenues in wealth expenses were also up predominantly driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives cost of credit was billion driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolio and a reserve build of approximately million largely driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and growth in card revolving balance average loans increased driven by cards mortgages and installment lending average deposits decreased largely reflecting our wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform and pbwm delivered an rotce of largely driven by higher credit costs on slide we show pbwm revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics branded cards revenues were up driven by higher net interest income we continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up card spend volumes up and average loans up retail services revenues were up also driven by higher net interest income for both card portfolios we continue to see payment rates decline and that combined with the investments that weve been making contributed to growth in interestearning balances of in branded cards and in retail services retail banking revenues were up primarily driven by higher mortgage revenue and strong growth in personal installment lending partially offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business in fact consistent with the strategy we continued to leverage our retail network to drive over wealth referrals in the first quarter wealth revenues were down driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs particularly in the private bank however we did see notable improvement in revenues in asia which were up approximately on a sequential basis client advisors were up and we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client acquisitions across our wealth business with new clients in the private bank and citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 wealth at work up and respectively while the environment continues to remain challenging for wealth were seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy on slide we show results for legacy franchise revenues grew driven by a gain on sale of our consumer business in india partially offset by the winddowns and closed consumer exit expenses decreased largely driven by the absence of a goodwill impairment we had in the prior year as well as the impact of the winddowns and closed consumer exits on slide we show results for corporate other for the first quarter revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio expenses increased driven by transformation and other risk and control investments partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees before we move to qa id like to end with a few key points despite recent events and the economic uncertainty that remains our full year outlook for revenue and expenses remains unchanged we have a very strong balance sheet with a diversified set of assets and funding sources and ample capital and liquidity this positions us well to serve clients and navigate any number of scenarios were seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses and continue to execute on our strategy our financial path will not be linear but we are confident that we can achieve our mediumterm targets and finally im incredibly proud of how our firm and our employees have continued to help our clients navigate the recent environment and support the health of the overall banking system and with that jane and i would be happy to take your questions question and answer section operator at this time we will open the floor for questions operator instructions and our first question will come from glenn schorr with evercore your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thank you a simple one i appreciate the many many moving parts but your first quarter nii and revenue production was great and if you just annualize it youre handily ahead of your full year guide so im just curious on how youre thinking about maintaining the guide but running ahead of schedule mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thanks glenn and good morning appreciate the question look we did have a very solid first quarter but as jane mentioned in her prepared remarks there are a number of things that are still out there in the global macro environment that are uncertain and unclear including frankly as we contemplate the direction of rates and whats required to tame inflation let alone the uncertainty that weve seen in parts of the sector here through the quarter and so when i think about that and i think about how frankly betas have evolved and the likelihood of a recession in the back half of the year which we have built into our outlook i remain comfortable with the guidance that weve set here and as when you think about where that comes from the strength in tts the strength in security services both benefiting from the rate hikes we saw last year but also deepening relationships with new and existing clients the card momentum which is really about seeing more revolving activity as payment rates start to slow and the recovery in investment banking and wealth is not as swift as we would like and so we have to see how that plays citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 out too so when i put those things together theres certainly some puts and takes that speaks to the diversification of our business model but it leaves me in a place where im comfortable with the guidance that weve set and if that changes well certainly update you but thats where we are glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc i appreciate that maybe if i could followup on your comments in the previous ones on tts and security services i try to learn from all my mistakes i make a lot of them but in we thought housing prices couldnt go down much and then they went down a lot and all adapt the same thing in march thought deposits couldnt leave a bank so quickly but they did so like slide and people should look at this because theyre great and they show the stability of your deposit franchise but im curious if history can change at all meaning right now those are cash and operating deposits that clients keep with you and they need you and youre fully integrated but do you have client concentrations we should know about or are you thinking about any big changes that can happen in terms of client behavior relative to the past in terms of what they keep at any given bank i know its a tough one jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc glenn ill kick it off and pass it over to mark i feel very comfortable about how very welldiversified our deposit base is across different countries industries clients and currencies its extremely strong in that respect and as you say the majority of the institutional deposits are integrated into the operating accounts all around the world to enable the clients to run their daytoday operations the payroll the working capital the supplier financing et cetera and i think whats changed in the more digital world is frankly these have become even stickier because the amount of data the extent of integration into the technology platforms and systems of the clients and the value that we extract and present back to the clients from the combination of our fx trade cash et cetera flows is incredibly important in driving their efficiency their risk management and their financial performance as well so both the extent of that diversification and the increasing stickiness versus history is something that were certainly not complacent about but i think is why you see from the pages weve put into the deck as well including in the back on just the consistency of this base mark what would you add mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i think thats exactly right jane and glenn im glad you pointed out pages and which clearly lay out that diversification but also the scale and stability of those deposits over an extended period of time the only thing id add additional to that would be obviously were in an environment where theres quantitative tightening thats occurring thats going to have a broad industry impact as weve started to see already but were also in an environment where rates are increasing well see how that plays out through the balance of the year that has an impact on betas but we shouldnt mistake pricesensitivity or interest rate sensitivity with the stickiness of the deposits and so weve obviously talked about betas increasing particularly in our tts portfolio more so in the us it obviously will continue to increase outside of the us but well work the relationship that we have with those clients and the breadth of services that we bring to influence and impact pricing and more importantly because of the operating nature of them we do see them as very stable operator thank you our next question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is open citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi jane i challenged you a couple earnings calls ago about the complexity created by being in so many countries and you said tts was your crown jewel and here its up almost onethird yearoveryear so so far so good under since your investor day can you talk about for the fee growth i mean we kind of understand the nii growth but the fee growth is doubledigits also so i guess thats money in motion and i think you described this as the worlds largest wholesale global payment system whats happening to give you doubledigit top line growth there jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc oh thank you mike and a great question i think one of the numbers im almost more happy about than the stellar revenue growth was the fee growth quarteroverquarter here because obviously weve been benefiting in tts from the rates environment but weve also been benefiting from the drivers behind the franchise and the fee revenues are coming from multiple different products and different offerings that we have here and were typically looking and have consistently looked at growing our fee revenue as a percentage of the underlying growth in tts it got masked a bit when the rates environment was growing so much but the different areas there around the world are making a big difference to the strength of our earnings and the quality of our earnings in these areas mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then as it relates to rates generally what is it like over of your rate sensitivity is outside the us and so shouldnt you be benefiting more than you originally thought given some of these rate hikes and i guess mark are you just sandbagging a little bit i get the uncertainties in ph ib backlog pushed out and no i mean we want you to have a reasonable bar to jump over and im just wondering if you set the bar high enough for yourself for this year mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so again i think that there is certainly more opportunity in terms of how rates move and capturing nii as you pointed out outside of the us we articulate our interest rate exposure for a parallel shift and that mix at the end of last year was the that you mentioned for nonus as i sit here in march it probably is going to skew a little bit less nonus and a little bit more towards the us and youll see that in the q with that said i mentioned earlier theres still a bit of uncertainty in terms of how rates continue to evolve here in the us well see how betas evolve weve reached terminal betas in the us with our clients kind of at the end of last year and so well see kind of what happens in terms of pricing through the balance of betas are not quite at terminal levels outside of the us and so well see the pacing of that again in light of how the interest rate curve may be evolving and frankly in light of how weve seen the broader sector turmoil play out that could in fact play to our benefit but we are also again in an environment where theres quantitative tightening that is still at play and then the final point id make mike that often people forget is that in that nii is legacy nii and so as we continue with our winddowns our divestitures et cetera thats going to be a headwind that we will have to deal with operator thank you our next question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i know during the prepared remarks you talked a bit about andy sieg coming on board and i just wanted to understand how to think about the outlook for what youre doing with wealth not only in the us but the nonus locations and also try to understand how much capital you think you could apply to that business relative to what you have today thanks jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey there betsy so were obviously delighted that andy is joining as our new global head of wealth around my table and hes a tremendous leader with a great track record driving growth hes got deep product and digital expertise a proven people leader and well certainly be taking full advantage of his expertise and experience in the us were not shifting our strategy in wealth his mandate is consistent with the strategy we laid out at investor day we see a lot of potential of growth in asia as we fill in the coverage across the full wealth spectrum there well be scaling up in the us by building out the investment offering and crossselling into our existing and new clients across the country we see tremendous potential of growth in our private bank and the family office franchise really around the world and theres a lot of synergies to be realized as we point out in the different kpis and drivers between the other four core businesses in terms of referrals and other business that were able to generate across the franchise so the core of the strategy will not be changing with him coming on board mark what else would you add in mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc the only thing id add is that look we are i think wellpositioned for as the market recovers and it plays towards wealth when you look at kind of the client advisors as you know weve been investing in bringing on new client advisors weve been increasing the number of new clients that weve been onboarding as well weve invested in some of the investment products that we have and so i feel like we are positioning ourselves for when this turns and as it relates to your question regarding capital this in a normal cycle is a very healthy returning business and as the market turns and as we recover we would look to deploy capital appropriate with the growth and return prospects that we see in front of us its also not as much of a capitalintensive business as other businesses and so i think you got to keep both of those things in mind operator thank you our next question will come from erika najarian with ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning and i think its remarkable that your first two questions were essentially saying that your revenues are too conservative so thats very notable for ph us my first question is a followup to citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 betsy i think everybody was certainly impressed jane at the andy sieg hire and clearly he was running a much larger business than what citi has today and this is sort of a tricky question clearly youre still working through some of the transformation theres still a consent order but given your strength as a global player could citi participate in perhaps inorganic opportunities that could be out there ph as a result perhaps of the liquidity crisis that we saw that could potentially enhance your wealth management footprint more quickly jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc we see plenty of potential for organic growth potential and i think thats really where were going to be focusing erika because i look at the private bank and the family office there is so much wealth creation supplemented by our commercial banking relationships with a lot of the enterprises and the owners of those enterprises who are really generating the new industry champions in countryaftercountry and were extremely wellpositioned to capture that i dont see an inorganic play that would actually help us on it we also benefit because we dont have our own proprietary products and a salesforce pushing those proprietary products were open architecture and therefore were a very desirable partner for many of our key partners on the institutional side of the business to be able to provide very interesting value propositions investment opportunities and the like to our clients around the world and finally we can see certainly areas in interesting digital plays different partnerships areas like that that are of interest so ill never say never in the longerrun im sure if something very attractive comes up well be very interested and looking at it but its not something right now that i think makes sense given where were focused actually almost independent of the consent orders i think what were looking at doing right now is getting this organic play right and then well see from there mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i think its pretty telling that we have referrals from our jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc retail bank to the wealth space or to our wealth business and theres a lot of embedded opportunity and it really speaks to the integrated model that weve been talking about jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and i think the other bit id also just point to is i think one of the things we do benefit from is that we arent constrained by being dominated by a brokerage model in a particular way of doing wealth so part of the mandate for andy and the ones that weve been working on todate is really looking at what is modern wealth management and making sure that were really wellpositioned that way because i do think that will be more of the way of the future operator thank you our next question will come from jim mitchell with seaport global your line is open citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc maybe just a question on capital appreciate the fact that the potential sale of the mexico franchise would be a negative impact but youre sitting at a pretty comfortable cushion now above your target obviously your expected future retained earnings growth should be more than an offset so how do we think about how are you thinking about the timing of restarting buybacks with your stock as cheap as it is mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thanks jim and good morning look as you point out we grew capital pretty sizably this quarter up to from a cet1 ratio point of view and up significantly from a year ago some basis points or so and a good portion of that a significant portion of that was really net income earnings generation which is important look the way we think about it is that we certainly have wellabove whats required from a reg point of view and it includes our internal management buffer of about basis points but as weve said in the past there is certainly the mexico transaction and that would be a temporary drag if you will to cet1 at signing the difference between signing and closing if it were a sale to take place and then there are a couple of other factors that are out there as well so think about the basel iii end game thats out there and the capital requirements that could come out of that think about the ccardfast that has been submitted and currently under review and what that might mean for stress capital buffers and also think about just where we are in the broader economy and broader global macro environment that were playing in and needing to see how that kind of evolves and so when i think about all those factors were in a place where we will continue to take it quarterbyquarter but id end by saying our bias is kind of where yours is which is given where were trading all things being equal wed like to be buying back shares but we have to be responsible about that and the timing of that jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc i think well have more clarity fairly soon around a number of the factors so well be able to give you better clarity on timing before too long jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc yeah all fair and then maybe as a followup just you mentioned increased macro assumptions embedded in reserves where are you now on the macro assumptions in the reserve book mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 so in terms of the reserve again remember we have a couple of different scenarios that we run when we calculate the cecl reserves our current reserves are based on those three macroeconomic scenarios it reflects a or so unemployment rate on a weighted basis over eight quarters so thats relatively flat versus last quarter the other point worth mentioning is that in this particular calculation for the quarter we did skew a little bit more towards the downside in terms of the probability weighting than last quarter again in light of the macro environment and the combination of that as well as some normalization in the portfolio including an increase in revolver activity contributed to the increase in reserves we saw but to answer your question unemployment at about for the weighted im sorry for the weighted basis over the eight quarters jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay operator thank you our next question will come from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i wanted to start off with a question just on the ib and trading outlook on the trading side just given some of the recent macro shocks have you seen any evidence of bad volatility and are you still confident that you can sustain that midsingledigit growth target and just on the investment banking side i wanted to see if theres any evidence of green shoots its been a challenging backdrop as you noted mark but i was hoping you could offer some color just across some of the different product lines across ma ecm dcm mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc why dont i start and then jane feel free to jump in look we had a we saw better performance in the quarter in markets than when i talked at the conference earlier in the quarter and really that played through in our fixed income business which was up about yearoveryear driven largely by strength in rates and we saw rate volatility in the back end of the quarter and we were wellpositioned to take advantage of that and serve clients and that aided getting us to the down in aggregate across markets what we talked about for the full year is kind of relatively flat performance and i still think that based on what we see today and subject to how the macro continues to evolve that well be able to deliver on that but as you know volatility in many instances plays to the favor of markets businesses and so theres a bit of an unknown as to how that evolves but i feel confident in the guidance that weve given thus far on that did you want to citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah id jump in before you turn to banking as well i think one of the differences with our franchise compared to some others is that we are the goto bank for corporates and that provides a highly attractive but pretty steady flow of activity this is obviously in the volatile markets weve been seeing is from our perspective very good volatility because were able to support our clients in rates fx commodity hedging and it makes our risk flows much more diversified than our competitors particularly in volatile markets like this were not taking positions this is really attractive client flow business right at the heart of the global network the other piece that i think is important in the mix here too is just the partnership with tts crossborder payments these are the elements and cornerstone of the fx franchise so theres some pieces here of the volatility that one doesnt usually think of this as being so clientheavy but thats whats differentiating on the citi franchise mark back to you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc no thank you i think thats exactly right in terms of the corporate client base there look in investment banking obviously the wallets down were down meaningfully last year we saw some performance good performance in debt capital markets this quarter up versus the prior quarter particularly as we saw activity in the investment grade names which is an area of strength for us for sure and i think there was a bit of momentum behind a bit more clarity on the direction of rates and so well see how that continues to evolve and play out the other thing id add is that we continue to have very good dialogue with clients as they manage through the environment and try to anticipate what the balance of the year looks like and at some point its clear that clients are going to need to get back into the markets but that trajectory is going to largely depend on the geopolitical and macro environment and how we all manage and navigate that uncertainty so very engaged healthy pipeline but subject to how the environment continues to evolve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great and for my followup just on pbwm fee income trends im not going to ask you about the broader wealth strategy but were big fans of andy here so congrats on the hire the one thing i did want to get a better sense of is how much of the sequential improvement that we saw in fees is a function of just partner payments being higher as credit continues to normalize and how we should be thinking about the trajectory in fees within pbwm over the remainder of this year mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i think there are a couple of things to kind of keep in mind in terms of pbwm fees and i think part of it is that if pbwm is a combination of both the cards business as well as the wealth business and a good amount of the pressure that weve seen in fees and that is still subject to how the environment evolves is in the wealth space because we continue to see fee pressure on investment activity and revenues there and well have to see how the market valuations move on some of the assets that we manage on behalf of clients and what momentum it drives in terms of more investment activity so i think thats a big part of the drag in fees the upside that weve seen in fees in banking and cards again i think will be subject to how activity and volume evolves across our cards business we do expect revolving levels to continue but purchase sales while theyre up yearoveryear when we look at kind of the latter months of the quarter theyve been under the growth has been slowing and has been quite citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 concentrated in travel and entertainment so well have to see how some of that volume activity evolves and thatll be a factor to keep in mind operator thank you our next question will come from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon just a couple of quick questions one in terms of the banamex sale i think jane you mentioned that maybe we might hear something relatively soon and you still are pursuing the dual track process one if you do decide to go the ipo route does that change the accounting dynamics mark with regards to taking that hit early on if given just the time it might take to go through an ipo and the outlook for the mexican economy the banks continues to be robust is that impacting or influencing how youre thinking about the value that you should get from this transaction jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so were in a very active dialogue right now in mexico so neither mark or i are going to comment in a lot of detail there as you say were continuing to pursue a dual path both a sale and an ipo so well have an exit strategy either way and well take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders so weve got an enormous body of work going on in mexico to separate out the institutional business im pleased with the progress theyre making i think were seeing when we look at the performance of our mexican franchise a lot of the really strong performance is happening in our icg business where mexico is such a beneficiary of the supply chain dynamics that are happening around the world and its location is obviously very beneficial given the proximity to the us as well so i think a lot of the dynamic and the big benefits here coming are in the institutional franchise that were keeping within citi as a core part of our business so the current mexican economy doesnt really have so much of an impact on our current decisionmaking the principle is we will take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah and just to put some numbers to that for the quarter mexico was up revenue yearoveryear quarter overquarter up cards growth deposit growth so performing well i would say and in terms of the latter part of your question janes exactly right everything were doing is positioning us for both a private sale andor an ipo and well choose the path thats best for shareholders an ipo would take longer it would likely take longer as we would want a set of full audited financials et cetera i would say that in terms of what the implications would be from an accounting point of view cta accounting is different for an ipo so we would not recognize that cta through the pl in an ipo we wouldnt have at signing that impact that is different from that closing and so that would not be an issue the impact would be a matter of how much we ipod at that time so a lot of moving pieces there we would need to figure out if we ended up down that path but hopefully that gives you some sense of the scenarios there but id end with just one final point that jane has made already which is that the outcome that we choose will be the best outcome for our shareholders our clients and employees citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and that will be an exit operator thank you our next question will come from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hello you guys have talked about bending the curve on costs i think in the latter part of and i wanted to see if thats still the case and i guess maybe just some clarification on what bending the curve means is that slowing expense growth absolute drop any kind of clarity on that and costs in general kind of mediumterm would be helpful thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thank matt to answer your question very directly yes it is still the case we are going to bend the curve as i mentioned towards the end of it does mean an absolute dollar reduction in expenses matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then i think in the past youve kind of insinuated thats like the start of hopefully a more material drop in costs beyond obviously this is far away but just any additional color there too thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look again look the expense base is a key area of focus for us right we recognize that expenses have been growing theyve been growing because weve been investing in the franchise both transformationwise as well as businessled growth to support the competitive advantages that we have in many of our franchises but were managing that very actively and very deliberately and that means that were looking to ensure that were spending the money in the right way in the right places and that were going to yield the benefits that we expect from that over time and that was all factored in to the targets that we set at our investor day for the medium term and what that requires is that we start bending the curve in as i stated and that we end in that mediumterm at a place where we have an operating efficiency of about and were positioned to have returns that are in that to rotce point of view there are a couple of factors that are going to contribute to lowering that expense base one the divestitures that weve been talking about right the second is the benefits from the transformation and other investments that ive just referenced and the third is further organizational and management simplification efforts that we have underway that are enabled by the idea that were exiting consumer countries and so those three factors if you will become very important to ensure that we get to that lower cost structure and that were able to deliver on the broader commitments that were making with regards to returns operator thank you our next question will come from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets your line is open citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi jane hi mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc a couple questions jane maybe starting with you first or mark both of you can answer it in view of what the disruptions weve seen in the banking system in the month of march with what went on with the regional banks here in the us and obviously the large investment bank over in switzerland do you guys see changes coming or what changes do you see coming in terms of regulatory whether its more capital more liquidity and it may not be directed at a company like yours because youre a global sifi already and it might be more regional orientated in the united states and as part of this question jane can you guys give us some color on the deposit you and your peers made into first republic what was the thinking behind that as well jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc sure thank you for the question gerard well id say that we hope that there will be a thoughtful and a targeted approach to any changes in the regulatory and capital framework and that they address the root causes of what actually happened here and what happened is a combination of macro impacts from the sharp rapid rate increases and some idiosyncratic situations namely a lack of proper asset and liability management at a small handful of banks we dont see these issues as pervasive throughout the broader banking industry but the events certainly highlight the importance of prudent asset and liability management we still believe that there is plenty of capital amongst the large banks and if capital requirements were to increase for the large banks by their regulators it would exacerbate any credit tightening that might go on and related to that what continues to keep me most awake at night is the quantity and quality of activity in the shadow banking industry it does not benefit from the same regulatory frameworks and protections for participants and i amongst others fear that more activity getting driven into it if the banking capital requirements increase will be to the detriment of system strength and stability so we hope that this approach will be thoughtful and targeted to where the issues actually were as i said in my opening comments we thought that the regulators both at the local and national and the international level were very were swift and effective in making sure that they tackled the issues that were in front and we were absolutely delighted that the large banks acted as a source of strength and lets just step back for a minute in the face of tremendous market uncertainty of the largest us banks were able to come together to inject billion of deposits into first republic in a little over one day and that speaks volumes for our capital and balance sheet positions and i think the responsibility of large institutions and recognizing that we also play an important role here in helping stabilize situations like this we thought it was very citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 important to help buy some time and also demonstrate our confidence in the overall us banking system so i hope that gives you a bit of a flavor gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no very very insightful very good thank you and then as a followup question i noticed in your card i think it was slide that you give us the prime of the portfolio is prime which is fico scores greater than i dont know if you would agree with this statement but were hearing that there were some fico score inflation as a result of the pandemic a lot of consumers saw their fico scores go up and ive seen numbers as high as points that may be on the high side but can you guys do you agree with that and if you do would you then expect the fico score customer at some point to behave like a score customer jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc i think the short answer is no but let me let mark answer that one mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i think whats really important here gerard is kind of what were seeing in the way of the performance of the portfolio so again ive heard that sentiment regarding fico score inflation we feel very confident in how weve assessed our customers and what it means to have of our customers prime and greater than i think importantly what were seeing is were seeing payment rates start to slow were seeing average interestearning balances start to increase were seeing ncl rates increase but particularly driven by the lower fico score customers across the portfolio which is where you would expect to start to see that drag occur and the ncl rates that were seeing are still well below what we would see in a normal cycle right and theyre in line with what weve been forecasting for performance so there are no surprises that were seeing in terms of how that curve is evolving wed expect that it will get back to those normal levels towards the beginning of next year it will likely play through those normal levels a bit before tapering but my point here is that we understand our customers the portfolio and how it reacts to the environment enough to forecast that out and so far thats been performing in line with that forecast and those estimates and importantly we continue to stress it to make sure were not missing anything and importantly we carry a significant a sizable reserve as you know as part of that billion jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc id also add that we dont just rely on fico scores for assessing the credit of our customers and our portfolio theres a tremendous amount of data that we draw upon that goes well well beyond that and thats also as you can imagine something that gives a lot more confidence is its not just prior history its a wealth of data that is used operator thank you our next question will come from vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you thanks for taking my questions mark and jane citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc mark i want to go to your revenue i hear you youre keeping the revenue guidance unchanged what is in your revenue assumption just want to unpeel that onion a little bit whats in your revenue assumption for rates us and internationally and what is going on with deposit betas particularly following the inflows youve seen recently in the us with the crisis mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so i guess a couple things one in terms of the rates that weve assumed in the balance of the year weve kind of assumed that rates would kind of probably rates would flatten out after this quarter after this second quarter and then trend down a bit towards the end of the year down a bit to something like or so so we may have one rate increase and then flat and then down to about that could change but candidly if it changes a little bit here or there its unlikely to have a meaningful impact in thats likely to have more of an impact in so we can debate that curve but thats kind of what we have thus far in our outlook the second point id make is around and thats us rates were assuming i dont have specifics in front of me in terms of the rate curves around the globe but we are assuming kind of continued rate increases there not of a significant magnitude but some assumptions there depending on where were talking about the beta assumptions that we have built in are for betas to continue to increase outside of the us but again they run lower than the us in general for our multinational clients we expect that we will see in the pbwm retail banking or the pbwm client segment space that clients are likely to move towards either higheryielding deposit products or investment products and so we factored those things into how we think about the outlook and could that change or evolve absolutely but thats kind of whats behind what weve assumed here vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and just as a clarification with the inflows youve seen recently in deposits with the crisis this is in the us obviously any other betas tempering a little bit how much those are going up is that slowing down or not any change so far mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so a couple things ill mention so one we did see inflows in the quarter associated with some of the sector turmoil weve looked at kind of deposit levels from call it march march through close to the end of march and we certainly did see an uptick call it probably a little bit under billion or so of inflows in that period of time with a good portion of that in our ccb our commercial middlemarket client base its too soon to tell kind of how betas evolve but we do think that a good portion of those deposits will likely be sticky i think whats important here is that a part of our strategy here is in fact growing operating deposits with our large multinational clients and our middlemarket clients and so were going to continue to be focused on that whats a little bit unclear is how the rate environment continues to evolve and what that means for how betas actually evolve right and well have to kind of wait and see its too soon to tell as it relates to that citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 operator thank you our next question will come from ken usdin with jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks hey mark just a followup on the credit so you mentioned obviously that you moved part of your cecl adjustment a little bit towards in your weightings and you had previously talked about getting towards normalized card losses i think youd said by around the end of the year so can you just given the changes that were seeing ahead of us and definitely saw some normalization happen this quarter can you just are you still online for that getting to that ph and in the respective card businesses by around yearend this year mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah yearend early next year yes were still kind of on track on trend for that again id expect that they pick up a little bit after that before they start tapering down but the answer to your question ken is yes thats still the timeline fourth quarter early reaching those normalized levels ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay cool and then one more just followup endofperiod deposits down you mentioned the taxes are the taxes did tax end up across the business when i look at the deposits page there are a lot of ins and there are a lot of outs on an endofperiod basis and just trying to get a sense of like what areas might have been impacted by that tax seasonality and where there was just some of the other pieces that youve already talked through in terms of inflows outflows and everything else in between mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah its a good question so again when you look at our deposits on an average basis you see on page that they tick up a little bit if you look at it on an end of period basis theyre down about and essentially intraquarter particularly in march as i mentioned earlier we did see a sizable increase in flows with that said if you remember in the fourth quarter we saw a nice runup in deposits and then we have the seasonality point that i referenced in my prepared remarks where we have both operational payments from our large tts clients as well as tax payments and with our tts clients also with wealth clients to some extent kind of playing through the end ofperiod deposits and again that for the most part is normal operating payments that wed expect to see at this time of year jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so no surprises mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc on what happened mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah operator thank you our last question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just one clarification on that last answer you said you had intraquarter flows did you gain more deposits in the month of march and was that in the us mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes we did yes thats what i was talking about mike in terms of those flows they did come largely in the us in the month of march call it march through kind of the end of march they were overshadowed by these normal payments that i referenced and we did and we still see good activity kind of even as we came through march and into early parts of april jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and that was both in the institutional business that we saw the inflows as well as in the pbwm mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah in wealth yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and if you define deposits this way i mean if im oversimplifying correct me but look you have multinationals you really target for payments capital markets and banking those companies have a lot of deposits a lot of services thats the stickiness and thats where you said of your clients in tts have been with you for over years what if the deposits for those multinationals and i know im asking you to slice and dice a little bit different way but even just a general sense because the reason im asking this is because i think theres a disconnect between showing percent of uninsured deposits as a measure of stickiness and i dont think thats valid and youve shared higher deposits even though you have a big percentage of uninsured deposits or maybe that doesnt matter as much as some front pages of newspapers are suggesting so if you could address that citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah thanks mike look id tell you to turn to page in the earnings presentation weve broken down the deposits for each of the businesses that we have and at the bottom you see the tts deposits and this is where the or so large multinational client deposits reside and you can see the stability as well as the steady growth in those deposits over time and to your point these are largely operational deposits that these clients have with us and we shouldnt mistake rate sensitivity or betas with stickiness right and its because these deposits tend to be quite sticky with us as you can see here now theyre pricesensitive in the sense that as rates go up we often have to reprice those but remember the relationships we have with these clients are broader than just deposit relationships and thats what gives us the opportunity to adjust pricing accordingly with our deposits both in the us and outside of the us and so the other page in your own time you can look at it is the page prior to that which ken speaks to the diversification of the portfolio but it also speaks to the length of time that many of these clients have been with us and have grown with us and so nearly of our deposits are from clients that have a greater than year relationship with us and that says a lot and so anyway those are the two points id make hopefully that addresses your question around the stickiness jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah and i often say it takes a root canal to extract us from the operations of our clients just because of exactly what were talking about here and thats also we see it even with the midmarket clients that are a growing portion here as well because were helping them expand internationally and that stickiness comes through and the lcr of is a very highquality lcr ratio operator thank you and there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to jen landis for closing remarks jennifer landis headinvestor relations
