officer director citigroup inc thank you jen and good morning to everyone while this quarter wasnt as eventful as the first quarter it was not without its moments the global economy continues to be remarkably resilient although the macro backdrop differs across key markets and while the bulk of the tightening is behind us central banks are responding vigorously to inflation and have made it clear the cycle hikes isnt over in the us the tight labor market keeps pushing the timing of this elusive recession later into this year or with the robust demand for services providing a backstop for the economy the us earnings has also exceeded expectations however most countries there are facing pressure from labor and energy costs challenging the regions longerterm competitiveness china is the biggest disappointment as growth decelerated after an initial postreopening pop i was there last month and lets just say a few on the ground expect china to be as strong a driver of global growth this year as some have hoped so bottom line globally we continue to see the same quite challenging macroeconomic conditions that we saw in the first quarter from citis perspective we continue to see the benefits of our diversified business model and strong balance sheet we remain laserfocused on executing our strategy and simplifying and modernizing our bank despite the turbulence and macro backdrop of the firsthalf were on track with the plan we laid out at investor day and we remain committed to our strategy and our mediumterm rotce target today we reported net income of billion and an eps of our revenues exdivestitures are relatively flat to last year and we remain on track to meet our revenue guidance of billion to billion for the year were also on track to meet the expense guidance for the year and consistent with the plan we shared with you at our investor day we are pursuing costsaving opportunities to help offset the significant investments in our transformation citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 in services tts continues to deliver with revenues up a healthy this was driven by both net interest income and noninterest revenue as we win feegenerating mandates with new clients and deepen our relationships with existing large corporate and commercial clients were proud of our number one ranking for large institutional clients and this week we announced our latest innovation citidirect commercial banking a digital platform to help our growing commercial clients tap into our global network securities services revenues were also up driven by higher interest rates across currencies were really pleased with execution in this business as we continue to bring in assets under custody and administration which are up by approximately trillion in the last year weve gained basis points in share yearoveryear as a result of the investments weve been making markets revenues were down compared to an exceptionally strong second quarter last year from early april clients stood on the sidelines as the debt ceiling played out and we continued to experience very low levels of volatility throughout the quarter despite this our corporate client flows remained strong and we achieved our mediumterm revenuetorwa target again this quarter in banking the momentum in investmentgrade debt has spread into other dcm products but the longawaited rebound in investment banking has yet to materialize and it was a disappointing quarter in terms of both the wallet and our own performance with investment banking revenues down we continue to rightsize the business through the environment whilst making investments in selected areas such as technology and healthcare in the us taken together our cards businesses had doubledigit revenue growth aided by customer engagement and the continued normalization in payment rates in branded cards spend is still strong in travel and entertainment and acquisitions remain pretty healthy this is a great franchise and we have launched a raft of new innovations from transforming our thankyou rewards platform to our enhanced value proposition for the premium card with our longterm partner american airlines credit normalization is happening faster in retail services given the profile of the portfolio and overall i would say were seeing a more cautious consumer but not necessarily a recessionary one wealth revenues were down as the business continues to be negatively impacted by the deposit mix shift particularly in the private bank and by lower investment revenues however we have seen activity pick up a bit in asia for two quarters with growing net new assets referrals from the us retail banks are increasing and globally new client acquisition in the private bank and wealth at work has grown significantly on the back of our investments in our network of client advisors and bankers turning to expenses they were elevated this quarter as we expected this includes the additional repositioning actions we took to rightsize certain businesses and functions in light of the current environment yeartodate severance is about million including million in the quarter separate to repositioning we remain committed to bending our expense curve by the end of through three significant efforts first we continue to make investments in our transformation and other risk and control initiatives which are necessary to modernize our infrastructure automate our controls as well as to improve the client experience as we said before we will start to see the more material benefits of these investments over the mediumterm citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 second as part of our simplification efforts we expect to close the sales of our remaining two asia consumer franchises by yearend and we plan to restart the exit process in poland as you can see on the slide we made excellent progress this quarter in the consumer businesses were winding down aided by material asset sales and we are now attacking stranded costs and closing out the tsas in the markets that we have already exited you saw our determination to execute when we decided to ipo banamex after exploring a sale we should complete the process of separating the two businesses fully next year in preparation for the ipo and im pleased with the progress on the ground we are about to begin acceptance testing on the new systems for the retained businesses all this means that by yearend considering how far the divestitures and winddowns have progressed legacy franchises will have materially reduced its exposures and primarily be down to mexico poland korea and the elimination of the remaining stranded costs as such as we move through the second half of the year we will be in a position to focus on the third leg of bringing down our expense base through a leaner organizational model together these three efforts are why we have confidence in saying that we will start to bend the curve on an absolute basis by the end of and continue to bring down expenses over the mediumterm let me end with capital while you wont be shocked to hear that we were disappointed with the increase to our stress capital buffer we have engaged in active dialogue with the fed to better understand the differences between our model and theirs in terms of noninterest revenue and the industry awaits further clarity on capital requirements and importantly their implementation timing from the holistic review the regulators have undertaken and the expected basel iii endgame npr there is still uncertainty as to what the final rules will be and we like the rest of the industry will need to work through the implication the exit of international consumer markets coupled with the results of our transformation investments and change in business mix will help reduce our capital ratios in addition we have other levers to pull over time such as capital allocation dta utilization our gsib score and our management buffer of basis points we are committed to returning capital to our shareholders as you saw with our decisions to repurchase billion in common stock and increase the dividend we ended the second quarter with a cet1 ratio of thats basis points above our upcoming requirement after returning a total of billion in capital and we grew our tangible book value per share to given the environment we will continue to look at our level of capital return on a quartertoquarter basis overall were pleased with the progress weve made but there remains a lot to do we will continue to update you on the progress we are making every quarter and with that id like to turn it over to mark and then we would both be delighted as always to take your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks jane and good morning everyone im going to start with the firmwide financial results focusing on year overyear comparisons for the second quarter unless i indicate otherwise and spend a little more time on expenses and capital then i will turn to the results of each segment on slide we show financial results for the full firm in the second quarter we reported net income of approximately billion and an eps of and an rotce of on billion of revenues embedded in these results are aftertax divestiturerelated impacts of approximately million excluding these items eps was with an rotce of citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 in the quarter total revenues decreased by both on a reported basis and excluding divestiturerelated impacts as strength across services us personal banking and revenue from the investment portfolio was more than offset by declines in markets investment banking and wealth as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exits and winddowns our results include expenses of billion up both on a reported basis and excluding divestiturerelated costs cost of credit was approximately billion primarily driven by the continued normalization in cards net credit losses and acl builds largely related to growth in card balances our effective tax rate this quarter was primarily driven by the geographic mix of our pretax earnings in the quarter excluding current quarter divestiturerelated impacts our effective tax rate was at the end of the quarter we had over billion in total reserves with a reservetofunded loans ratio of approximately and through the firsthalf of we reported an rotce of on slide we show the quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear expense variance for the second quarter expenses were up driven by a number of factors including investment in risk and controls businessled and enterpriseled investments volume growth and macro factors including inflation as well as severance and all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exits and winddowns severance in the quarter was approximately million and million yeartodate as we took further actions across investment banking markets and the functions were investing in the execution of our transformation and continue to see a shift in our investments from thirdparty consulting to technology and fulltime employees and as we said last quarter our transformation in technology investments span across the following themes platform and process simplification security and infrastructure modernization client experience enhancements and data improvements and across these themes technology spend was billion in the quarter up primarily driven by change in the bank spend despite the higher expense base sequentially we remain inline with our fullyear guidance of roughly billion excluding divestiturerelated impacts and the fdic special assessment on slide we show net interest income deposits and loans where ill speak to sequential variances in the second quarter net interest income increased by approximately million largely driven by dividends the increase in net interest income exmarkets was largely driven by higher rates and cards growth partially offset by the mix shift that weve seen to higher rate deposit products within pbwm average loans were flat as growth in pbwm was offset by the winddown in markets and a decline in icg as we continue to optimize the loan portfolio including a further reduction in subscription credit facilities average deposits were down largely driven by tts revenues as we saw some nonoperational outflow as expected in light of quantitative tightening however underlying this we did see strong growth in operating accounts as we continue to win new clients and deepen with existing ones and our net interest margin increased basis points on slide we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics were wellreserved for the current environment with over billion of total reserves our reservestofunded loans ratio is approximately and within that us cards is in pbwm of our lending exposures are in us cards and of that exposure is to customers with ficos of or higher and ncl rates are still below precovid levels and are normalizing in line with our expectations the remaining of our pbwm lending exposure is largely in wealth predominantly in mortgages and margin lending in our icg portfolio of our total exposure approximately is investment grade of the international exposure approximately is investmentgrade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries and corporate nonaccrual loans remain low at about basis points of total loans as you can see on the page we break out our commercial real estate lending exposures across icg and pbwm which citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 total billion of which is investmentgrade so while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain we feel very good about our asset quality exposures and reserve levels and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios on slide we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics we maintained a very strong trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a welldiversified trillion deposit base across regions industries customers and account types which is deployed into highquality diversified assets our balance sheet reflects our strategy and welldiversified business model we leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates financial institutions investors and individuals with global needs the majority of our deposits billion are institutional and operational in nature and span across countries these institutional deposits are complemented by billion of us retail consumer and global wealth deposits as you can see on the bottom rightside of the page we have approximately billion of hqla and approximately billion of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of just under trillion our lcr was relatively stable at and our net stable funding ratio was greater than we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio and our tangible book value per share was up from a year ago on slide we show a sequential cet1 walk to provide more details on the drivers this quarter starting from the end of the first quarter first we generated billion of net incometocommon which added basis points second we returned billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases which drove a reduction of about basis points and finally the remaining 14basis point decrease was primarily driven by rwa growth as we continued to grow card balances partially offset by optimizing rwa in markets and corporate lending we ended the quarter with a cet1 capital ratio which includes basis point internal management buffer we expect our regulatory capital requirement to be in october of which incorporates the increase in our stress capital buffer from to the preliminary scb of we announced a couple of weeks ago and we will continue our dialogue with the fed to better understand the differences between their modeled results and ours specifically in noninterest revenue that said our strategy is designed to further diversify our business mix to have a more consistent predictable and repeatable revenue stream as well as reduce risks and simplify our firm by exiting international consumer markets the strategy and the simplification coupled with the benefits of our transformation investments will allow us to improve rwa and capital over time the continued optimization of our balance sheet should not only help scb but reduce rwa this will offset some of the anticipated headwinds in capital requirements and rwa and we will continue to reassess how and where we deploy capital and we will continue to reassess the appropriate level of our management buffer over time on slide we show the results for our institutional clients group for the second quarter revenues were down this quarter as growth in services was more than offset by markets and banking expenses increased primarily driven by continued investments in tts and risk and controls as well as approximately million of severance in investment banking and markets partially offset by productivity savings cost of credit was million as net credit losses were partially offset by an acl release this resulted in net income of approximately billion down primarily driven by lower revenues and higher expenses icg delivered an rotce of for the quarter and through the firsthalf of average loans were down reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns average deposits were up as we continued to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 on slide we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at investor day in treasury and trade solutions revenues were up driven by growth in net interest income and in noninterest revenue its also worth noting that tts revenues were up on an exfx basis we continue to see healthy underlying drivers in tts that indicate consistently strong client activity with us dollar clearing volumes up both in the quarter and through the firsthalf crossborder flows up outpacing global gdp growth again both in the quarter and through the first half and commercial card volumes up roughly led by spend in travel in fact similar to the last few quarters client wins are up approximately across all client segments these include marquee transactions where we are serving as the clients primary operating bank in securities services revenues were also up driven by higher net interest income across currencies we are pleased with the progress in securities services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration which are up approximately or trillion and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals in securities services as a reminder the services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higherreturning businesses with strong synergies across the firm markets revenues were down driven by both fixed income and equities relative to an exceptional quarter last year coupled with low volatility this quarter fixed income revenues were down as strength in our rates franchise was more than offset by a decline in currencies and commodities equities revenues were down primarily reflecting a decline in equity derivatives but consistent with our strategy we continue to grow prime balances driven by client wins corporate client flows remained strong and stable and we continued to make solid progress on our revenuetorwa target and finally banking revenues excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were down driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty continued to impact client activity as well as lower revenues in corporate lending while we continue to have a strong pipeline and are seeing green shoots of activity we recognize theres more work to do in ecm and ma that said we believe the investments that weve made in healthcare and technology coverage will benefit us over time so overall while the market environment remains challenging and theres more work to be done were making progress against our strategy in icg now turning to slide we show the results for our personal banking and wealth management business revenues were up driven by net interest income growth of partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue driven by lower investment product revenues in wealth expenses were up predominantly driven by risk and control investments cost of credit was billion driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios and a reserve build of approximately million primarily driven by card balance growth average loans increased driven by cards mortgages and installment lending average deposits decreased largely reflecting our wealth clients putting cash to work and fixed income investments on our platform and pbwm delivered an rotce of both for this quarter and through the firsthalf of largely reflecting the challenging environment for wealth and higher credit cost on slide we show pbwm revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics branded cards revenues were up primarily driven by higher net interest income we continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up card spend volumes up and average loans up retail services revenues were up driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments for both card portfolios we continue to see payment rates decline and that combined with the investments that weve been making contributed to growth in interestearning balances of in branded cards and in retail services citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 retail banking revenues decreased reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business in fact consistent with our strategy we continued to leverage our retail network to drive wealth referrals yeartodate through may up yearoveryear wealth revenues were down driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs particularly in the private bank however wealth at work revenues were up over driven by strong lending results primarily in mortgages client advisors were down reflecting the repacing of strategic hiring and new client acquisitions were up nearly in the private bank and approximately in wealth at work in the second quarter while theres clearly more work to do in wealth we are seeing good momentum in the underlying drivers on slide we show results for legacy franchises revenues were down as the benefit of higher rates and volumes in mexico was more than offset by the reductions from closed consumer exits and winddowns its worth noting that mexicos revenues were up and exfx expenses decreased primarily driven by closed consumer exits and winddowns excluding divestiturerelated impacts expenses decreased on slide we show results for corporateother for the second quarter revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio expenses also increased driven by inflation and severance on slide ill briefly touch on our third quarter and fullyear outlook we are maintaining our fullyear revenue guidance of billion to billion excluding divestiturerelated impacts although the mix has shifted somewhat we are increasing our net interest income guidance from billion to slightly above billion for the fullyear excluding markets offset by lower noninterest revenue largely driven by investment banking and wealth we are also maintaining our expense guidance of roughly billion excluding divestiturerelated impacts and the fdic special assessment net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize in the remainder of the year with both portfolios reaching normalized levels by yearend and we now expect the fullyear tax rate to be approximately excluding discrete items and divestiturerelated impacts as it relates to the third quarter we expect continued momentum with clients including fees and benefits from us and nonus rates on nii we also anticipate a sequential increase in expenses driven by continued investments in transformation and risk and controls net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize inline with expectations and our effective tax rate for the quarter should be approximately excluding discrete items and divestiturerelated impacts and as it relates to buybacks we will continue to make that decision on a quarterby quarter basis before we move to qa id like to end with a few points we continue to execute on the strategy to simplify our firm improve our revenue mix and bring both expenses and capital down over time were seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses and as we said at investor day the financial path will not be linear but we remain focused on achieving our mediumterm rotce target and with that jane and i would be happy to take your questions citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question comes from glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much so im very curious on the whole revenuetorwa topic especially with some of the changes coming in so maybe you could give a little more color on lets say for instance the further reduction in the subscription credit facility i think i read somewhere that was like an billion book down to billion you can correct that if thats wrong but just usually those things are big important clients that have relationship lending things attached to them so im curious on how you balance the capital benefit the clear capital benefit versus the client impact and how you think about that are there other blocks of business that are in motion right now thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks glenn and good morning thanks for the question look a couple of points on that one is weve been very focused on the revenuetorwa metric in our markets business and the icg more broadly as well and weve made considerable progress on that and thats important because how we use the balance sheet in assuring that were optimizing the use of the balance sheet contributes to how we improve returns over time youre right to point out the subscription credit facility lending that we do we brought that down pretty significantly the numbers you highlight are a lot higher than the portfolio but whats important here is that as we look at that we look at a couple things so one the nature of the relationship and whether clients are taking advantage of the breadth of what we have to offer two the profitability and returns associated with the product to the extent that it is in a broader relationship and where those returns are low subpar and the prospect for doing more has proven to be fruitless we take it down and thats what weve done with a large part of that book just as we juxtapose it against other opportunities to use balance sheet where clients are taking advantage of the broader franchise and therefore are generating higher returns and were going to continue to do that weve done that to drive the revenuetorwa metric weve done it selectively on pieces of the portfolio like scf weve also looked at our broader corporate lending portfolio and where those promises for higher relationship returns arent manifesting themselves weve not renewed those loans and as we think about pending regulatory changes proactively making these efforts becomes critically important when i look back on the activity that weve done over the past couple of years weve reduced rwa by approximately billion over the last two years and about of that is predominantly driven by balance sheet optimization and looking at client activity that has lowmargin business and so this is important for us to do were going to keep doing glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate that mark maybe just a quick followup on nii i asked this last quarter too and your firsthalf annualized exmarkets is running about billion ahead of the guide is that just the unpredictable nature of all of the moving parts trying to be conservative or anything else in the backhalf that youre thinking about citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks glenn yeah we did take guidance up to above slightly above billion from the billion i guess there are a couple things in exmarkets of course there are a couple things to think about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds that play through there one is youve heard me mention before that weve reached terminal betas in the us two deposit volumes and the shift mix as we see consumers kind of move into higherreturning type higheryielding type products and three really the winddowns and the exits and the reduction that they will play out in terms of nii so those are kind of three headwinds as we think about the forecast and the balance of the year there are obviously some potential tailwinds that play to the other side including rate movements in nonus dollar as well as card volume growth and as we look at those headwinds and tailwinds our current read is to take it up but billion or slightly above that feels like the right level in the context of total revenues at billion to billion operator and our next question comes from jim mitchell with seaport global securities james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just getting on the expense side youre keeping mexico till now at the earliest so that will be on the books longer how do we think about that bend the curve discussion and maybe specifically you can help us think about bending the curve for the nonlegacy businesses do we start to see is the fourth quarter just a slowing or quarterly decline is it a yearoveryear kind of discussion just want to make sure i understand the whole bend the curve notion and how to think about that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc okay thank you let me take that id say a couple things so one id reiterate the expense guidance that weve given for the fullyear so thats the roughly billion exdivestitures or the impact of divestitures ex any impact from fdic special assessment two as we think about bending the curve i look into and were looking to bring the absolute expense dollars down from  to  so that bending of the curve will occur it will occur despite having mexico still part of the franchise obviously still having mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend but it will bend  to  and then beyond that and through the mediumterm we will see the curve continue to bend again mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend but were very very focused on bringing our cost down and bending that curve and youve heard us reference the aspects or the elements of our business that help contribute to that not the least of which are the exits one of which is mexico and you referenced the timing there but also the benefits from the investments that weve been making in transformation and risk and controls and shifting from manual processes to technologyenabled ones and then the final one is around simplifying our organization and you heard in janes prepared remarks as we continue to make progress on these exits it opens up the opportunity for us to lean more heavily into that simplification so we are focused on not only the guidance but the bending of the curve as you point out and looking forward to delivering that and taking actions to ensure we do james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 so just as a followup is the way to think about sort of and beyond as you get through a lot of the automation on the sort of the nonlegacy businesses and start to get much more efficient there can we is there an absolute expense decline story in the core business or is that more of a you need the top line growth to get the improved returns mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc again its going to be a combination of continuing to bendthe curve and bring our expenses down obviously weve given you guidance on operating efficiency of less than which will be some of that top line growth but its the combination of the two operator and our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to confirm on the cet1 you have basis point buffer on top of regulatory minimums so that would suggest that the that you got this quarter is inline with where youre planning on holding it going forward is that fair mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so youre right we hit this quarter down a tad bit from the last quarter effective october the scb comes into play and so that would equate to assuming the basis point management buffer at regulatory requirement and a kind of target that we would management too id highlight a couple things that im sure are obvious to you betsy one is this is the stress capital buffer for the 12month period starting october and two is the strategy that we have described and talked about and have started to execute against is intentionally designed to help morph the business towards a more steady predictable consistent stream of revenues fee revenue growth as well as bring our expenses down over time and exit these markets and those things should contribute to reducing our stress capital buffer over time and improving our returns but the answer to your question very directly is yes the would reflect where wed be targeting as of october for now citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and since you mentioned youre evaluating buybacks quarterbyquarter i guess the question here is how should i think about that relative to we get sic basel iii endgame coming out soon because clearly when youre at against the new rate cap scb it signals a bigger opportunity for buybacks over the coming quarter so how should i think about that jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc i think consistent with what weve been talking about theres a lot of uncertainty out there about the new capital requirements both in terms of the nature of them and the timing of implementation i think the industry is expecting to get more clarity about that with the comment period that will be coming up plus its a fairly uncertain macroeconomic environment at the moment so both mark and i feel its prudent to continue making that assessment until some of this uncertainty is clarified as to what precisely well do you should take confidence that were at the levels including the management buffer that we expect to be for the rest of the year weve proven a good case of being able to build capital thats for sure over the last two years and where you take comfort as well we increased the dividend we had billion of capital returned last quarter so our intentions are clear to return capital where we can but also to be prudent in how we do so given the environment and current regulatory uncertainty operator and our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi one negative question one positive question so on the negative side you talked about bending the cost curve but i think second quarter yearoveryear its bending the wrong way and six quarters from now youre saying it should bend the other way so what are we not seeing in the financials that gives you such confidence because it seems based on this quarters results a little bit more of a trust me story and on the positive side tts has continued doubledigit growth you continue to invest more in that business how are you monetizing greater money emotion among your multinational and other clients thanks jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc thanks mike ill kick it off and then send it back to mark in terms of the expense side weve been very transparent about the ark of our investment spend related both to transformation and beyond well continue to give you that transparency mike note last year we hit our expense guidance this year were on track for the guidance of roughly the billion exfdic and divestitures and looking forward we continue to guide what are the three levers that will drive the reduction in the expense curve starting at the end of its from the exits and i think youve got a clear sense around the progress that we have been making on the divestitures and therefore were pivoting as we talked about to focus now on really tackling those stranded expenses as we close off the final couple of sales there in asia in the next few months well realize the benefits for our investments in transformation and controls over the mediumterm well also have the benefit of the remediation work getting done and expenses going away from that and then the third one will be simplifying the organization as we talked about citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 so well continue to walk you stepbystep what are the different actions were taking what are we doing and hopefully were building up that track record of doing what we will say we are going to do every quarter mark anything to add mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc the only thing i would add on the expense side i mean you may want to touch on the tts but the only thing id add on the expense side is the we are taking repositioning charges mike i mean were not sitting still as we go through this uncertain period of time where wallets across certain parts of the industry are under significant pressure and in taking those repositioning charges theyre going to be expense reductions that ultimately play out over the next 12month period so thats the other factor in addition to what jane mentioned in the way of exits and benefits from the transformation that will play into the cost base over the next months jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and then on tts i think we all share your enthusiasm for this business in terms of the growth potential that weve been realizing and expect to continue albeit converging now to the mediumterm guidance over the next few quarters where we see its a high to medium singledigit growth going forward its a very highreturning business and some of the indicators of how were monetizing those relationships were seeing it both in terms of new client wins they were up this quarter we have a sustained winloss ratio of on the new deals across different client segments were also seeing growth thats starting to really kick in from our commercial bank and the expansion of clients in the middlemarket around the world as we grow out that franchise and weve got some very good fee growth which as mark points out and i point out all the time were very focused around crossborder up us dollar clearing up commercial card is up et cetera and we continue to invest in the business as well so to make sure that that win ratio continues so first bank to launch us dollar clearing weve got the instant payments platform we just launched for ecommerce clients we have payments express that is now live in the us on track for five markets by the yearend so its a story of innovation its a story of investment its got great returns its a good growth story and it keeps on going and i dont want to diminish securities services in there either its another business thats similarly continuing to see significant client wins up versus last year as well and a lot of our strategy there has been focused on gaining share with the asset managers in north america a couple of years ago were down at share were up about our target is about there in in that key growth area and theres a lot to like here too operator and our next question comes from erika najarian with ubs erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning or good afternoon so i apologize having to ask the expense question again but i think its just very important because theres really two potential longonly investment phases on citi right one is the buyback given your tangible book values at and the stocks at and the other is this bending the curve on expenses citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 so let me just ask jims question another way in looking back to and im just looking at because i can breakout legacy and core that way and ill fast forward to you produced revenues exlegacy franchises about billion in and about billion in the associated expenses again without legacy franchises was about billion in versus billion in so youre surpassing the revenue uplift during that period by billion i guess the question is you have so much certainty about the timing of this expense and im wondering how much of this billion can go away we understand theres a lot of opportunity for reinvestment in the core business but i think all of us are struggling to really understand that magnitude and i think that the investor base and the market fully understands the legacy franchises story and how the exits will take time but i think theyre most interested in the core business and how much of that can come out mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure look no need to apologize for asking the question again its an important topic i would say a couple things so one is that we can certainly look back in time but i would highlight that were here because we needed to have invested more in our franchise and so undoubtedly theres going to be an increase in our expense base that reflects the underinvestment from the past and in shoring up safety and soundness and actually moving towards a more automated operational more modernized operations and infrastructure so theres certainly going to be that with that said with those investments come efficiencies so with the move from manual to automation over time those types of investments will yield benefits in our cost structure and thats part of what is going to bend the curve over that mediumterm period the other thing that id highlight is obviously with the legacy franchises theres billion of expense associated with those and that will come down but because of the mexico transaction were going to be stuck with that a little bit longer given the ipo process it doesnt put a big dent in our ability to bring stranded costs down and by the way it does come with top line revenues and historically has been accretive to our profitability and returns and so i highlight i mean im not going to give you kind of new guidance on where our expenses will end up but what i will point you to is not only the billion this year roughly billion this year not only the bending of the curve in the third and fourth quarter or the third to the fourth quarter next year but weve given guidance on top line growth revenue of call it cagr through that mediumterm period and weve given you kind of operating efficiency targets that weve set as well and we intend to deliver on those things that reflect the bending of that curve through all of those drivers that weve mentioned so i hope that helps erika i appreciate the focus on both capital and expenses we are equally focused on it and know just how important it is to achieving those targets were not only kind of doing the things that weve highlighted in that strategy articulation but were also being responsive to the current environment that were in we think that aides in our ability to deliver the targets and the bending of the curve and we know theres an additional opportunity that jane has referenced to the simplification of the organization as we make what i would argue is considerable progress on the exits towards the end of this year and all of those things will be important to ensuring we get to that lower cost base which we will do jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 and its a laser micro focus from us to make sure that we have the plans in place and the execution to be able to achieve it this is something that were extremely handson around and making sure that that is going to get done on each of the different drivers that mark talked about operator and our next question oops go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc sorry and just to followup on that i guess you guys have been pretty clear on the timing and you guys have been pretty clear on why the curve will bend i guess im wondering is it just a timing issue that youre not giving us the sort of the dollar numbers that could go away from the transformation is it just a timing issue or are you still at a point where you dont know how much of that you would need to reinvest to arrive at that revenue cagr mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sorry your question was around expenses or the revenue erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc expenses so we get loud and clear why the curve will bend mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc we get loud and clear when the curve will bend right mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes yes erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and theres clearly just expenses there that are catchup expenses that are transformational expenses mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc so everything that jane talked about and that message has been loud and clear citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and im wondering if you havent told us what could come out of those expenses because its just a timing issue its july versus or have you not yet made decisions in terms of how you may allocate those expenses in terms of do you need some of those expenses that could come out to grow your revenue base to that cagr versus having it fall to the bottom line sorry thats the question mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc got it jane you want to start or i jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc no go ahead mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc okay yeah so id say a couple things so one erika is obviously with that revenue cagr will be volume related expenses that play out but were also focused obviously on the nonvolumerelated expenses and not giving you a precise number because the magnitude of that bend is a factor so obviously mexico for example as i mentioned earlier impacts the magnitude of the bend and were going to and have in fact when you look at our expense base even for the quarter weve spent money in mexico to drive that top line revenue growth exfx and so theyre going to be nuances in the running of the business in a way that ensures were maximizing shareholder value that impacts the magnitude of the bending of that expense curve investments that i got to continue to make in tts in order to maintain that number one position and that competitive advantage that we have and so those things will impact that magnitude of the bend weve been i think very transparent as we get into each year giving you concrete numbers what im telling you is the curve will bend and as we get closer to well give you more direction on the magnitude for that year and beyond operator and our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good afternoon mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hi steven jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 hey steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted hey wanted to ask a question on capital just given the recent increase in your scb i was hoping to better understand why the to remains the appropriate longterm objective in your mind and as we prepare for basel iii endgame think through the capital benefit from future asset sales can you speak to whether that will translate into operational risk capital release specifically as its less clear whether those benefits will accrete even as those asset sales are consummated jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc ill kick it off mark and then pass it to you so when we look were confident were going to meet the to rotce target over the mediumterm the core drivers of how we get there remains unchanged one its the revenue so expect to grow by to cagr as we continue to execute on the strategy on expenses its the clear path to bend the curve by the end of bringing those expenses down over the mediumterm and third and importantly its continuing to optimize our balance sheet including improving rwa and capital efficiency and as we referenced earlier in the prepared remarks different drivers in that that are helpful exiting international consumer markets changing our business mix and id also note that the transformation has benefits not only for our efficiency but it will also support rwa and capital optimization that said theres uncertainty around the future capital requirements in the industry and importantly the timing of their implementation we like everyone again have to work through those implications once we know what they are but as we said keep in mind weve got some other levers to pull over time capital allocation dta allocation and utilization our gsib score and our management buffer of basis points so thats where you hear the confidence for us from us around the path to executing and that remaining consistent but mark why dont i hand over to you just around consumer market sales and operational our rwa release mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure and again i think that if you look at the transactions that weve closed todate theyve generated or freed up about billion of capital the two that remain to be closed in the balance of the year will generate another billion or so that will be important to our capital base i think that we obviously have to see the proposal as it comes out the npr and we have to well have a window to respond to that were hopeful that the regulators hear our response and views on it as it comes out theres clearly going to be reference to increases in rwa and operational risk implications potentially as part of that i do think that exiting without having seen the proposal and without obviously knowing how those rules might evolve i do believe that the exiting of these markets does play towards not only reducing our scb and stress scenarios or as it comes out of stress analysis and tests but also should play through helping to reduce risk weighted assets and potentially our operational risk as well but we have to see what the proposal looks like and go through that and i think whats important here is that whenever it comes out whatever it looks like as we dissect it and go through it well figure out how to manage through it whether that be through exiting certain products seeking price adjustments as it relates to customers clients and the markets or continuing to optimize rwa as we have been doing very proactively well figure out how to manage citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and i feel compelled to jump in here as well because as the spring and the recent test results showed the large us banks are not only in a strong capital position but weve been able to play an important stabilizing role for the system as a whole its a role that we take very seriously and we certainly hope that as the details of the capital frameworks get unveiled that this is fully taken into consideration including the impact on us competitiveness and we need a level playing field with europe not a goldplated one and we share the concern that higher capital levels will undoubtedly increase the cost of capital for medium and smallersized enterprises and consumers in particular and will drive more activity to nonregulated and lesser capitalized players that isnt in the systems interest and we hope that thats fully taken into consideration here because we will take actions on businesses and we will take pricing actions as will the entire industry mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc really important point steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc yeah thanks for that perspective jane very well said just one quick followup for me pbwm fee income trends given the lower partner payments i mean clearly the wealth fee trends would suggest that they were quite subdued in the quarter i just wanted to understand your outlook over the near to mediumterm what drove some of the weakness this quarter is it something that you expect will likely persist especially given some of the market tailwinds that weve been seeing would have expected to see a little bit more resiliency in wealth fee income in particular mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look i think as we mentioned wealth was down about its really hard to talk about the rebound in wealth in the midst of such an uncertain environment and the one that were in its hard to disconnect those macro factors like rates inflation the prospect of a recession from what were seeing in wealth and i think there are two dynamics that have played out one has been the shift from our customers from customers more broadly into higheryielding products from out of deposits and the other has been the fee revenue from an investment management fee point of view and as you might think about it it is a higher rate environment there are opportunities for clients to earn more and not until theres greater certainty in the broader macro factors will i think we start to see some real momentum tick up there now with that said and a couple of things worth reiterating which is were seeing very strong referral momentum from the retail banking business up through the wealth continuum if you will so weve had about referrals may yeartodate from our retail branches into our broader wealth business thats a good thing weve seen the number of clients that weve onboarded tick up pretty meaningfully both in the private bank and more broadly across wealth thats a good thing those are things that position us well for when greater certainty does play out and these clients start to put monies back to work in the broader investment platform and offering that we have operator and our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon just one quick question mark for you on the consumer cost book you gave some metrics one can you remind us what you reserved for in terms of unemployment rate macro and whether if we do see indiscernible market does that necessarily mean that well see a big ratcheting up of current result where you already are just something around that would be helpful mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sorry just the last part of your question im sorry if we do see what ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah yeah so one like where are you in terms of your unemployment rate assumption and if the unemployment outlook worsened lets say over the next six to months does that mean that you are already reserved or will we see another big pick up in provisioning as a result of that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc got it thank you look our current reserves as you know as we think about cecl weve got three different set of scenarios weve got a base case an upside a downside our current reserves are based on the mix of those three macroeconomic scenarios it reflects about a unemployment rate on a weighted bases over the eight quarters and its roughly flat to what it was last quarter what that means is obviously our downside scenario has unemployment thats much higher than that closer to well call it or so but thats kind of how weve thought about unemployment as we think about the reserves each quarter obviously we take a look at the macroeconomic factors and how theyre evolving our base case today assumes a mild recession and reserves in the future well consider how our weighting towards downside upside and baseline may morph subject to our outlook and volumes those are the two factors that influence whether were increasing reserves or not i would point out though that in addition to unemployment and because unemployment has been as stubborn as it has been if you will we also look at debt service coverage ratio as an important factor as we think about our consumers as we think about their balance sheet as we think about the risk that they may or may not be facing so unemployment is an important factor but weve flexed our thinking in light of the environment and in light of how behaviors have been shifting and thats an important factor in how we think about our reserves as well i feel very good about the level of our reserves you heard us mention earlier weve got billion of reserves were wellreserved across the portfolio but those are allimportant elements to it ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just one very simplistic question when you talk to some of your largest shareholders those who are optimistic who think you can hit your rotce target mediumterm by is that a realistic expectation given i appreciate basel exchanges you answered like questions on expenses but should we expect the groundwork through that we hit that mediumterm target in or just your degree of confidence thats it citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah again the thing id point out and jane feel free to chime in here is that what we talked about was getting to our mediumterm returns to and the medium term is to so its not just just to be clear and we do continue to feel very confident around our ability to do that you heard us mention the levers that we think will contribute to that obviously capital is important in how that evolves and we continue to kind of work to optimize the balance sheet while serving our clients effectively and importantly growing the strong businesses that we have that are highreturning as well operator and our next question comes from matt oconnor from deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi actually a followup on credit here you talked about continued normalization of credit card in the backhalf of the year and just wondering youve got the normalized loss rates on slide are you still thinking youll hit those i think exiting this year or early next year and i think at one point you said they might go a little bit above that before they kind of come back to a normal level and is that still the case mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes thanks for the question the answer is yes we still expect for both portfolios to hit those normal levels some time at the end of the year the normal levels as you point out are on the page for both branded as well as for retail services we would expect again subject to how and when this mild recession kind of plays out we would expect that they would tick higher than that before getting back inside of that range but again all of this is tied into how weve calculated our reserves the delinquencies that were seeing the mix of the portfolio which again skews towards your higher fico scores and the customer behaviors that were seeing which play through not only that cost of credit line but also plays through the growth that we referenced earlier in the top line but the short answer is yes thats still our thinking jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and as mark said i think we feel good about our positioning as a prime but also a strong credit proposition that we have were seeing stronger demand for the creditled products such as value cards indiscernible and installment loans as well as the serviceled engagement for the more prime customers and so thats also going to be a valuable factor driving growth and profitability as well matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then on the followup and this is not really citispecific but for the card industry there are a lot of the banks that are in card everyone is talking about kind of getting these normalized levels just call it in the nearterm here or next couple quarters and i guess just thoughts on getting this normalized level of losses when unemployment is alltime low wages are growing obviously theres inflationary pressures but its just a little surprising again not citispecific but its a little surprising that were getting to this normalized state when things feel like theyre pretty good citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah i think well also normalized state back in was also pretty good so youre not hearing any alarm bells ringing from mark or myself at all here on the us consumer i think we see the us consumer as resilient weve talked about them being cautious but theyre not recessionary and we are seeing more pressure on the lower ficos we dont have a large number of that in our portfolio but that is where were seeing more of the normalization happening on the payment rates for example and other behaviors in there so its quite localized but i dont think we should be overly concerned here about the health of the us consumer and as mark said were in a very unusual environment higher inflation so these rate levels and a strong labor market and under those conditions its the debt service ratio as he said that is we think is a more useful leading indicator that we keep a close eye on mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc just remember its the return to normal jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc right operator and our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi jane hi mark jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mark can you share with us in your financial supplement obviously you gave us good details on you credit pictures and were talking about credit right now and the nonaccrual loans have been flat as a pancake for the last 12months for you folks and the industry as well and this is in light of the fed funds rates as we all know have been up over basis points can you guys share with us whats why we havent seen more and this is mostly corporate of course but everybodys been hanging in there very well in view of the fact that rates have gone up so much what are your customers telling you or are you seeing that has enabled them to remain very healthy in light of a 500basis point increase in interest rates citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i think id point to a couple things gerard one is remember we focus on the large multinational largely investmentgrade quality names and so thats one important factor when you think about our icg and corporate exposure there the second thing id point out is we have to remember that many of these companies had and still have very strong balance sheets and that theyve managed that through the covid and pandemic situation and that has positioned them well i think the third thing is that and youve heard us mention how we are proactively managing the prospect of a recession and i think when i talk to other cfos i know that when jane talks to other ceos they too are looking at their expense line they too are looking at the efficiency of their organizations and opportunity to increase that efficiency in light of a potential slowdown or a recessionary environment and then the final point is i think a lot of firms have been that were proactive in the low rate environment in shoring up that balance sheet strength now with that said youve heard us also mention the prospect of a rebound in capital market activity that has to happen at some point but sticking to your point around credit i really think its those factors that you see play through in not only our very low nal but also our very low credit losses credit costs that youve seen in our business gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then as a follow up when you think about what weve seen with the feds tightening over the last months banks like your own have positioned the balance sheet accordingly and i know the bancanalysts association of boston michael did a good job of explaining how you guys manage the balance sheet and how when you look at it going forward do you think changes are coming because the fed if they end the fed funds rate increases we get to a terminal rate how are you guys positioning the balance sheet do you think going forward mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc look were constantly actively managing the balance sheet in light of not only our client needs but also how we see the broader macro environment evolving and changing and as you know and i know youve seen and weve talked about before we shared in our qs our view or our estimate for interest rate exposure and what happens with the basis point swing in rates in one direction or another across the curve across currencies youve seen that shift over the last number of quarters to the last quarter where that estimate for ire was about billion or so but heavily skewed towards nonus dollar rates and currencies and i think as we think about the view on how rates will evolve youll see a continued shift there i think that when we look to print this quarter that number will probably come down a bit in terms of interest rate exposure and skew even more towards nonus dollar currencies in light of where rates are in those markets and the us dollar will likely be somewhat neutral in light of what that curve currently looks like but again something we actively manage first with an eye towards what client demand and needs are likely to be for use of our liquidity but also with the view for how the macro environment might evolve and what were hearing from central banks around the world citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 operator and our next question comes from vivek juneja with jpmorgan im sorry we have mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey i meant to followup earlier on the bending of the cost curve if you were to put different initiatives in terms of how far along you are maybe like your exits might be in the 8th inning and your transformation might be in the 6th inning and your remediation in the 5th inning and the simplification in the 1st inning or 2nd inning are those numbers correct how would you put those numbers in terms of bending the cost curve where are you further along and where are you just getting started mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc well mike i love you but im not going to play that game what i will say is that we clearly have work that were doing as it relates to the exits but were making very good progress on that not just on the closing of the exits but also on putting a dent in the stranded costs associated with those exits that we have closed and so as jane mentioned in her prepared remarks by the time we get to the end of the year exmexico we would have made a considerable amount of progress on there and that creates an opportunity to do more around the simplification of the organization and so that simplification is obviously in an earlier inning call it the exits in a later inning i think that the transformation spend investments and those things look we are squarely into execution as youve heard us mention before and as i have mentioned the expense base around that is going to continue to morph from spend that weve made around thirdparty consultants that helped into crafting of the plan towards technology towards people that are critically involved in the execution of it and then a downward trajectory towards the benefits we get from that technology in reduced operational expense and so its a multiyear journey weve talked about that weve got a number of years to continue to execute against it but whats important is we know what we have to do both in how were investing that money and as it relates to being disciplined about our cost structure and bending the curve and again thats what were going to do mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and one more attempt can you remind us how many people are working on the transformation remediation and how much thats costing you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i mean again weve got i think the number i shared was somewhere around people or so that are broadly working on the efforts here we havent gotten into specific costs its in the total number but what i would say again is that were clear on what weve got to deliver and execute against and were managing that cost very tightly were constantly looking at opportunities to deliver on those transformation deliverables more efficiently leveraging more technology leveraging ai in some instances and so were not just taking those execution plans as they were crafted and delivering against them but were looking for efficiencies and even the execution plans as they are constructed today and thats important for us to keep doing operator and our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey i know this is going long here just quick one just mark on i just want to get your sense on the sentiment around client activity in both the markets group and what the pipelines are looking like in investment banking and the feel for that thanks jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc look ill jump in here corporates are pretty cautious theyve got another fed hike in the offing tensions in china and the west opec and oil a general sense of more limited growth but i think clients have been trying to understand and get their arms around both the macro and the market outlook for a while i think they now seem to accept the current environment is the new normal and are beginning to position themselves globally so globally were seeing less anxiety around funding as most large corps are biting the bullet and paying higher rates to take advantage of issuance windows balance sheets getting reinforced we certainly dont see a large cap credit crisis on the horizon and on the ib side it remains the pipeline is robust theres a lot of pentup demand for ma but its hard to predict when that pipeline will unlock ecm had tangible momentum over  and were also seeing sponsor indiscernible showing signs of improvement but both of those are from a very very low base and on the investor side most of the investors stayed on the sidelines in  the debt ceiling was a bigger topic than economic news was and then it was a very low volume environment we saw a bit of pickup at the beginning with the light bump in volatility the last few days but i wouldnt call that a trend yet ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks jane operator and our next question comes from charles peabody with portales charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut yes good afternoon i have a question about your markets related net interest income and before i ask the question i do appreciate that you run those businesses on a holistic basis and that nii is probably more of a residual outcome but a couple of questions related to markets related to nii first is you had a pretty nice jump up in the second quarter versus the first quarter and i just wanted to understand is that largely related to seasonal dividend issues and then secondly you have a positive nii outcome where a lot of your money center brethren will have a negative nii outcome for markets and im just wondering what the difference is is it the outsized ficc business relative to equities or is it international or is it how you hedge whats the difference on that so those are the two questions mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 thanks for the question and thanks for the acknowledgment that we do manage our markets revenues in total so i appreciate that what i would say in terms of the markets nii is youve captured it right which is the dynamic thats playing out between first quarter and second quarter is in fact dividend season and again given the globality of our franchise the dividend is not just a dividend in any one region but dividend in multiple regions playing out over the course of the first and second quarter i cant speak to the peers at this particular stage but what i would say is that you know that our book skews more so than peers to corporates and thats important and we obviously have a very very strong ficc business more broadly as well so dividend season a major driver here in that increase charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut okay and just as a followup is there any sort of directional guidance you can give on markets related to nii i mean does it i mean to the extent second quarter was bolstered by dividends it comes down in the third quarter but then does it go back up in the fourth quarter so would the secondhalf be kind of equivalent to the firsthalf mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc charles i really appreciate the attempt there but im not going to give any further guidance on the breakout of the nii i will reiterate the exmarkets nii increase by the way to plus billion but thanks for the question i appreciate that operator and our next question comes from vivek juneja with jpmorgan jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks couple of questions number one so capital jane and mark going back to that should we expect that given what you have mentioned given everything going on in the regulatory environment that the ratio youre at currently it should grow in anticipation of what may come or likely to come with all the regulatory stuff or are you going to try and keep that closer to the jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc i think were going to see exactly what the framework is that comes out on that and then the implementation timeframe for it and then look at making adjustments to the plan also hoping that the comment period is taken seriously and the different considerations i talked about earlier are taken into effect then well work through what are adjustments we make pricing capital reallocations et cetera the playbook that you would expect the same one that weve done with indiscernible and weve done with a number of other pieces and we would also hope to see our scb in a different place for the same reasons we talked about earlier vivek because theres citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 a lot of volatility in that scb dependent on the scenario that comes out every year and i would say given the shifts were making in the business model wed expect to see that one come down mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc the only thing id add is again the cet1 ratio of the as of october would be a regrequired level and basis points of the management buffer so that would be what wed be held to as of october as jane mentioned the npr as it comes out well take a look at that and see if there are implications on the cet1 stack but more likely implications on the riskweighted assets jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc and whats really important there aside from the very important points jane made in terms of it considering broader factors is the timing of the implementation of whatever that final rule includes and obviously the more timing for implementation the more of an ability it gets for the industry to think about how to absorb the implications there vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right but im presuming youd want to go sooner rather than later because the markets going to expect that rather than take a full three years or whatever the fed might give you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah you know what im really interested at this point in seeing proposal and then well have a chance to kind of really react as an industry and as a firm vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc completely unrelated if i may noninterestbearing deposits what are you seeing given youre very heavily corporatedriven when i look at your pointtopoint because you dont give a full average balance sheet its only interestbearing related but the noninterestbearing is only available on a periodend when i look at that there was a big drop in the us this quarter anything unusual is that accelerating what are you seeing amongst your clients are people still waking up and what have you factored into your nii guidance for that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc well again i think the point id make here is that we continue to see clients shift from kind of noninterestbearing deposits and into both interestbearing and cds and other higheryielding products in light of the rate environment that were in and i would expect us to continue to see those types of shifts subject to how rates continue to evolve and again on the corporate side weve seen in the us clients have reached kind of those terminal that citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14jul2023 terminal level terminal betas i should say outside of the us rate hikes i think are still in the future as jane alluded to and the terminal betas have not quite yet been reached but in terms of the noninterestbearing we are seeing that dynamic play out operator thank you this does conclude
