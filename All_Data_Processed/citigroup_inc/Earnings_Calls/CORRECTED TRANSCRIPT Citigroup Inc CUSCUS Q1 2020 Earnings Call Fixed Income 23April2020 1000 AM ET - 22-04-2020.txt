the risk factors section of our form 10k with that said let me turn it over to mike michael verdeschi treasurer citigroup inc thank you tom and good morning everyone on todays call i will cover a number of topics first ill briefly discuss our operating results for the first quarter second i will cover recent balance sheet trends including growth in loans and deposits third ill review our issuance program and finally ill discuss our continued strong liquidity and capital position slide summarizes our results for the first quarter in the first quarter we reported net income of billion which included a billion increase in credit reserves reflecting the impact of changes in our economic outlook due to covid19 these builds reflected the significant impact these changes in our economic outlook have had on our estimated lifetime losses under the new cecl standards on slide we show average balance sheet trends over the past five quarters in constant dollars on this basis we have grown our balance sheet by approximately over the last year as we supported both our consumer and institutional clients through the uncertainty caused by the covid19 health crisis while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet we grew deposits across our consumer and institutional businesses we saw strong growth in both icg and gcb loans tradingrelated assets and liabilities grew as a result of increased client activity in light of the heightened market volatility we saw in the quarter and longterm debt increased as we prudently built liquidity to support our clients and maintain the firms strong liquidity profile as much of the growth that we saw this quarter took place in march these trends are even more pronounced on an endofperiod basis for reference weve added a summary endofperiod balance sheet on page of the appendix of this presentation slide presents trends in our loan portfolio on an average basis in constant dollars total citigroup loans increased yearoveryear and in aggregate across our consumer and institutional businesses in our consumer franchise average loans grew yearoveryear with growth across region in our institutional franchise average loans also grew yearoveryear driven by the private bank loans in corporate lending were unchanged on an average basis but grew on an endofperiod basis reflecting drawdowns and new facilities as our clients built liquidity in response to the crisis and loans included in corpother continued to decline driven by the winddown of legacy assets on slide we show credit quality trends in our gcb and icg loan portfolios in gcb our credit trends show the seasonality we typically see in the first quarter in icg nonaccrual loans increased sequentially but remained low at basis points of total corporate loans citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 23apr2020 turning to slide we show trends in average deposits over the past five quarters in constant dollars total deposits increased from the prioryear period in our consumer business deposit growth accelerated to driven by strong growth across all regions in north america strong deposit growth of reflected digital deposit sales as well as good engagement with existing clients in our institutional business deposits grew on an average basis and on an endof period basis primarily driven by strong deposit inflows in tts and securities services from both corporate and investor clients particularly in march now let me cover our parent benchmark debt issuance program on slide so far this year we have issued approximately billion of parent level benchmark debt across a variety of tenors including our issuance earlier this month going forward well continue to maintain the flexibility to issue a mix of tenors currency and structures as we prudently manage the liquidity profile of the firm and continue to support our clients on slide let me cover our issuance maturity and redemption expectation in we continue to expect a gross issuance of approximately billion in aggregate across our parent benchmark and bank level programs including the roughly billion weve issued so far this year and while we will maintain the flexibility to issue out of both the parent and the bank at this point we expect our issuance to be more weighted towards the parent given the strong deposit growth weve seen at the bank and we will continue to be flexible around optimizing our funding through opportunistic redemption on slide we show the composition of our longterm debt outstanding during the first quarter our total long term debt increased by approximately billion to billion driven by fhlb borrowings in the bank as well as the parent benchmark debt issuance i mentioned earlier in order to build liquidity to meet our clients needs on slide we provide an update of our lcr metrics and drivers our average lcr remained flat at this quarter turning to slide let me summarize our key regulatory capital metrics our cet1 capital ratio declined to driven primarily by an increase in riskweighted assets as we supported our corporate and investor clients and their slrs were and for citigroup and citibank respectively moving to our last slide let me summarize several key points we earned billion of net income including a billion increase in credit reserves we maintained a strong capital position with a cet1 capital ratio of and slr of and a surplus above our tlac requirement and we also maintained a strong liquidity position with an average lcr of billion of available liquidity resources and we expect to be in compliance with the nsfr when the rule is effective before we move on to qa let me touch briefly on the transition away from libor broadly speaking we are continuing to prepare ourselves for the transition by working with our regulators and various industry working groups as well as through the work streams weve established within citi we are monitoring the adoption of the various new riskfree rates including the market for sofr which has continued to develop with regard to the unique language in the subset of our preferred securities while we are continuing to make progress in evaluating alternatives we are not yet in the position to speak to a specific transaction or timing and with that mark and i will be happy to answer your question citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 23apr2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of hima inguva with bank of america hima b inguva q analyst bank of america merrill lynch great thank you for doing the call and i hope that youre all well and families are well and everyone is staying safe mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you hima michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc thank you hima hima b inguva q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you i am going to ask two questions the first one is regarding prefs considering there will be no common stock buybacks how should we think about your pref issuance or redemptions this year any color you could provide would be helpful michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure hima yeah i would think about the prefs similar to how weve discussed them in the past if you go back we typically were running a little bit over the stated target of basis points of at1 you can see now with the growth of rwa where were running a little bit under that target and so when we look at the prefs and as we have calls coming due similar to what ive said in the past well evaluate our need for that capital and if we dont need it we may call and not replace but if we want to keep that capital outstanding well evaluate the economics associated with calling and replacing versus leaving that outstanding so i think the only change of course is that were running slightly short of that target but not by a meaningful amount so well keep an eye on that and obviously as weve said before well remain opportunistic and see how the balance sheet evolves from here hima b inguva q analyst bank of america merrill lynch great so just a followup on that so the current environment just philosophically speaking does not change the way you think about prefs is that a fair statement michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 23apr2020 yeah i mean well continue to evaluate i think in this current environment how our balance sheet will likely evolve and we want to make sure were maintaining a robust level of capital and liquidity and be in a position to serve our clients so thats where our focus will be and again well be evaluating our needs for that capital and liquidity levels so as weve done even on the liquidity side over the quarter weve accessed the market opportunistically and well be doing the same across our programs operator your next question is from the line of scott cavanagh with apg scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc good morning guys thanks for the call mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning scott scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc two questions for you first on your energy exposure i very much appreciate you reintroducing that disclosure could you discuss what youre doing with the commodity prices at such a low price or negative for your reserve based lending and then secondly looking at the credit cards can you go through the interplay with your retail partners and what volumes youre seeing subsequent to quarterend and i do appreciate you breaking out the reserves for both retail and branded mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure scott thank you for joining and thanks for the question why dont i take you back to slide and just give you a little bit of a sense for what weve disclosed here between and so that you know what we have here obviously this is a sector thats been under a considerable amount of pressure for certainly through the quarter weve got about as you can see about billion in quarter one of funded and unfunded exposure here about of that is investment grade and about of the unfunded is investment grade you can see there is a concentration for us in north america and the uk the sectors been moving very rapidly through the crisis weve seen clients reduce capex weve seen them reduce and eliminate the dividend payouts in some instances weve seen them access alternative sources of liquidity when i look at our billion you can see here about billion of that is funded exposure weve obviously been supporting our largest and most creditworthy energy clients given the pricing pressure that you referenced from an oil point of view and then well continue to do that were intensely focused on that citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 23apr2020 we did build reserves in the quarter against the energy sector we currently sit at about in terms of a funded reserve ratio if you break that out for the noninvestment grade the noninvestment grade reserve ratio is about so we are obviously a bit more reserved against that as i think you would expect but overall the exposure in the sector is i would say manageable and within certainly within our risk framework appetite and limits but this continues to evolve we continue to manage it closely and tightly and we break out more detail on the unfunded exposure on the next page i wont drag you through that i think theres a fair amount of detail there to give you a sense for how were managing through that but as you suggested and as is the case there is pressure on the sector but we are managing it actively and closely in terms of your second question which was with regard to the cards portfolio ill make a couple comments on that one i mentioned on the earnings call that we saw significant pressure in the way of purchase sales across many of the categories in cards spend activity on many of the categories there down as much as in the backend of the month of march that continues to be about what were seeing about down to year overyear it has flattened a bit relative to the last week of march but it continues to be down to the tune of that level what i would highlight is that we obviously have of our card exposure concentrated in our two us portfolios so the branded portfolio as well as our retail services portfolio and its important to kind of really understand and think about the credit profile and how thats evolved over the past number of years and certainly since the last crisis and a couple of quick data points in our branded cards portfolio over of our portfolio today is with customers with a fico score thats greater than and when we look back to the period of time where we were heading into the last crisis that was less than and on the lower end less than today is with customers with a fico score thats less than versus the precrisis levels where of the last crisis where it was nearly back then so theres been a significant change in the profile of the customer that we have in the branded portfolio a greater proportion of the customers are transactor customers and so we think that speaks to obviously the quality thats there weve been disciplined around our line exposures so we have less than of the open to buy to customers are with fico scores of less than and so again very focused on the high end in terms of retail services and you asked about that specifically a couple things to keep in mind there one is that weve been very focused on working with our partners to support them as they manage through this crisis and advising them as clients and that includes how we can help them drive sales digitally obviously the shutdown is impacting most of the economy particularly when you have stayathome orders but that said we continue to work closely with clients in that regard its also important to keep in mind that the nature of these relationships that we have these partnerships that we have are such that we share in the losses so to speak when and if they do materialize and so while we end up carrying the full reserve against that portfolio ultimately theres a loss sharing that happens that flows through our revenue line in terms of the credit quality and its important to speak to that on this portfolio as well over of the portfolio here is with customers with fico scores greater than and back before the last crisis that was about a third citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 23apr2020 and again on the lowerend tier only about of our loans are with customers that have a fico of less than and that was about a third going into the last crisis so i just wanted to kind of share some of those metrics to give you a sense for how the portfolios have evolved going into this crisis but obviously we continue to manage it very very closely and thats kind of where that stands at this stage operator your next question is from the line of kevin maloney with blackrock kevin james maloney q analyst blackrock advisors llc thanks for taking my question mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hi kevin kevin james maloney q analyst blackrock advisors llc just wondering if you could talk about your forbearance programs particularly deferral on credit cards both in the united states and what youre doing in mexico as well as hong kong mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure let me just give you i guess a broad sense we obviously have forbearance activities around the world in markets that we serve our customers in youve heard me mention on the earnings call that our primary focus has been first our employees and then ensuring that our customers and clients have what they need from a service point of view and that certainly includes many of the forbearance efforts and relief efforts that are out there locally in some of the other countries where we have a presence we obviously do that in adherence with the regulatory and government guidelines there specifically in the us we have fee refunds around atm withdrawals around monthly servicing fees we have put in place card payment deferrals and fee waivers for up to two cycles on the mortgage side weve extended treatment options for payment deferrals there weve suspended foreclosures for days we have a 90day forbearance due to hardship and just to give you a couple of stats we put out about million waivers since april to our customers across the cards and retail businesses that we have so at the same time were watching the impact of the trillion relief stimulus thats been put out there that obviously we have to see what impact that has and how that plays through to our end customers but were doing a lot as it relates to these types of forbearance activities to ensure that were taking care of our customers whove been impacted kevin james maloney q analyst blackrock advisors llc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 23apr2020 thanks and does the customer have to come to you or are you actively going after customers that maybe are on some sort of a watch list mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc customers are coming to us by and large and were obviously responding to their needs as they arise operator your next question is from the line of brian monteleone with barclays brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital securities ltd hey good morning thanks for all the incredible information about mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning brian brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital securities ltd hey good morning can you talk a little bit about kind of the path of the takeup of a lot of the forbearance programs that have been offered to customers kind of has it peaked and tailed off does it differ by customer type can you share some incremental thoughts there mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah well look i mean one thing i should point out is that i think our regulators have been very very proactive in terms of these types of programs and really trying to get them off the ground to address the many different client segments customer segments that are out there everything from the large corporate clients to small businesses to the consumers and theyve gone as far as you know with the ppp program for example and ensuring that there is no kind of drag from a riskweighting point of view as banks operate to help facilitate getting access to the very important small business segment programs have been unoperational in varied timelines sotospeak and so for example the small business ppp program was stood up very quickly and in our case this is an important but not a very large segment for us but we moved as quickly as we could to set up the digital access capabilities so that our customers the customers that we do have in this segment could get access to that quickly and as you would have seen across the industry that was used up very quickly and theres now discussions around yet another program focused on that very important segment so it has varied in terms of the different programs and the speed at which its ramped up it also varies just depending on the customers and how theyre impacted so some were impacted very early on if you think about different parts of the us and the staggered shutdown if you will but as i mentioned were kind of at a place now where at least in the consumer side in the us weve got about million waivers that we put out there and are running at somewhat of a steady volume i would say but hopefully that gives you a bit of a sense citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 23apr2020 brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thank you sorry when you say steady volume like steady volume of increases in applications for forbearance on the consumer side or its kind of plateaued at that level and just remaining steady mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i dont have that in front of me i cant really say that its ramping up i dont have that in front of me brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital securities ltd got it okay and then is there any areas of the portfolio where you guys are trying to kind of rein in risk whether thats reducing credit limits to some credit card customers or anything else thats going on in terms of kind of reducing risk of the portfolio mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc look i mean these are obviously unprecedented times in many ways but we are we continue to be focused broadly across the entire portfolio there are obviously corporate sectors that early on were impacted more than others i took everyone on the line here through a little bit on the energy side and we continue to kind of manage that youve heard me reference a bit of the open to buy on the cards side we obviously watch that very closely and so there arent particular sectors that i would point to i mean but in this type of environment in crisis were watching all of it very very closely but again we feel this is where it matters in terms of your target market and the segments that youve decided to focus on and we feel good about that and thats not to say there wont be losses but that is to say that well be able to manage through operator your next question is from the line of mark kehoe with mackay shields mark kehoe q analyst mackay shields llc hey good morning i had two questions the first one is would you mind talking about how you are positioning yourselves within the securities portfolio and given kind of interchangeable sorry guidance around interchangeability of reserves in treasuries and whether you are taking advantage of dislocations in the mbs market and then i have a followup question thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hi mark yeah thanks for the question so i think our strategy around the portfolio has somewhat continued over the past year we have been allocating to agency mbs but more recently we added to us treasuries and even foreign sovereigns as well and thats been a function of putting money to work as well as reducing the overall rate sensitivity but youre right youre asking about the agency mbs and theres been a few areas of focus there i mean for one i often talk about buying product that is call protected or has less negative convexity associated with it and citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 23apr2020 so that makes up a good portion of our strategy in the agency mbs book but we would also hold more generic collateral in current production and with the fed coming back in with qe and including mortgages we saw those generics richen up quite a bit relative to that callprotected collateral so what you would normally see us do is optimizing within that portfolio and optimizing across the hqla that we hold but yes you have seen us put money to work and were certainly now also focused on relative value within that mortgage portfolio given how some parts have richened up given the feds actions mark kehoe q analyst mackay shields llc great thank you and my last question with just in terms of back to the deferral questions how do you remain topofwallet and kind of make sure that customers sort of sees you not as their preferred bank to defer on is that more increasing rewards increasing advertising so that they dont go to you for their first request for deferral and they may go to peers and keep paying bills on their citi card thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look i mean again we are when i think about our client focus as you heard me talk about some of those stats we focus on the higher end in terms of the risk profile we obviously have both the branded and the retail services cards and we do feel good about our wallet position which tends to be strong with that said we continue to kind of manage that actively and where there are rewards in place we continue to offer that even through this environment but a lot of this is really going to be yet to have been seen soto speak so a lot of this is on the come in terms of how consumers are ultimately impacted and what it means in the way of the stimulus and what theyre able to continue to do in the way of managing their expenses and households and what it ultimately means in the way of unemployment and a lot of that is still unknown and until theres greater clarity on how those things all work together its going to be hard to speak to what the ultimate impact will be but our role as you would imagine is to continue to support those customers and thats what weve been doing and in the broader sense to continue to help to be there for all of our clients corporates and consumers as we try to play our role in stabilizing the economy as we all manage through this operator your next question is from the line of david jiang with pgim mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hi david good morning david jiang q analyst pgim inc hi good morning quick question for you mark just with the lcr kind of flat around just trying to figure out the dynamics of kind of all the draws that you had corporate draws and how kind of that ratio did not move down from the outflow side mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 23apr2020 mike do you want to start on that michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc yeah sure hi david its mike david jiang q analyst pgim inc hey mike michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc so that top of the house measure as you say was flat on the quarter but keep in mind thats ticking up and the way the lcr methodology works its picking up that top of the house view of liquidity whereas keep in mind in the bank where you see that deposit inflow as well as lending activity thats going to be at the bank level so while we did see draws of course we had enormous deposit inflow which was of course more than enough to cover those draws that we saw but its really just a function of that lcr methodology at the top of the house but to answer your question its more about the methodology but overall liquidity as you can imagine remains robust as i talked about that deposit inflow we saw it early in the quarter it continued throughout the quarter and obviously we put some of that money to work in terms of the lending much more of it was put in cash and in a way it served to fund the needs in the first quarter but would also serves as prefunding for future needs as well mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc the only thing id add to that is we have seen as mike suggested we have seen the draws kind of slow a bit particularly in light of how the markets have opened up and given our client segment having other alternatives to shore up their liquidity that said the deposits have continued at a nice pace david jiang q analyst pgim inc great thanks so a followup question for mark can you just talk about how you think about your regulatory buffers and your operating buffers currently given that i think cet1 is and thats slightly below your operating target and how you think about the regulatory minimum at or is it plus the scb impact and how comfortable are you into kind of piercing that regulatory minimum mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure look id start again with we are trying to manage through a crisis and focus keenly on really trying to be there to support our clients and play a broader role in trying to stabilize the economy and we come into this crisis from a i think a position of strength when you look across the balance sheet and where we ended the year with the cet1 ratio with lcr and even as we ended the quarter youre right its below the target that i talked about of but that reflects additional draw as clients move to shore up their own liquidity it reflects new facilities as clients try to manage through this crisis it reflects the impact of cecl playing citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 23apr2020 through the numerator and so there are a lot of important things that are flowing through that that get us to that look the is still basis points above the reg minimum and so there is still capacity there to support our clients which is important and well use that capacity as needed to do so and frankly with those primary objectives if we needed to utilize or play through the buffer sotospeak then we would obviously want to be thoughtful about that we want to be comprehensive in how weve assessed our entire balance sheet and all of our exposures but if thats what was called for in order to support our clients and help stabilize things then we would do that and frankly i think thats what some of the measures that the regulators have put out there are designed to ensure that we and other players in the industry can act in a way that helps to stabilize things operator your next question is from the line of ryan butkus with lord abbett ryan butkus q analyst lord abbett co llc thank you again for hosting the call mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hey ryan ryan butkus q analyst lord abbett co llc just had a question on slide hi on slide with the temporary relief for the supplementary leverage ratio i was curious to see how you would think about this on a pro forma basis for the first quarter and what does that extra added relief allow you to do and then lastly not just on the slr but for the covid19 regulatory capital relief categories on slide do you foresee any of these sort of being applied as part of the stress testing ccar process as well michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc mark maybe ill take that first one yeah i mean for the slr of course thats not been an area of a binding constraint and we think obviously the regulators are trying to do everything they can with programs and some relief to support markets and the broader economy for us obviously we hold a good amount of cash at the federal reserve as well as us treasuries and so if you look at that slr its probably an impact of roughly basis points so its a meaningful amount but then again an area where weve not necessarily been constrained so it doesnt really change how weve been operating and managing that balance sheet mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah in terms of ccar this is obviously in many ways a unique year in terms of the ccar process one because of obviously the crisis the covid19 that were managing through two because of the scb final ruling thats out and how that changes the process three in some regards when you just look at just cecl and the transition as well as the day and what that means for the cet1 ratio so a lot of moving pieces there citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 23apr2020 while we havent been given specific guidance i think our regulators have made it clear that they are going to be looking towards how banks are managing through this crisis and so while there is scenarios that are out there that weve run and weve made a submission around the ccar capital planning what we suspect will be critically important is the daytoday managing of this crisis and our ability to do so as a firm and thats what were focused on and again while there hasnt been specific guidance out i suspect that is what the fed and our regulators probably will be focused on ryan butkus q analyst lord abbett co llc okay thank you and then just given the global exposure id be curious on korea as theyve sort of progressed to another portion of this current crisis but there seems to be more on the other side is there any interesting activity that youve been seeing in korea compared to within the crisis that you could share with us mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc look this has varied in terms of its not only the impact but the impact and reaction from countrytocountry and in many instances from statetostate and obviously started early in asia and different countries within the region reacted differently and theyre at different phases of hopefully coming out of it weve got people working remotely around the globe and that certainly is still the case in parts of asia mike spoke to some of that and i dont have specifics on korea as it compares to some of the other countries but those local market conditions more broadly in asia are evolving and at this point we have branch closures kind of broadly across asia that are still at about or so which is lower than other parts of the other regions around the world operator your next question is from the line of arnold kakuda with bloomberg intelligence arnold shoichi kakuda q analyst bloomberg lp research hi good morning so  has seen a surge in balance sheet growth from deposit inflow and a lot of that seems to be sitting in liquid assets and it sounds like the nearterm trend is just for that to continue but when do you expect things to change in terms of either the balance sheet contracting or do you see kind of loan growth picking up like what is your kind of mid to nearterm view on that michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc yeah maybe ill start with that i mean look i think with the federal reserve adding a lot of liquidity to the system via quantitative easing of course they expanded their balance sheet by call it trillion over the past few months and theyve thats resulted in added reserves in the system of another call it trillion and deposits then in the industry are up call it trillion so obviously that action by the fed is going to increase deposits for us as well and again we feel good about that deposit growth especially in consumer where weve seen that good trend continue of attracting deposits through some of our digital strategies but also weve seen a continuation of very good deposit growth in our icg and especially in our tts business citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 23apr2020 and so that deposit flow i would expect to continue weve even seen that inflow continue so far in this month as well and we do think thats going to be both a function of the feds actions but also our ability to attract flows both based on our consumer strategy but also was a bit of flight to quality and the continued momentum in tts and so as we evaluate that as i said we put some of that to work in lending and some of that will go into cash and securities to warehouse that liquidity and to use in the future as mark mentioned too we saw loan draws in the first quarter wed begin to see that slow in the second quarter as our clients have been going back to the markets that they normally would raise funding in and thats going to be in the capital markets be it term issuance or in commercial paper and so weve seen that slow but the evolution of the balance sheet is going to be very much a function of fed actions but also our customer needs and hopefully that gives you a little bit of color of some of the things playing out and mark anything you want to add to that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i mean id make a broader comment which is again this is an unprecedented crisis right and so to be able to predict exactly when this turns and the like i think is certainly going to be challenging to do we have to remember that this started as a health crisis and has obviously evolved to a global economic crisis but at the root of that there has to be a solution some resolution around the health concerns that are there i think that the things that are being done to support the broader economy the monetary actions the fiscal actions are helpful but until the root of the problem is addressed theyre simply going to be bridging the economy soto speak and we are as i mentioned earlier seeing areas where things are picking up a bit and we talked about asia we are seeing signs of pickup in china specifically there are early signs of pickup in korea as well but not enough to move the needle and theres still a fair amount of uncertainty thats out there and so as mike suggest and as i mentioned earlier we are seeing the draws kind of taper a bit but we want to be there for our clients and if that means that it evolves to those picking up or it means that were helping clients access other forms of liquidity or it simply means that were the holder of flight to quality that clients and customers think is important then well continue to do that arnold shoichi kakuda q analyst bloomberg lp research okay great and then as a followup be there for clients you had almost billion increase in the balance sheet how much do you think of that is gaining share potentially from a peer that is under fed orders that you cannot grow mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look id say that we are broadly gaining share across many of our businesses which is a its a good thing its hard to say specifically where thats coming from particularly in an environment like this where there are so many different pressures that come into play but again we are gaining share its just hard to point to any one player we wouldnt want to speak to that citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 23apr2020 operator operator
