citigroup inc thank you operator good morning and thank you all for joining us id like to remind you that todays presentation which is available for download on our website citigroupcom may contain forwardlooking statements which are based on managements current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our sec filings with that ill turn it over to jane jane nind fraser chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you jen and thanks everyone for joining us today well we are certainly still living through interesting times and overall i am pleased with how our bank is navigating through them as youll hear from me shortly we continue to focus intensely on executing our strategy and our transformation as we outlined at investor day whilst supporting our clients in this complex environment so before i get into the quarter let me highlight some observations about what we see going on around the world given our unique vantage point the global macro outlook that we shared with you over the last couple of quarters has been borne out there is accumulating evidence of slowing global growth and we now expect to experience rolling countrylevel recessions starting this quarter the severity and timing of these recessions depend where in the world you are although persistently high inflation is driving a global softening of consumer demand for goods in the eurozone and the uk the supply shocks are most severe growth prospects have deteriorated sharply and headline inflation is running at nearly all eyes are on this winters weather forecast and the energy supply the us economy however remains relatively resilient so while we are seeing signs of economic slowing consumers and corporates remain healthy as our very low net credit losses demonstrate supply chain constraints are easing the labor market remains strong so it is all a question of what it takes to truly tame persistently high core inflation now history would suggest that that will be quite a lot and for some time therefore we could well see a mild recession in the second half of we believe the us economy is wellpositioned to withstand it all else being equal in the geopolitical arena that is citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 finally in asia we continue to be concerned with chinas covid lockdowns which took a bigger bite out of economic activity than anticipated exacerbated by a lack of intensified macro stimulus it is geopolitical risks and rates that dominate discussions with our corporate clients worldwide and id say were more focused on market liquidity generally and counterparty risk than our credit risk in the nearterm nonetheless we are planning conservatively and we are prepared for all environments against this backdrop today we reported net income of billion eps of and an rotce of we grew revenues by including a gain on sale of our consumer business in the philippines while we had excellent performance in some areas our results could have been better in a few others services delivered another very strong quarter tts saw revenues up year over year with growth in each business and in fees key drivers of our strategy such as wallet share trade loan originations and cross border transactions are all trending strongly in the right direction and are ahead of our plan securities services was up despite assets under custody being impacted by the declines in equity markets we have onboarded over trillion in auc and aua since the beginning of the year and were seeing good momentum in issuer services in particular markets on the other hand came in lower with revenues down in fixed income we matched last years particularly good showing through our longstanding strength in fx offsetting a weaker quarter in spread products in equities reduced activity in derivatives which is a core part of our platform led to lower revenues compared to last years exceptional performance and we continued to optimize rwa in markets consistent with our strategy banking was a business most adversely impacted by the macro environment across the industry with geopolitics and fears of recession significantly reducing deal flows and the appetite for ma we continue to invest in building out our team for longterm growth opportunities including healthcare technology and energy and im really pleased with the high caliber of bankers who are attracted to both our platform and our culture the environment for wealth management continued to be less than ideal our revenues were down only slightly and meaningfully up outside of asia our strategy to capture the synergies of our businesses such as the wealth referral initiatives between commercial banking retail banking and investment banking is progressing well we also continued to steadily attract new clients and increase the ranks of our client advisors as youll see in our kpis nonetheless we are slowing the pace of some of the investments in this business given the environment us personal banking further solidified its growth trajectory card sales ar interestearning balances and customer acquisition all saw good growth and we continued to increase digital uptake retail services joined branded cards in having doubledigit revenue growth this quarter retail banking also grew contributing to a overall revenue increase for the business as you can see in the presentation our cost of credit reflects the quality of our loan portfolio in both icg and pbwm there were effectively no credit losses in icg and us consumer ncls remain well below the precovid levels consumer loan growth together with a worsening of our macroeconomic assumptions drove a modest acl build this quarter citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 while our expenses are elevated as we continue to invest in our businesses and in our transformation we are managing them closely and we remain on track to meet the fullyear guidance as you know the transformation is a multiyear effort and were committed to meeting the expectations of our regulators given the paramount importance of safety and soundness we continue to be in constructive dialogues with them and are updating our execution plans as appropriate stepping back im generally pleased with the advances were making in the key drivers of the strategy we laid out for you in march and these are laid out on page were seeing good momentum in realizing client synergies and in attracting talent to grow the franchise in terms of simplification we continue to make progress on the divestitures of our international consumer businesses and the elimination of their associated stranded costs we closed the sale of the philippines during the third quarter and are on track to close bahrain malaysia and thailand during the fourth quarter we also announced the winddown of our consumer franchise in the uk to focus fully on the wealth franchise there i would also note were ahead of our plan in our korean consumer wind down we continue to shrink our operations in and exposure to russia to be clear our intention is to wind down our presence in that country in august we announced the winddown of our consumer and local commercial banking businesses while we have been supporting our multinational clients in russia we are now informing them that we will be ending nearly all of the institutional banking services we offer by the end of the first quarter of next year at that point our only operations in russia will be those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory obligations turning to capital we returned billion to our shareholders through common dividends during the quarter while buybacks continued to be on hold we will keep evaluating that decision on a quarterly basis as due to increasing regulatory requirements we build our cet1 ratio to or so by midnext year and that includes a management buffer of basis points we ended the quarter at a cet1 ratio of as we actively managed our rwa usage throughout our lines of business lastly our tangible book value per share increased to so the bottom line is that while the environment is a challenging one and we expect it will remain so we continue to focus relentlessly on executing the strategy we presented to you at our investor day and on make steady progress now id like to turn it over to mark and then wed be delighted as always to take your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you jane and good morning everyone im going to start with the firmwide financial results focusing on yearoveryear comparisons for the third quarter unless i indicate otherwise and spend a little more time on expenses credit and capital then i will turn to the results of each segment and end with fullyear guidance on slide we show financial results for the full firm in the third quarter we reported net income of billion and eps of with an rotce of on billion of revenues embedded in these results are pretax divestiturerelated impacts of approximately million largely driven by a gain on the sale of the philippines consumer business excluding divestiturerelated impacts eps and rotce would have been and respectively citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 in the quarter total revenues increased on a reported basis excluding divestiturerelated impacts revenues were down as growth in net interest income was more than offset by lower noninterest revenues net interest income grew driven by the impact of higher interest rates across the firm and strong loan growth in pbwm noninterest revenues were down on a reported basis and excluding divestiturerelated impacts largely reflecting declines in investment banking markets and investment revenues in wealth total expenses of billion increased and excluding divestiturerelated impacts largely driven by transformation inflation and other risk and control initiatives cost of credit was billion driven by net credit losses of approximately million and an acl build of approximately million primarily driven by loan growth in pbwm at the end of the quarter we had billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately on slide we show net interest income loans and deposits in the third quarter total net interest income increased by approximately million on a sequential basis and approximately billion on a yearoveryear basis across the firm driven by higher interest rates management of deposit repricing and loan growth in pbwm average loans were down by approximately largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower balances in legacy franchises excluding fx loans were largely flat and average deposits were down by approximately largely driven by declines in legacy franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation partially offset by the issuance of institutional cds as we continue to diversify the funding profile of the bank excluding fx deposits were up roughly and sequentially our net interest margin increased by basis points on slide we show an expense walk for the third quarter with the key underlying drivers as i mentioned earlier expenses increased by and excluding the impact of divestitures of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about twothirds related to the risk control data and finance programs and approximately of the investments in those programs are related to technology as of today we have over people dedicated to the transformation about of the expense increase was driven by businessled investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisors in wealth and we continue to invest in the client experience as well as front office onboarding and platforms was due to higher volumerelated expenses across both pbwm and icg and approximately was driven by other risk and control investments and inflation partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation across all these buckets we continue to investment in technology including systems and hiring people resulting in our technologyrelated spend of approximately for the quarter on slide we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics over the last several years we have been disciplined with our loan growth and consistent with our risk appetite framework this framework includes credit risk limits that consider concentrations including country industry credit rating and in the case of consumer fico scores and importantly these limits apply across the firm in aggregate and we continuously analyze our citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 portfolios and concentrations under a range of stress scenarios as a result we feel very good about our asset quality and reserve levels as i mentioned earlier our reserves to funded loan ratio was approximately and within that pbwm and us cards is and respectively both right around day cecl levels in pbwm the majority of our card portfolios skew towards higher fico customers and while we have started to see signs of normalization in both portfolios ncl rates continue to be less than half of precovid levels in our icg portfolio of our total exposure over is investment grade and nonaccrual loans remain low and are in line with prepandemic levels at about basis points of total loans so we are well reserved for a variety of scenarios and we continuously evaluate our scenarios to reflect the evolving macro environment on slide we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics we maintained a very strong balance sheet of our trillion of assets about or billion are highquality liquid assets or hqla and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately billion the combination of earnings generation capital from exits and rwa optimization drove our cet1 ratio up by about basis points to approximately on a standardized basis which remains our binding constraint and our tangible book value per share was up from a year ago on slide we show a sequential cet1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our target over the next few quarters first we generated billion of net income to common which added basis points second we returned billion in the form of common dividends which drove a reduction of about basis points third the interest rate impact on aoci through our afs investment portfolio drove a 5basispoint reduction fourth changes in the dta drove a 3basispoint reduction and finally the remaining 14basispoint increase was largely driven by net rwa optimization in light of our increasing regulatory capital requirement we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio basis points higher than last quarter importantly is above our current regulatory requirement of as of october and above which will be our regulatory requirement as of january of next year as we said last quarter we continue to gradually build to a cet1 target of approximately by midyear which includes the current scb and a 100basispoint management buffer on slide we show the results for our institutional clients group revenues were down as strong growth in services was more than offset by lower revenues across markets and banking expenses increased driven by transformation businessled investments and volumerelated comments partially offset by productivity and foreign exchange translation cost of credit was driven by a reserve build of million while deterioration in certain macro variables did lead to a build it was mostly offset by the release of a covid19related uncertainty reserve and a release related to direct exposures in russia this resulted in net income of approximately billion down average loans were up driven by growth in tts loans partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation average deposits were down also largely driven by foreign exchange translation and icg delivered rotce of citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 on slide we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at investor day which we will show you each quarter in services we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue in treasury and trade solutions revenues were up driven by growth in net interest income as well as growth in nir across all client segments we continue to see healthy underlying drivers in tts that indicate consistently strong client activity with us dollar clearing volumes up crossborder flows up commercial card volumes up roughly and average loans up so while the rate environment drove about of the growth this quarter business actions drove the remaining this includes continuing to manage deposit repricing and deepening with existing clients and significant new client wins across all client segments through the first half of the year based on the industry data that we see we estimate that we gained over basis points of share with large corporate clients and client wins are up approximately across all segments including wins with financial institutions which are up almost these include marquee transactions where we are serving as the clients primary operating bank in addition so far this year we have onboarded approximately suppliers and we recently launched our innovative suite product in the us and asia which allows clients to connect their liquidity and funding to their operating flows seven days a week in securities services revenues grew as net interest income grew driven by higher interest rates across currencies partly offset by a decrease in noninterest revenue due to the impact of market valuation we continue to be pleased with the execution in securities services as we onboarded approximately trillion of assets under custody and administration so far this year from significant client wins and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals and we estimate that we have gained about basis points of share in securities services through the first half of this year including in our home market as a reminder the services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higherreturning businesses with strong linkages across the firm markets revenues were down largely driven by spread products equities and rwa actions as we continue to focus on returns fixed income markets revenues were up as strength in rates and fx was largely offset by continued headwinds in spread products and through the first half of the year we gained approximately basis points of share equity markets revenues were down primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives relative to a very strong quarter last year the actions we took to optimize rwa in markets are in line with the strategy we discussed at investor day and we are making solid progress on our revenue to rwa target so far this year and finally banking revenues excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were down driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity also embedded in the results is an impact of approximately million related to marks from loan commitments and losses on loan sales so overall while the market environment remains challenging we feel good about the progress we are making as we continue to deepen existing client relationships as well as acquire new clients citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 now turning to slide we show the results for our personal banking and wealth management business revenues were up as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue driven by lower investment fee revenue in wealth and higher partner payments in retail services expenses were up driven by transformation other risk and control initiatives businessled investments and volumedriven expenses partially offset by productivity savings cost of credit was billion which included a reserve build primarily driven by card volume growth ncls were higher yearoveryear from near historically low levels reflecting normalization particularly in retail services overall we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios average loans grew driven by strong growth across branded cards retail services and retail banking average deposits grew driven by growth across retail and wealth partially offset by foreign exchange translation and pbwm delivered an rotce of on slide we show pbwm revenues byproduct as well as key business drivers in metrics branded cards revenues were up driven by higher net interest income we continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up card spend volumes up and average loans up retail services revenues were up also driven by higher net interest income partially offset by higher partner payments so despite payment rates remaining elevated the investments weve been making contributed to growth in interestearning balances of in branded cards and in retail services and we expect to continue to grow these balances in the fourth quarter retail banking revenues were up primarily driven by interest rates and deposit growth wealth revenues were down as investment fee headwinds particularly in asia more than offset net interest income growth excluding asia revenues were up client advisors were up and were seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client acquisitions across our wealth business with new clients in ultrahigh net worth and wealth at work up and respectively for the quarter and were also leveraging our retail network which has driven almost wealth referrals so far this year while the environment continues to remain challenging we are seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy on slide we show results for legacy franchises revenues increased primarily driven by the philippines gain on sale in the quarter and the absence of the australia loss on sale in the prioryear period excluding these items revenues were down about largely due to the loss of revenues from the australia and philippines closings as well as the impact of the korea winddown expenses increased driven by divestiture impacts in asia and mexico loans and deposits decreased as a result of the reclassification of signed exits to other assets and other liabilities the closing of the philippines sale and the impact of the korea winddown on slide we show results for corporateother revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio partially offset by the marktomarket on certain derivative transactions and expenses were down citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 on slide ill briefly touch on our full year outlook with one quarter remaining in the year we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the lowsingledigit range excluding divestiturerelated impacts and within that we continue to see a shift with higher net interest income offset by lower noninterest revenue so for the fourth quarter we expect net interest income excluding markets to be up in the range of billion to billion year over year clearly where we land within that range will be a function of a number of factors including rates loans and deposit volumes deposit betas and currency impacts regarding full year expenses we continue to expect expenses to grow by to excluding divestiturerelated impacts in terms of cost of credit it will be a function of the evolution of the macro environment normalization that we continue to expect in the cards businesses and loan growth and keep in mind that loan growth tends to be higher in the fourth quarter versus the third given typical holiday spending before we move to qa id like to end with a few key points we continue to execute on the strategy that we laid out at investor day we are seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses and as we said at investor day the financial path will not be linear but we are confident we can achieve our mediumterm targets in a variety of scenarios and with that jane and i would be happy to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions thank you our first question will come from glenn schorr with evercore your line is now open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello thanks very much so definitely good performance out of tts rates help a ton but i see loan growth and fees and i heard your comments about growth across all client segments i wonder if we can pull back the onion peel back the onion a drop and talk about those two in separate pieces one is yearonyear nii how do betas factor in and go forward over the next year in terms of higher rates and how that factors through and then two what specifically is growing within tts across those client segments to drive that highsingledigit growth mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure good morning glenn why dont i take that and kind of take it in two pieces the two pieces that you laid out so as you know glenn when we think about our business just in aggregate theres obviously a split between the institutional and the consumer side our tts business which is on the institutional side and these corporate clients they tend to have higher betas in general than obviously the retail banking side what weve seen is that the betas have been increasing theyre still running lower than what we had expected but again they have been increasing and with continued expected rate increases i would expect that those betas will continue to rise in the coming quarters we have been actively managing beta deposit pricing and repricing with our clients on an ongoing basis citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 you know that this is more than just a deposittaking business this is a business where we are looking to manage the operating accounts of our clients and bring the breadth of what we offer in our franchise to them and so thats the type of conversation weve been having with them and well continue to do that with an eye towards growing the volume of deposits with both the existing as well as with new clients and so we again expect to see betas rise but also expect to see continued contribution to the nii the other aspect of your question is what else has been driving the activity i mentioned a couple of those things so its not just deepening with existing clients but its also onboarding new clients weve seen crossborder transaction value up about the commercial card spend is up meaningfully trade originations are up and so a lot of active engagement with our clients weve been winning new mandates weve seen an uptick in client wins up about and weve been gaining share across those client segments and so hopefully that gives you a little bit of examples of where the benefits or momentum is coming from on the nir side the nir growth of is driven really by the cards the payments and receivables as well as trade jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and id just jump in and say i think theres a bit of a myth at the moment that the global environment is detrimental to activity we see quite the opposite volatility is something in which were very active in helping our multinational clients around the world manage the local footprint we have and the global network we have is a tremendous asset right now so were seeing a lot of positive momentum which may not always be intuitive to everyone but i think its what makes the network the crown jewel of citi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi no doubt i appreciate all that a quick one on markets not quite as good as peers but that comes and goes i know thats a function of last year was really strong its a function of mix in any given quarter what i really want to focus on is your comments on rwa optimization what specifically are you doing i know its the banking book but i did see you taking down your capital call and redemption facility line but in markets what are you pulling back on on rwa just which pieces of that business i find that interesting mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so glenn youll remember at investor day we talked not only about rwa optimization broadly but specifically as it relates to markets and we talked about the idea of increasing our revenue to rwa ratio for markets to about over the course of that investor day period so weve been actively working across the markets business in equities in fixed income in spread products and looking for opportunities where there are lowreturning uses of rwa to either increase the returns on that or to actually kind of exit it and that includes a host of different structures it includes working with clients to post additional collateral in some instances and other types of structures like that that improve the rwa including hedging and like i said posting collateral and taking a look at margin that we have and ensuring that we are in fact getting the most for that use of rwa citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 operator thank you our next question will come from john mcdonald with autonomous research your line is now open john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yes hi thanks for taking my question mark i wanted to just clarify what i think the expense guide is for fourth quarter it seems like that the guidance for the full year implies a fourth quarter stepup to maybe billion and change from billion this quarter is that the right read a little bit of a stepup in the fourth quarter and is that just a pullthrough of investments and what would be driving that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes and so again the guidance on full year expenses hasnt changed its the to ex the impact of divestitures that would imply a bit of an uptick there it is on the heels of the continued investments that were making and that flowing through as well as how revenues kind of play out and the associated compensation activity that goes along with that so nothing extraordinary and consistent with the guidance given john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and i know its too early to give formal guidance for next year but if we look at the investor day slides it seems to imply that expenses go up for a few years until you get to the medium term is that the right read and when i annualize where youll be exiting the fourth quarter here implies billion or so next year as a starting point i mean is it fair when i read the investor day slides and think about your investments that directionally expenses probably do go up next year mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc john id say as you know right well give guidance for next quarter but i think if you think back to the investor day and you think about some of the things that we just commented on with regard to our services business wed expect to see continued tailwinds as it relates to net interest income we would expect to get to the heart of your question that we will continue to invest in the franchise in the transformation excuse me that that would obviously peak and then we would start to see the benefits start to play out from that in that mediumterm period and so yes you can probably expect some type of a tickup but ill give you more details on that when we talk about the outlook in the next quarter operator thank you our next question will come from erika najarian with ubs your line is now open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you just wanted to take a step back your to mediumterm rotce target had contemplated an to cet1 versus the that youre targeting to by midyear next year also that you laid out on that same slide that you were targeting fed funds over the medium term which seems kind of cute right now so i guess im wondering your confidence in or as you said youre confident you can hit mediumterm targets even with this creep in capital is it really that shift in the rate environment thats helping you get there despite the higher denominator mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so thank you for the question look i think there are a couple of things to think back on that still hold true which is the strategy that we built i think is a resilient strategy and it really spoke to top line momentum that we expected not just through rate increases but also through share gains and also through the businessled investments that were making and better leveraging the synergies and linkages across the franchise all of those things still hold true to the top line youre right the fed funds assumption has changed back in march i think we all were looking at a fed funds rate at the end of the year that was closer to or so and so now here we are with the hikes that weve seen looking at something certainly north of and so thats changed meaningfully but there are a number of other drivers that contribute to achieving that return including its the medium term so call it three to five years i think is how we characterized it and starting to see some of the benefits from the transformation investments that were making to your point on capital we are building to the remember that is a byproduct of a scb for this particular ccar cycle and the strategy that we describe includes a mix in our shift of revenues and earnings over time a mix towards more stable ppnr and more fee revenues that will contribute to i think a balance sheet and a mix that is certain that generates fewer losses stress losses than our balance sheet might today so the contribution of those things we think will drive that return target that weve set and we still remain confident about that now with that said there are unknowns that are out there i just spoke to many of the known and so what happens with further capital requirements in the current regulatory regime and what have you is hard to predict but well manage to that as we learn and know more about it erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my followup question is given citis valuation on book i think your current and prospective shareholders are waiting for buybacks to potentially return i guess a twopart question here number one especially if you think you could stabilize your ppnr in a stress test why a basis point management buffer versus one of your peers at basis points that reported today and secondarily as we think about the return of buybacks i imagine that once youve hit that indiscernible buybacks could return citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 but how does the banamex sale potentially impact the timing as i recall theres a currency translation adjustment that could be negative upfront at announcement to cet1 but you get that all back during close so i guess the real big question here is how should we think about what are the mile markers for the return of buyback activity at citi mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc okay thank you erika theres a lot there to unpack so if i forget anything just please remind me but ill start at the beginning which is i know where we trade in terms of book value and id love to be in a position where we were buying back given that valuation with that said were going to take it quarter by quarter as i think youve heard us say and evaluate what buyback decisions and capital actions make the most sense in light of the environment that were managing through were clearly managing through an uncertain environment we do as i just said and as youve kind of mentioned as well we do see our business mix shifting over time on the heels of our strategy i do think that over time that will contribute as i said to the capital requirements that we have but thats over the medium term and we do still see a fair amount of volatility in the stress capital buffer and part of the reason that we have the management buffer is to deal not only with that uncertainty in the scb but also in interest rates and were seeing volatility in both frankly and so well continue to evaluate the management buffer as well to see what makes sense as we move towards that medium term in terms of the mexico transaction youre right in terms of we have mentioned before the cta component to that that is a timing difference we have factored that in to the path to our by middle of next year and then factor that into achieving the longerterm targets that we set for ourselves operator thank you our next question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi can you hear me jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes we can mike mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc morning citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc look i look at the global network as a curse and a blessing i guess the curse part is simply the complexity and the expenses and mark you said expenses should go up higher next year youre not going to tell us for a few more months but im just wondering when you think can you grow revenues faster than expenses again its not new news the revenues and expenses youve guided it and youre within that range its just do we have to wait a year or three years or how long for that complexity to get more simplified so revenues can catch up to that expense growth and then on the blessing side mark you mentioned you said gained share in those client segments and i thought that was a little vague you talked about trade you talked about other activity connecting multinational corporations in this period of volatility so if you could put a little more meat on the bones as far as when you talk about market share and those tailwinds on the revenues why you have the headwinds on the expenses from the global network jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey mike its jane im jumping in because i do want to talk a bit about your point on the global network here i have to tell you im hardpressed to find a negative to the global network we start off with a vision for the bank that we laid out in march it is to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with crossborder needs who are those clients it is multinationals and their subsidiaries its institutional investors and the ultrahigh net worth clients with a heavy tilt to family offices and we serve them on fx on liquidity management on their payroll on their supply chain as well as strategic advice financing et cetera thats trillion in daily volume of that credit portfolio is investment grade so when were looking at it its the multinationals take a higher risk country its the client base were serving there of the global multinationals much more than the local players and so this is a relatively simple high returning very well growing as were seeing at the moment capability that is exceedingly hard to replicate so let me pass over to mark in terms of what are some of the examples of different areas of the drivers of growth mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc this is as i said at the beginning this is a crown jewel its not a source of complexity for the bank mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so mike id say a couple things one what i said was that we continue to gain share and i referenced specifically about basis points of share with large corporate clients and we obviously or not obviously were also winning mandates and gaining share with other client segments as well you know that the commercial banking client segment is one that were focused on given the strength of our platform and its applicability to those size clients as well citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 i mentioned that our wins are up and specifically theyre up the mandates that were winning across all client segments and that specifically with fis theyre up almost so hopefully that gives you some sense of where the revenue growth is coming from the takeaway there is its both existing as well as new clients as we kind of continue to build out the platform and build out our capabilities to reach them the second part of your question was around expenses and expenses growing and when will we have top line growth that exceeds the expense growth and id remind you that the work were doing on the transformation as well as the businessled investments are multiyear almost by definition and important in order to derive savings in our structural cost base over time and at investor day i think i pointed to by the time we got to that medium term period we would see our operating efficiency go down to less than i think weve been very deliberate about trying to give you guidance and update you on guidance for the full year and along the way and well be consistent in that discipline and i can certainly give you more color on as i mentioned earlier to john in the next quarter mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess one clarification when you say youve gained basis points of share with large corporate clients what do you mean by share share of what mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah of wallet basis points not for market share with them operator thank you our next question will come from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess one just mark wanted to clarify your nii guide for billion to billion is this total nii right its not exmarkets or anything mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc it is exmarkets ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc it is exmarkets any perspective or view on where you see markets heading in fourth quarter just given whats happened with the rate backdrop mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 i dont i very intentionally dont forecast markets nii in a rising rate environment you would normally see the markets nii come down it tends to be liability sensitive but we tend to focus on as you probably heard me say a number of times total revenues for this business and i guess what id highlight is that in periods of uncertainty and lots of market volatility our businesses tend to perform well and so well see how the fourth quarter plays out theres obviously some seasonality to it that has taken place historically and so wed have to factor all those things in but well have to see how it further evolves operator thank you our next question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is now open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi just two things one just another question on the expense side i just wanted to followup with regard to mark i think the stranded costs that you had talked about at the barclays conference and im wondering if i got the message right there which is when you exit the consumer businesses theres that is generally managed through a tsa so its a service agreement and that expense will come off over time and then theres another which is likely not to come off is that fair or is there a different message that im missing on that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thats not fair but i appreciate the ask for clarity i bucket into three buckets so one is when we do these transactions both jane and i have deep experience in this we tend to see about half of the costs go away to the buyer so when we do the transaction when we do the sale as you pointed out about is often in place as part of a transition service agreement and so theres revenues that we get paid to offset that expense until things have totally transitioned and then that goes away and then the third bucket is what i call potentially stranded cost and what jane calls not stranded cost right and that is i say potentially because theyre regional expenses that get allocated to countries for example theyre global expenses that get allocated to the region and to the country for example citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 and what we have to do and what were doing is were attacking what would otherwise be stranded cost and were attacking that by telling each of the functions in the business that heres your portion of that and come back and tell me how youre going to rethink your org structure simplify your processes in order to drive that cost out of the company right and so thats what weve been doing remember the expense base here is probably billion so you can break down kind of the population that were talking about weve already stood up a team to work with each of the businesses and each of the functions around getting in front of that cost so that we can drive that down over the nearterm period of time jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and as a scotswoman i just cant help myself but jump in here i think as mark im smiling at mark here mark and i are both pretty maniacally focused around this but id say at the moment weve had a couple of the divestitures closed we have another three next quarter and this continues on we already started on australia and the philippines and getting those expenses down as mark said there is going be and we will not be shy in capturing is an opportunity to simplify our organization further next year when we have more of the divestitures closed and streamlining more of our regional management structures more of the expenses at the global level so there is more to come on that and well be looking to do that as i indicated at investor day that will be an important part once more if the divestitures are closed starting in going into betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right so your marks potentially stranded costs and jane youre no stranded cost the no stranded cost is in the guide medium term mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc in terms of the jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc the time to get it out is that yes jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes and i think thats why as mark operator thank you citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc as mark talks about expenses youve got to look at the various different dynamics that are going on so yes weve got investments into the transformation at the moment many of those translate into better efficiency as well as a safer stronger firm the divestitures translate into lower costs but also we eliminate the stranded costs and we simplify the organization so youve got a number of different factors that we will make completely transparent to you at play in our expense base from a more structural dimension in the quarters ahead operator thank you our next question will come from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi can you guys talk about the pace of addressing some of the regulatory issues out there on the one hand you got out of aml consent order earlier this year which i think was a very big positive but on the other hand there was an article last month suggesting regulators want you to go faster and i think we all know regulators always want things to go faster in terms of these issues but i did want to ask that question thank you jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah we all want things to go faster both our clients our shareholders the management team regulators the board all so i think were fully aligned there maybe if i take a step back on this one transformation is our number one priority it will be a multiyear journey and prioritizing safety and soundness as a very important global bank is a nonnegotiable for all of us where are we i think we were delighted to see the aml consent order get closed with the occ we continue to work on the regulatory orders we have i have to say we have constant and constructive engagement with our regulators that personally i find them to be very helpful and essential to our success we have got a lot to get done as you can see from the hiring numbers weve been investing heavily in the talent and the resources that we need as weve also said this is not only going benefit our safety and soundness but also in term of our clients excellence in delivery and ultimately for our shareholders as well i think the foundation that we need for this is largely in place and so mark and i and frankly the whole management team were very focused on continuing to execute on the various plans we submitted and the overall transformation of citi from a strategic and another dimension we obviously cant give more details than that because this is confidential supervisory information but i hope that gives you a good feel matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and i guess when you say the foundations largely in place like what are some of the things that are missing or is it just a matter of say executing on the divestitures citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah its timing so some of the areas for example where were making technology investments those ones where weve had fragmented technology platforms were migrating them into a single platform or into an industry standard where weve not been on one that is what we want for the future and the scale and pace of the future those things take some time to put in place but you can see from the investments weve made both head count and the shift from consulting to much more of our own people youll see the technology increase in that shift as well so some of thats just a natural progression youd expect over time operator thank you our next question will come from jim mitchell with seaport global your line is now open jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc yeah hey good afternoon maybe just on deposits and behavior you guys clearly have a different mix by geography and by business deposits ex currency were up your peers were down close to so how do we think about deposit behavior going forward given your mix of geography and business is it just overseas rate hikes have been behind the curve versus the us but well start to see more deposit outflows over there or do you think your deposits can hold up a little better mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc its a great question and so why dont i take that so a couple things and you started to allude to it the first is that when you think about our business youve got about between icg and our pbwm businesses split in terms of the deposits you also have a us dollar denominated versus nonus dollar denominated split that is pretty meaningful as well and then to your point weve got different currencies and different rate hikes by different central banks around the world and that then is juxtaposed against different beta behavior from customers and so on the icg side we tend to see higher betas and obviously with rates increasing at a more rapid pace we expect those to get closer to our expectations in the near term were starting to see many more hikes around the globe or outside of the us and so again we expect to see betas which move at a or operate at a much lower pace level outside of the us but start to tick up and so over time i think we will see continued tailwinds from an nii as the differences between us and nonus activity play out and so should play to or has played to our benefit i think and should continue to play to our benefit if you think about what ive talked about before in terms of our ire our interest rate exposure and the cash flow approach that we are moving towards taking in some ways it captures exactly that point and so this is if you see 100basispoint move in the curve cross currencies were looking at as much as a billion increase when you look at that increase it skews more heavily towards the nonus dollar than the us dollar and that is in part because of the different moves in rate curves by currency as well as the different betas by client type in us versus nonus citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right right okay thats really helpful and then maybe just second question just on the impact in the fourth quarter your closing on three divestitures how do we think about the pl and capital impact of that in the fourth quarter mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i think i talked about the idea of the divestitures contributing close to billion for the full year or billion or so in terms of the capital impact for the full year the combination of australia and the philippines gets us to about billion or so and so the balance of the divestitures that weve scoped out for the fourth quarter should close that gap thailand malaysia bahrain the signing of china etcetera should close that gap to getting us to that billion with most of that again skewing towards the first three thailand malaysia bahrain operator thank you our next question will come from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi mark hi jane mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hello there gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc jane you talked about your global footprint and the strength that gives you as an organization and so maybe this question is very appropriate for citigroup which is the following you guys have a real good window into the global financial markets and theres been some disruption out there we all know about whats going on in the uk pension funds you had the swiss national bank come into the new york fed this week for billion of currency swaps we know theres a large broker having challenges over there so can you guys give us a flavor what are you seeing from a stress standpoint what are the liquidity metrics that youre watching to see if some other stresses pop up how the global financial markets will handle that jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 yeah its a very good question its one we spend a lot of time on i think as mark alluded were constantly doing different stress tests on the market on clients on different areas and as i said just in the opening remarks were more focused on the liquidity in the market at the moment and the impact on some counterparties much more than we are on our credit risk that could change over time depending particularly what happens from a tail risk on the geopolitics here what are we seeing going on i think a lot of the focus is in europe right now which is sort of at the center of the storm were seeing some areas where there could be energy supply constraints are impacting some clients so were watching industrial production move to the us for example which are the places where the cost of production is lower a potential buffer for some of the slowdown in us manufacturing and the like as the demand for goods soften for example were seeing areas where clients on the collateral front where theres a situation of intense volatility that hits or a surprise drop as we saw ph in gilt is having an impact on liquidity and therefore margining which is what happens and has been happening with the uk pension funds with the derivatives so a lot of the areas we look at is whats the collateral behind different institutions as we had done with the commodity players earlier on in the year weve been looking at some of the lbis at the moment and as we see different stresses were jumping on it i think the central banks are also ready to jump in if needed and are certainly attune to the importance of agility in these situations as well as are large global institutions like ourselves as to how do we help support the market the benefit for our bankers because were in a strong position on all of our capital on liquidity on balance sheet and the credit portfolios you can see is extraordinary at the moment zero losses in icg this quarter again were in a position to be able to jump in and play an important role but its a bit of whacamole i would say gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then mark just as a followup you touched on your investment banking numbers and your markets numbers and yes investment banking for everybody has been a struggle obviously this year your advisory numbers actually were better than your peers on a yearoveryear basis in terms of growth but dcm was quite a bit weaker can you kind of give us a little more color there and also how do the pipelines look going into the fourth quarter mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure so look as weve all seen the wallets have been under meaningful pressure yearoveryear down more than we did show some strong performance in parts of the business weve been hiring frankly as jane has mentioned before and filling in gaps that we have across the portfolio in healthcare tech energy et cetera and feel good about that and are seeing benefits from having made those hires dcm is really more of a function of low deal volume pretty much across the board and there really isnt a whole lot more to it than that but as you know investment banking is part of the strategy that we discussed at investor day and a key part at that and well continue to invest in it and ensure were getting the productivity out of it that the investment warrants but really not a whole lot more in dcm beyond the low deal volume across the board operator thank you our next question will come from vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is now open citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks thanks for taking my questions a couple of questions for you firstly mark just want to clarify you said nii ex markets to be up billion to billion yearonyear in the fourth quarter you were up billion year onyear in the third quarter given that there have been more rate hikes during the quarter and even later in the quarter any color on whats driving that slightly lower nii accretion rather than there actually being up at a faster pace mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah again the important factors here include volume what we see in both the loan volume the deposit volume and obviously betas and how betas play out and we talked about the idea that with the higher frequency and level of rate increases thats going to put pressure on the beta in terms of seeing it increase across the board and then the third factor is rates and what happens with rates and the timing for which that happens right when that happens matters in the quarter in terms of whether you see that benefit in it or in subsequent quarters and so those are the factors that drive that range that ive given you and its across both the pbwm portfolio as well as how it plays out in tts and given the world were managing through quantitative tightening and the like and i think the other factor is obviously fx and how that plays out so those are the main drivers vivek and the range reflects any variety of ways that they could play out in the quarter vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay completely different question for both of you securities services you talked about trillion in new business wins seems to be doing really well any color if you can remind us on what client segments youre seeing this in and i remember you saying on the call that its domestic also but any more color into where youre growing and where youre seeing all this jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc were seeing this in a number of different areas the one that is most material was the win we had with blackrock in a particularly sizable percentage of business there here in the states and in a particularly important and attractive part of the securities services business as well but we have been winning some sizable business across the board and part of this i think comes from the fact that were able to link the pre and post trades together were able to drive a lot of efficiencies for our clients and bring some insights that some of the other players are not able to do and helping them manage and get competitive advantage in their businesses so were an attractive one from that mark anything else to add mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 yes only thing id add were very pleased with the growth here and the win mandates that weve been seeing across the board but particularly in the us as jane highlights and some of it is a rate benefit but a good portion of it is again those new mandates those new additional assets that were bringing in the final point that id make on it is that and id reiterate it i guess is that this is not only one of our businesses thats growing quite rapidly but its also a high returning business for us as well and so consistent with the strategy that we talked about at investor day and one that reflects linkages across the franchise and so we feel very good about that operator thank you our next question will come from ken usdin with jefferies your line is now open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks afternoon just two quick ones mark you talked about the capital impact of the legacy exits is there a way you can dimension how much in the fourth quarter from a revenues and an nii perspective comes out from the legacy mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i do not have that in front of me ken i can i guess if we ive got a page in here that reflects the page reflects some of the size of the exit markets but i do not have that in front of me id have to circle back with you ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay i would assume thats been a part of the prior question about nii trajectory right theres a negative impact embedded in that in the fourth quarter as well right thats just part of moving forward mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah that is reflected in the nii guidance but the major drivers are largely what i referenced but yes it would be reflected in it operator thank you our next question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi as a followup why is citi still banking in russia when seemingly every other major american company or most of them are out of russia jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey there mike as i mentioned in my earlier remarks we are now informing our multinational clients who are operating in russia so these are the us european and asian core multinationals of the franchise that we are citigroup inc c corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 ending nearly all of the institutional banking services we offer them by the end of the first quarter of the cost of which i would add is not material and so at that point our only operations in russia will be those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory operations there its been very important for those multinationals that weve helped support them as they look at exiting the country and their payroll and other elements as they do so so theyve been able to wind down or exit and a few of those who have remained but we will be as i said at the very beginning our intention here is to wind down our operation in the country mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just if you could remind us you mentioned more dispositions in the fourth quarter so after whats left as far as the dispositions that you had mentioned and how are you tracking with your plan mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc we are we feel very good about how were tracking with the plan obviously mexico is left weve got vietnam india taiwan and theres one im missing indonesia i think is what im missing jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so those are the ones that are left and then china right so those are the ones that are left in the balance of or beyond jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and i think those ones again a couple of them have been rather than ones that you have a legal day legal day on its all close in one go on both which is why a couple of them are later than we had originally thought but theyre going well and the workaround them and around the stranded costs that relates to them as we talked earlier is also going nicely so were pleased with the pace and we are acting on these with urgency mike as you would expect operator thank you there are no further questions at this time ill now turn the call back over to jen landis for closing remarks jennifer landis headinvestor relations citigroup inc thank you
