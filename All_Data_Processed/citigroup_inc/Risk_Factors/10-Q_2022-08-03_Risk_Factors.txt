foreign government debt securities other secured funding is secured by less liquid securities including equity securities corporate bonds and assetbacked securities the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book assets the remainder of the secured funding activity in the brokerdealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions including under periods of stress citi manages these activities by taking into

primarily reflected a continuation of the positioning strategy of citis investment securities and related interest rate derivatives portfolio in the event of a parallel instantaneous bps increase in interest rates as of june citi expects that the billion initial negative impact to aoci would be offset in stockholders equity through the expected recovery of the impact on aoci through accretion of

capital ratio on a fully implemented basis under five different changes in interest rate scenarios for the us dollar and citis other currencies the bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low

the impact this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may to citis net interest income and aoci is greater under scenario as compared to scenario this is because the combination of changes to citis investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citis pension liabilities results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediateterm maturities changes in foreign exchange ratesimpacts on aoci and capital as of june citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citis tangible common equity tce by approximately billion or as a result of changes to citis foreign currency translation adjustment in aoci net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso euro and indian rupee in millions of dollars except as otherwise noted change in fx spot rate1 change in tce due to fx translation net of hedges as a percentage of tce take including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citis net investments in foreign currency denominated capital these movements also change the value of citis riskweighted assets denominated in those currencies this coupled with citis foreign currency hedging strategies such as foreign currency borrowings foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citis common equity tier capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital as compared

first quarter average march second quarter average june covariance adjustment also known as diversification benefit equals the difference between the total var and the sum of the vars tied to each risk type the benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and consequently the total var on a given day will be lower than the sum of the vars relating to each risk type the determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position

effectiveness of its regulatory var model regulatory var backtesting is the process in which the daily oneday var at a confidence interval is compared to the buyandhold profit and loss ie the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and repriced the following day buyandhold profit and loss represents the daily marktomarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue net interest fees and commissions intraday trading profit and loss and changes in reserves based on a confidence level citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buyandhold losses exceed the regulatory var given the conservative calibration of citis var model as a result of taking the greater of short and longterm volatilities and fattail scaling of volatilities citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of backtesting exceptions as of june there were two backtesting exceptions observed for citis regulatory var in the last months country
