quarter we earned billion aftertax or per share and for the full year billion after tax or per share these results underscore the strength of our differentiated model and were achieved as we continue to make meaningful enhancements to our capabilities and invest for future growth let me share a few examples from this past year throughout we continued to make advancements to our data and analytics

already performing at an industryleading level we hope our commitment to chatham will serve as a springboard for further economic development in other areas that have long been denied opportunity slide of our presentation captures another important element of our results which was our pivot into new account acquisition as the economic recovery took hold in late and early in the face of intensifying competition our value proposition of cashback rewards no annual fee and industryleading service remain very attractive to consumers the strong level of card acquisition contributed to our return to loan growth over the second half of last year in payments we continue to expand our business increased network volume and established new strategic partnerships we expanded global acceptance and announced new network alliances in portugal bahrain jordan and malaysia that will benefit us as crossborder travel recovers we remain committed to building out our international acceptance and well continue to make investments to expand our reach our record earnings through the year generated significant capital which we continue to put to good use in addition to our investments in acquisition brands technology and people we also returned significant capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks by repurchasing billion of common stock and increasing our quarterly dividend by as we look forward into im very optimistic about the trajectory of our business while macroeconomic conditions created strong tailwinds this past year we acted on opportunities to strengthen our business actions that will drive longterm value this year and beyond we start the new year in an excellent position and im confident that our integrated digital banking and payments model will continue to create longterm value for our shareholders and customers ill now ask john to discuss key aspects of our quarterly financial results in more detail john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger and good morning everyone as we review our fourth quarter results i echo rogers points that the actions we took last year position us for strong performance in and beyond ill begin with our financial summary on slide our strong fourth quarter results were characterized by accelerating receivable growth provision leverage and increased investments in marketing and brand revenue net of interest expense increased from the prior year excluding a million unrealized loss on our equity investments total revenue was up net interest income increased driven by growth in average receivables and an 18basispoint improvement in our net interest margin which was sequentially flat at our nim trend reflects the continued benefit from decreased funding cost and lower interest chargeoffs though these were partially offset in the fourth quarter by a discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 higher mix of promotional rate balances the growth in receivables was largely driven by card which was up yearoveryear and sequentially the primary drivers of yearoveryear growth were continued strong sales volume and significant new account growth throughout which was up yearoveryear and versus as has been the case for most of last year a significant portion of the benefits from strong sales and new accounts was offset by the sustained high payment rate the payment rate leveled off during the quarter but remains approximately basis points above prepandemic levels we currently expect that the payment rate will decline slightly over the course of however our expectations for card receivable growth is robust as ill detail in a few moments our student loan portfolio also contributed to our growth organic student loans were up over the prior year benefiting from the return to inperson learning in we continue to gain share in this product and are well positioned for continued organic expansion personal loans decreased yearoveryear mainly driven by high payment rates but were sequentially flat as we returned our underwriting criteria to prepandemic levels the second significant driver of our revenue growth was higher net discount interchange revenue which increased million or driven by a increase in sales volume yearoveryear the strong volume has continued into this year sales are up through the first half of january one significant item that relates to our net discount interchange revenue was our rewards cost and having covered most of our key revenue drivers ill point your attention to the reward rate reflected on slide we continue to benefit from strong card member engagement with our cashback rewards program our rewards costs increased versus last year on higher sales volume however the reward rate declined basis points yearover year and basis points sequentially this reflects the benefit of our integrated model and our discipline in managing the program while delivering substantial value to card members and merchant partners for the full year our rewards rate was up basis points from the prior year consistent with the historical trend we expect about basis points to basis points of annual rewards cost inflation driven mostly by shifts in mix now id like to spend a moment speaking about expense trends on slide total operating expenses increased million or yearoveryear focusing on the most significant items here marketing expense was up million as we continued to invest in new account growth and brand marketing with the launch of our new media campaign which went live across all channels in the quarter this pushed our marketing expense towards the top end of our previously guided range employee compensation was down million yearoveryear driven mainly by a million charge last year excluding this our comp expense was up yearoveryear driven largely by a higher bonus accrual information processing was down million yearoveryear and professional fees increased as a result of higher recovery fees moving to credit on slide the net chargeoff rate improved to in the quarter a decrease of basis points yearoveryear and a 9basispoint improvement from the prior quarter net chargeoff dollars were down million from the prior year and decreased million sequentially strong credit performance continued across all products card net chargeoffs were down basis points from the prior year and personal loans were basis points lower student loan chargeoffs increased slightly but remained very low at discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide our reserve rate continued to decline dropping basis points to two factors contributed to the decrease in reserve rate first we released million from reserves during the quarter driven by the continued strong credit performance of our portfolio and the relative stability of the macroeconomic outlook these factors were partially offset by the increase in total loans from the prior quarter our future reserves will be dictated by our portfolio credit trends our receivable growth and any changes to our macroeconomic assumptions looking at slide we remain extremely wellcapitalized and above our target with a common equity tier ratio of we continue to demonstrate our commitment of returning capital to shareholders as we executed on our share repurchase plan and bought back million of common stock in the quarter and paid a dividend of per share looking at funding average consumer deposits decreased yearoveryear and declined sequentially this sequential decline was driven by a decrease in consumer cds while savings and money market deposits increased slightly we managed our excess liquidity down throughout and finished the year with consumer deposits representing of total funding we will continue to target to of funding from the ph starts moving to slide where well provide some perspectives on we entered the year in a very strong position and our outlook reflects this we expect loan growth in the highsingledigits this view is based on current expectations of sales trends and the contribution from recently acquired accounts combined with a very modest decline in the payment rate we believe this view of payment rates substantially derisked our loan growth forecast we expect our nim rate to be relatively in line with the full year of and with quartertoquarter variability we expect to benefit from higher loan yields with rising interest rates this may be offset by other factors including a higher mix of promotional rate balances some degree of credit normalization and higher deposit rates which will be subject to funding needs and competitive dynamics turning to expenses we expect our total gaap expenses will increase at a midsingledigit rate this year well continue to invest for growth as we see profitable opportunities and currently expect that our marketing investments will be above levels outside of marketing we expect operating cost to increase at a lowsingledigit percent level reflecting disciplined expense control our commitment to positive operating leverage over the medium term remains a priority we expect net credit losses will average in the range of to for the full year as credit normalizes from historically low levels in we expect net chargeoffs to increase sequentially over the course of the year lastly we remain committed to returning substantial capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks as of this week we had approximately million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that expires at the end of march and expect to announce a new share repurchase authorization next quarter in summary we had an excellent fourth quarter and full year with accelerating loan growth driven by robust account acquisition and strong sales volumes excellent credit performance and a reduction in the reserve rate disciplined management of operating cost and sustained return of excess capital to shareholders discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 im exceptionally pleased with discovers execution against our business priorities in our value proposition continues to resonate with consumers we prudently invested for growth resulting in significant new accounts growth and strong sales we continue to optimize our funding mix and actively manage core deposit costs these actions and the improved macroeconomic outlook have positioned us well with that ill turn the call back to our operator britney to open the line for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse your line is open moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and congratulations on pretty strong numbers here maybe just focus on the account growth it was up could you talk about like how that compares in terms of just raw numbers of accounts to where you would have been prepandemic in the cost and anything youve done kind of from a difference in channel at credit box to get there roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah we dont disclose the number of new accounts but what i would say in terms of credit our card credit policies are pretty much on top of where they were prepandemic costs have gone up since the low levels that we saw during the pandemic as we sort of kept marketing and a lot of others pulled back but i would say as we look forward into our expectation is that the cost per account will be roughly where it was prepandemic moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great and just as a followup very pleased to hear that the commitment to operating leverage and the numbers you put out there would suggest kind of an uppersingledigit revenue growth rate and a midsingledigit expense growth rate could you talk about even if its unlikely what would happen to your expense expectations if revenue growth just didnt materialize like how would you make adjustments there john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah moshe ill take that one so well react based on the company performance and opportunities that we see in the marketplace so over the past couple of years i feel like the team has done a really really good job in terms of making calls in terms of expense allocations well continue to do that to make sure that were positioned for growth and marching towards the positive operating leverage that we talked about moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks very much discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 operator we will take our next question from mark devries with barclays your line is now open mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks could you give us a little more color about what youre seeing in credit right now i mean i think the guidance around chargeoff calls for some pretty meaningful normalization in and what kind of gets you to the low end of that guidance range and what gets you to the high end john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services great mark thanks for the questions so what were seeing in the portfolio is really really strong performance i think the numbers in the quarter demonstrate that we are seeing some difference between higher fico and lower fico account performance overall within expectations so what were projecting here is a slow normalization of credit and in terms of the guidance that we reflected here weve got pretty good line of sight to the first six months just as the accounts will go through their normal roll rates and gives us an ability to predict quite accurately once we get out beyond six months we rely more heavily on our models and the models themselves are built with a number of assumptions frankly was a tough year to call based on how we had designed our models and what actually happened in the portfolio so what we decided to do is give from my standpoint a relatively broad range that we think over time well be able to tighten and in terms of lower end versus higher end strong portfolio performance the slight difference that we saw between the higher fico and the lower ficos that continuing to kind of roll out as we expect and a positive macro environment should bring us towards the lower end mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay thats helpful just a followup on that on the model that you use is there some element of just mean reversion when chargeoffs are this low relative to normal that will push your estimates higher even if all the macro drivers seem like theyre more of a tailwind than a headwind john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah there is a level of mean revision in there in the second part of the year and just one other piece of ill say information so you can think about the breakout at least this is how we thought about it of chargeoffs the predominant piece in the second half of the year so you can think split between first half and second half and well continue to update that over the year mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay and thats very helpful thank you operator we will take our next question from john hecht with jefferies your line is now open discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 john hecht q analyst jefferies llc very good morning guys thanks very much for taking my questions just thinking about nim understanding you guys are guiding for a relatively flat nim this year but even thinking this year and beyond given that were in a rate hike cycle youre in i guess the last cycle was to and your card yields went up about of the fed funds changes and prime changes and your cost of capital went or your deposits went up a little less than that im just wondering as we go into this rate cycle should we expect any differences in that call it nim input range is there any mix shift in the deposits that will cause the betas to be different there or is there any different policies with respect to zero balance transfers that we should think about just in terms of the quartertoquarter fluctuations as the government or the fed raises rates john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah its actually a pretty complex question there so rather than try to hit each of the elements ill give you a view in terms of how we thought about nim for so we do expect some impact to nim from credit normalization we also are expecting a higher mix of bt and promotional balances which will also impact net interest margin we do get nice fees from that but certainly net interest margin will be impacted the revolve rate as the payment rate starts to normalize well see some benefits there fed funds rate changes we plan for in the year if theres more that will create some upside and in terms of impact there you could expect per fed change somewhere between and bps on a total year basis on nim depending on timing and then funding were still going to see some funding benefits from the actions we did to optimize our debt stack in and so from that standpoint it gets us to about flat but theres a lot of moving pieces in terms of deposit pricing theres still a wide gap between where were priced and the brickandmortar banks are priced so somewhere close to basis points now the digital banks most have increased deposit pricing about basis points over the past three to four weeks were a lagger on that at some point our funding needs and competitive dynamics will be such that well take a look and make appropriate changes and well do that throughout the year so the deposit betas specifics around that i would rather think about competitive dynamics and funding needs in order to get a view on how were going to price deposits on the upcycle john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thats very good color i appreciate that a followup question i guess unrelated is youre in the zone of where you were on your allowance levels as we entered post cecl implementation and pandemic era are we at a point now where you kind of say this is the new base for all exchanges in our economics forecast or is there any kind of further room for allowance bleeds tied to increases during the last couple of years john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so we go through a pretty robust process every single quarter to make sure that our reserves are fairly stated under gaap now when we did cecl day one we were seeing chargeoffs in the low and we ended discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 up posting reserve rate of i think it was so as we look at where we are today were at around assuming strong credit performance and a positive macroeconomic outlook my sense is that there is some opportunity to take that reserve rate closer to day one john hecht q analyst jefferies llc all right perfect really appreciate the answer thanks very much john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services youre welcome operator we will take our next question from rick shane with jpmorgan your line is now open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my questions im actually curious if theres some sort of rule that impacts payment rate what im curious is if you guys have done any analysis on revolve versus transaction behavior differing by spending categories specifically like everyday spend versus large episodic spend and im wondering if what were seeing in terms of payment rates with all the other factors is being impacted by bnpl john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah i wouldnt say theres an rule on payment rate so quite honestly as we looked at it in we didnt call the curve right and so what we did in the guidance is assumed a very modest decrease in payment rates we felt like that derisked our loan growth in terms of kind of behaviors between revolvers and transactors that payment rates been relatively consistent the one difference in our portfolio is the new accounts that we originated in tended to be higher ficos so more of those tend to transact versus revolve but well see as the liquidity ends up getting used in the overall economy and what that does to payment rates so weve modeled it multiple different ways theres really no standard rule of thumb its frankly somewhat dynamic in terms of what were seeing monthtomonth and quarter toquarter roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services and just to build on that we look pretty carefully by merchant by customer segment theres nothing to support a view that buynowpaylater is having any impact on payment rate richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great really appreciate the answers guys thank you very much john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services youre welcome discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 operator and we will take our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning first question i guess for roger just on the competitive backdrop obviously weve gotten bank earnings and a lot of the large banks are talking about investing more in marketing and you guys have some pretty aggressive growth targets how should we think about sort of the risks to that target given the competitive backdrop roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good question sanjay as i mentioned earlier our forecast for next year is cost per account relatively flat to where it was before the pandemic and so i think this sort of focus on competition is a little bit overblown the card business is just always competitive you have big players with good capabilities each issuer out there has their set of products set of channels and i think some natural limits on how much money they can be put to work effectively so i dont see it as a particularly high risk to our growth forecast and we have a very differentiated product were seeing good benefits on the acquisition side from our investments in analytics so we feel good even in the current environment sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and i guess i have one for john the noninterest income revenue line has done quite well over the course of this year even excluding obviously excluding the investment gains could you just talk about what kind of growth we should expect in that line going forward john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so the big driver there was obviously discount and interchange revenue which was up yearoveryear and then after rewards cost in the quarter so super strong growth there which that will generally run consistent with sales and were expecting sales not to stay in the mid but kind of come down to strong doubledigits and then into weaker doubledigits by the fourth quarter i dont know if thats right or not it seems like theres been a lot of benefit from the new account acquisition and also where our card has been positioned in peoples wallets so thats been positive theres also the factor that people are using less cash and charging more so that will continue to benefit sales interchange and net discount and interchange in terms of the other items the amount of cash in the economy actually helped cash advance fees which was positive and our expectation is that well have outside of discount and interchange growth fairly similar to net interest income sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 operator and well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services good morning roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi can you can you hear me roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay one maybe its a little bit of theoretical question but im just trying to understand how youre thinking about borrower capacity the borrowing capacity of your customer set relative to precovid im asking the question because jobs more available wages rising so that seems like they might have more capacity to borrow but then weve got inflation increasing so how do you think through those things roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services it will of course vary by segment but certainly households that are seeing rising incomes will have a greater ability for debt service and for many households thats how they determine how much debt they take on its complicated a bit by some households still having pentup savings from strong earnings and not many opportunities to spend and of course other costs going up whether its childcare or daytoday expenses on one hand will drive increases in sales but on the other hand decreases disposable income for debt service so a mix of factors but we netnet wed expect strong consumer demand for credit next year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then as im thinking about the other legs of the loan growth platform here student loan and personal could you talk through how you see those drivers impacting the growth guide that youve got discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure so student loans we feel really good about where were positioned in the market our products our brand our ability to take share whats a bit the wildcard is just enrollment and i think enrollments were down yearover year which was a surprise to i think the entire higher education industry theres a bit of a correlation the stronger the job market fewer people decide to pursue an education because theyre making too much outside so i think it will be more that factor and well see peak season but im confident in our ability to continue gaining share for personal loans we took a little longer to return to prepandemic credit criteria for that product just given the higher volatility but as john said quarteroverquarter were now flat and so we would expect that to return to growth in betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and the balance transfer activity theres a bit of a link between personal and card i know balance transfer comes before personal loan growth but hows that legging in at this stage has there been a takeup beginning there yet or is that more of a back half outlook roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services so john talked about promotional balances as having an impact on nim i would say a lot of that is driven by new accounts so as you ramp up new accounts youll see that but also portfolio activity as well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services thanks operator and we will take our next question from kevin barker with piper sandler your line is now open kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler companies thank you given your growth rates that youre projecting out there i mean do you feel like you can achieve a sub40 efficiency ratio sometime in the foreseeable future whether it be run rate close to late maybe early john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thanks kevin we specifically commented on positive operating leverage so as we deliver that obviously the efficiency ratio will improve my expectation is that we can get into the high within the mediumterm so we built the plan essentially contemplating significant investment in marketing and then working through the other discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 elements of the cost structure in order to create as much efficiency and capacity to drive new growth as that model continues to build upon itself my expectation is that those high30 numbers are certainly very very achievable kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler companies and then a followup on some of your comments around credit i believe you said you expect it to increase sequentially throughout the year did i hear that correctly and then i mean could you just give us a little bit more detail on your expectations for the cadence of net chargeoffs given were at an exceptionally low level and typically you have quite a bit of seasonality can you just give us a little bit more color around your expected cadence on chargeoffs throughout the year john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so it will be difficult to expand more deeply upon the comments that ive already made so we do expect it to increase sequentially there is some degree of seasonality i dont view that as like a material driver to what were going to be seeing and i also mentioned that the chargeoffs are more weighted to the second half of the year than the first half of the year and that weve got pretty decent line of sight to the first half so thats split out somewhere around first half second half is probably as deep as i can go on on the chargeoff numbers right now kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler companies okay thank you for the color john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah of course operator and we will take our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo your line is now open donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning roger as you come out of the pandemic i was just curious if theres any areas of strategic interest new products et cetera that youre looking at its been pretty consistent for the last several years roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah certainly were always looking for new opportunities on the payment side of our business and there the versatility of our capabilities you saw some of that with our partnership with sezzle in terms of our ability to provide easier connectivity to merchants so on the payment side both in the us and globally were looking for opportunities on the card side we feel really good about the product set we have we are virtually focused on consumer i think there is a huge opportunity to continue to grow our noncard products and so we talked about investing more in marketing our deposit products before the pandemic clearly when we were in a significant excess discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 liquidity position it didnt make sense to put a lot of marketing behind deposits but thats something i would expect to see in donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and any changes on your international acceptance push or is it sort of you just kind of inch your way into growth roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services we continue to push out i think what you heard in the call our favorite way of expanding internationally through networktonetwork partnerships its just much more costeffective than working with individual acquirers although we do that as well theres also a big focus on acceptance in the us around the migration to digital so working with other networks on secure remote commerce everything from transit implementations but again were now up to nettonet partnerships and i feel that theres room to continue growing recently announced a partnership in serbia actually this week donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator and we will take our next question from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer your line is now open dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc great thanks so much for the time i just want to follow up on one of the answers you had before do you think that the ability to reach more customers and spur spend through marketing has an overall direct relationship between which fico band or income level these customers have and is this why you think perhaps there could be those diminishing returns on marketing investment at perhaps slightly different overall rates between what customer base one issuer may have versus another thanks and i just have a followup roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i dont think we said we expected diminishing returns on marketing credit is pretty similar to what it was prepandemic and i mentioned our projected cost per account and a lot of our marketing does go to new accounts cost per account were projecting that to be pretty much on top of where it was prepandemic different issuers certainly have different business models theres one whos particularly focused on subprime others are much more aggressive at the superprime we have been very clear for many many years that ours is a lendfocused business going after that prime revolver segment weve tailored our products for that our underwriting capabilities and again we feel very good about the return were getting on the dollars we spend in marketing dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 great thank you and can you maybe talk about how the competitive landscape is evolving and what products are likely to either meaningfully compete not ultimately compete and somewhat compete with your everyday spend credit card products and perhaps maybe which spend categories maybe most of that competition could reside versus least likely thanks so much roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i think clearly what everyones watching is buynowpaylater as i mentioned earlier we havent seen that have a noticeable impact on our base in my mind its closer to traditional sales finance so there have always been competing products out there whether its on the private label side whether its personal loans for debt consolidation et cetera so we focus on getting a broad mix of spend even through this year were seeing strong performance across every category travel is holding up actually in january surprisingly well given the state of that pandemic so we think well continue to grow across categories and in fact as one of the beauties of our program it sort of reinforces different categories of spend on a rotating basis as opposed to products that are really particularly tailored to an individual category of spend dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc perfect thanks so much operator and we will take our next question from robert napoli with william blair your line is now open robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you good morning everybody roger john nice quarter i really like the guide on loan growth versus expense growth just on the expense growth side i mean if you theres a lot of investment going on in certainly some of the major banks on technology and i know that discover has invested in technology over the years so maybe just your thought process on where your tech stack stands your thoughts on private cloud versus public cloud and the need to invest to compete over the next several years roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah good question i think our perspective may be a little different than some of the big banks and of course we have a narrower range of businesses so i cant really comment on some of their investment certainly we are focused on competing with the fintechs but its not just about spending money it reminds me of its like someone saying im just going to keep eating more and more until i lose weight the competition those fintechs are not spending more on technology our focus is around capabilities its on agility its on speed to market and so if you look at last year once you sort of sort through for onetime items technology spend was relatively flat but that doesnt mean there wasnt a huge focus around our capabilities weve talked about our investments discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 in data and analytics so its really more about speed and you dont get there just through sheer dollars of spending robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc okay and i guess private cloud versus public cloud and the importance of your cloud strategy indiscernible roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so great question were focused on a hybrid cloud strategy so a mix of both i think theres sometimes companies seem to take a purist element that theres something great about having of your applications on the cloud whether or not your gl resides on the cloud is not going to really make a difference for your business but we are heavy users of the public cloud in particular for our data and analytics areas where the speed and massive amounts of storage are critically important robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and if i could just sneak in your spend growth is really strong how much of that is inflation but what are your thoughts on inflation and how it affects your business and the impact that maybe its having on the spend growth numbers you reported which were pretty strong john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services hey bob ill take that weve been really pleased with the sales running through the card the inflation has had a small impact so you think on average maybe to in and we didnt model that out specifically my sense is it would be robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc great thank you appreciate it operator and we will take our next question from mihir bhatia with bank of america your line is now open mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning and thank you for taking my question so maybe first i just wanted to go back and just clarify a little bit about your guidance and just wanted to make sure i understand some of the key assumptions embedded in there so first like on payment rates i think you said you expect it to slightly decline a little bit in and i was wondering if we were to see normalization happen a little bit faster lets say they normalize back to the normalized levels in would that push your loan growth up to like lowdoubledigits or am i or is that like too ambitious in terms of like the impact what im trying to understand is the impact of the payment rate on loan growth there discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 and then just also related to just this guidance question just on rate hikes and i apologize if i missed this in your earlier comments did you say how many rate hikes or how many basis points you were assuming in your guidance john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so we assumed thanks for the questions we assumed two rate hikes in our guidance and in terms of payment rate as i said very modest improvement so or a reduction so if payment rate were to normalize at the pace you just described which i dont think it will mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc right john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services but if it were to do that it would certainly be very accretive to the loan growth im not going to get into specifics whether it takes us to doubledigits or not mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay no i understand thats helpful though and then just wanted to the other question i wanted to ask is just about understanding your credit underwriting or risk appetite currently you did mention normalization is happening maybe a little bit more on the lower ficos have you tweaked your underwriting or marketing in the last few weeks or quarters in response to that or is it still very much as expected so its all systems go roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah no we havent and i think its important to note that the life of loan losses assumptions we use for new account underwriting is not driven by where losses are currently so audio gap portfolio performance and what were seeing but we use sort of by segment and actually by individual account forecasts of life of loan as we determine our marketing and credit criteria mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc thank you roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services thanks operator and we will take our next question from bill carcache with wolfe research your line is now open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 thank you good morning roger and john is there roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc is there any reason to be concerned about the pace of credit normalizing faster than receivables growth john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services from my perspective no and ill tell you why first the macros are the macroeconomic conditions are super positive right so theres more job openings than there are people looking for jobs the consumers will have more dollars into their paycheck as a result of this inflation and there is a substantial amount of savings still left in the economy from largely from kind of change in behaviors and government stimulus so im not frankly seeing that as a risk in as we get out into theres less certainty around that bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood maybe a related followup theres a lot of consternation around ncos normalizing higher but do you think that the environment that were in today where youre seeing the revenue benefits from the accelerating loan growth that youre putting up on one hand and then also on top of that youve also got the reserve rate remaining well above day one levels and so when you think about the risk of growth math headwinds and the need to build reserves on that strong loan growth that youre seeing the risk that that overwhelms the revenue benefits from the loan growth and the fact that the reserve rate is higher can you talk to that interplay and how youre thinking about that john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so when we let me start with the reserves because it plays into the rest of your question so when we looked at reserves for the quarter what we wanted to see was the impact of the ending the end of most of the government support programs most ended in september so we had one quarter worth of data we looked at it we saw no real change to the portfolio dynamics were hoping to see another quarter and then reevaluate overall reserve rate but that day one number and ill say the normalized chargeoffs in the would support a view that down the road well have some opportunity on reserves in terms of new vintages and the kind of chargeoff impacts from those this company has been through years and years of cycles with new vintages were very thoughtful in terms of how we do the underwriting weve got some improvements from the within underwriting from the advanced analytic tools that weve put in place so my sense is as portfolio seasons were going to see some increases in chargeoffs but well within the expectations of how we underwrite and well within the expectations of this guidance and the macroeconomic outlook discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thank you for taking my questions john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services you got it bill operator and we will take our next question from meng jiao with deutsche bank your line is now open meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi great good morning guys i wanted to follow up with the question on the competitive environment weve seen a few competitors coming in with new offerings and i was sort of hoping for some more color as to whether youve seen any readthroughs to possible yields possible tightening or sort of anything else outside of elevated marketing spend with this increase in competition roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah great question in general the competition takes the form of higher rewards increased marketing spend youll see some players start putting up big onetime signing bonuses as they look to grow some players may start extending their promotional periods but given sort of the inability to reprice cards post card act you tend not to see it drive yield compression and as i mentioned earlier a lot of those products and the competition seems to be targeting that sort of super prime transactor segment that is not one that we aggressively go after so our projection for flat cost per account next year reflects our view on our ability to compete in this environment meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got you great and then secondly john i wanted to sort of circle back in your comments regarding the difference that youre seeing between higher and lower fico scores i mean are you sort of seeing that in early stage delinquency sort of diverging just any other further details that you might be able to provide in that specific difference john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah its in the kind of roll to one so one delinquent bucket out there and the fact that were talking about it is ill say is intended to indicate that were paying attention to the entire portfolio and that we have a growing comfort in terms of how the credit outlook is in the performance of the company into meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it thank you for taking my questions discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 operator and we will take our next question from bill ryan with seaport research partners your line is now open bill ryan q analyst seaport global securities llc good morning thank you for taking my questions just a couple of things first on promotional balances looking at your portfolio today as a percent of the total where are you versus kind of like the history of the company or the historic norm if you will and what is the typical duration of the promotional balances and then ill go ahead and ask the second question but looked like theres a little bit of a drop in protection product revenue this quarter as a percent of the portfolio i was just curious if theres any specific callouts there thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay great so the kind of the promotional balance content of the portfolio we tend not to kind of go into expansive detail about that so my comments on net interest margins should give an indication that we intend to use that as a tool to help some origination activity in terms of the protection revenue so we have an existing product that we stopped marketing some time ago thats essentially providing value to the customer set but if you dont market a tool obviously your revenue line gets impacted we have a new product that we launched very very soft launch that we actually havent done any broad marketing yet so my expectation is that that line will be flat to down in bill ryan q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thank you eric wasserstrom vice president corporate strategy investor relations
