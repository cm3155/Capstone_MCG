hochschild and john greene our chief financial officer after we conclude our formal comments therell be time for a questionandanswer session during the qa session we request that you ask one question followed by one followup question after your followup question please return to the queue now its my pleasure to turn the call over to roger roger c hochschild president chief executive officer director discover financial services thank you eric and thanks to our listeners for joining todays call we had another period of strong financial results in the third quarter with earnings of billion after tax or per share in many respects these results reflected the unique benefits of our integrated digital banking and payments model which continues to be a source of significant competitive advantage by supporting our value proposition to consumers and merchants and differentiating our brand these advantages enabled our continued investment in account acquisition technology and analytics while generating substantial capital in an environment characterized by new entrants and intensifying competition we believe the strengths of our model position us to accelerate our growth underlying our results this quarter were three important advancements the first was our return to yearoveryear receivables growth which was driven by our investment in acquisition and brand marketing and continued strong sales trends total sales were up over levels with strong momentum across all categories even travel sales increased and while they dropped a bit in august due to concerns related to the delta variant travel has steadily improved since then discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 we also continued to see attractive opportunities for account acquisition and increased our marketing investment to take advantage of this while the competitive environment has intensified new accounts are now up over reflecting the strength of our value proposition this value proposition remains anchored in our industry leading onshore customer service model no annual fees and useful and transparent rewards while some of our peers had to reinvigorate their rewards offerings at substantial cost our rewards costs were up only basis points yearoveryear and nearly all of this increase was driven by higher consumer spending as evidenced in our strong discount revenue given these dynamics we will continue investing in new accounts as long as the environment supports profitable opportunities and a robust account growth and our expectations for modest improvement in payment rates supports our view of stronger receivables growth in the second key trend was credit which remained exceptionally strong our disciplined approach to credit management and favorable economic trends contributed to a record low net chargeoff rate and continued low delinquencies the delinquency outlook affirmed our expectations that losses will be below last years levels for the full year and supported additional reserve releases during the quarter and third is the continued expansion of our payments business pulse saw a meaningful increase in debit volume with growth yearoveryear and a increase over the third quarter of demonstrating both the impact of the recovery and an increase in debit use through the pandemic our diners business has also started to see some improvement from the global recovery with volume up from the prior year as the global economy recovers we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our international reach in summary our value proposition continues to be attractive and our integrated digital banking and payments model supports profitable longterm customer relationships and is highly capital generative i continue to feel very good about our prospects for future growth ill now ask john to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger and good morning everyone once again our results this quarter reflect strong execution and the continued economic recovery looking at our financial summary results on page there are three key things i want to call out first our total revenue net of interest expense is up from the prior year excluding a million unrealized loss due to market adjustments on our equity investments including this revenue is up for the quarter second is a continuation of very strong credit performance net chargeoffs were down million from the prior year which supported a million reserve release this quarter lastly we continue investing for growth with increased marketing spend higher operating expenses in other area were largely related to the economic recovery ill go over the details of our quarterly results in our full year outlook on the following slides looking at loan growth on slide we saw the return to growth this quarter with ending loans up over the prior year and up sequentially card loans were the primary driver and were also up yearoveryear and over the prior quarter the yearoveryear increase in card receivables was driven by strong sales volume and discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 robust account acquisitions sales growth continued to accelerate and was up over the third quarter of yeartodate new accounts were up from the prior year and up over levels the contribution from these factors was mostly offset by the ongoing high payment rates as household savings and cash flows remain elevated the payment rate was approximately basis points over prepandemic levels we anticipate that the payment rate will moderate a bit as most federal covid support programs have ended and consumer savings rates have started to decrease that said we expect payment rates to remain above historical levels through looking at our other lending products organic student loans increased from the prior year with originations up as most schools have returned to the normal inperson learning model personal loans decreased driven by high payment rates our underwriting criteria have returned to prepandemic levels and we expect a return to growth in this product in future periods moving to slide net interest margin was up basis points from the prior year and basis points from the prior quarter compared to the prior quarter the increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by lower interest chargeoffs and lower funding costs this was partially offset by a higher mix of promotional rate balances card loan yield was up basis point sequentially as lower interest chargeoffs were offset by the increased promotional balance mix yield on personal loans declined basis points sequentially due to lower pricing the margin continued to benefit from lower funding costs primarily driven by maturities of higher rate cds and an increased mix of lower rate savings and money market balances average consumer deposits were flat yearoveryear and declined from the prior quarter the quarterover quarter decline was largely driven by consumer cds we also saw a slight decline in savings and money market deposits as consumers continued to spend excess levels of liquidity we also continued to optimize our funding stack late in september we executed our first abs issuance since october consisting of a billion security with a threeyear fixed rate coupon of basis points and a fiveyear million security with a fixed coupon of basis points these were our lowest abs coupons ever and show good execution and timing by our treasury team looking at revenue on slide total noninterest income increased million or over the prior year excluding the unrealized loss on equity investments net discount and interchange revenue was up million or driven by strong sales volume this was partially offset by increased rewards costs due to high sales in the category which was restaurants and paypal both this year and last we continue to benefit from strong sales through our partnership with paypal while restaurant sales were up yearoveryear as dining activity recovered loan fee income was up million or primarily driven by lower late fee chargeoffs and higher nonsufficient funds and cash advance fees looking at slide total operating expenses were up million or from the prior year the details reflect our focus on investing for future growth while managing our operating costs employee compensation increased million driven by a higher bonus accrual in the current year excluding bonuses employee compensation was down from the prior year from lower head count marketing expense increased million supporting another quarter of strong new account growth discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 other expense included a million legal accrual professional fees were up million primarily due to higher recovery fees courts reopening combined with strong credit and economic conditions have driven an increase in recoveries and their associated fees yeartodate recoveries were up compared to the prior year the benefit of these costs is reflected in lower credit losses moving to slide the trend of sustained strong credit performance continued total net chargeoffs were a record low at down basis points yearoveryear and basis points sequentially total net chargeoff dollars decreased million from the prior year and were down million quarteroverquarter credit performance was strong across all products as evidenced by the net chargeoff rates on card private student loans and personal loans moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide this quarter we released million from reserves and our reserve rate dropped basis points to the reserve release reflects continued strong credit performance and a largely stable macroeconomic outlook the impact of these was partially offset by a increase in loans from the prior quarter our economic assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately by yearend and gdp growth of just over these assumptions were slightly less positive than those used in the second quarter but still reflect a strong economic outlook looking at slide our common equity tier for the period was well above our target we repurchased million of common stock and as we had previously announced increased our dividend payable by to per share these actions reflect our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders on funding we continue to make progress towards our goals of having deposits be to of our funding mix deposits now make up of total funding up from in the prior year wrapping up on slide our outlook for has not changed and reflects continued strong execution against our financial and strategic objectives in summary we remain well positioned for profitable growth from improving loan trends credit performance trends remain favorable reflecting positive macroeconomic conditions and our approach to underwriting and credit management investments for growth have supported a significant increase in new accounts while weve contained operating expenses lastly our integrated digital banking and payments model is highly capital generative allowing us to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders we look forward to providing our outlook for on our conference call in january with that ill turn the call back to our operator ashley to open the line for qa discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions and well take our first question from john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning i want to see if you can give us a little more color on your payment rate expectations i know youre expecting to remain elevated through but just want to see if youre starting see signs of accounts that typically revolve start to see some declines in payment rates there and then i guess how material of an inflection you think we can see through or do you think thats not likely until thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services great all right thanks for the question so the payment rate has been persistently high and what we did see in the month of september was that that ticked down mildly it did increase from july to august which was frankly a bit of a surprise but as i look at the data were seeing here in terms of revolve and the forecasted trends my expectation is that in the fourth quarter it will continue to step down some of that has to do with government support programs ending in september and some of it has to do with the holiday season and then as we look beyond the holiday season into i do expect that it will continue to step towards a normalized rate but frankly i dont think that will happen until so how do we think about the implications from that certainly the payment rate is a bit of a headwind to growth but what weve seen is really strong account acquisition and strong sales growth which to date has helped offset some of that payment rate impact so overall we feel very very comfortable that the balance of and then will have a bit of tailwind related to both payment rates declining and then strong execution from the new accounts and sales growth john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thanks john and then on the account acquisition front i know you indicated that you expect marketing costs to be higher in the second half so if you can give us a little bit more detail around the expectation there and how they could trend for the fourth quarter and then does that imply that you could see some continued upside pressure into on marketing as you drive account acquisition in light of pressured payment rates john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah yeah so from a marketing standpoint we spend the money as we see opportunity to drive profitable new accounts and frankly weve had a great quarter and a great year with that the third quarter spend actually came in mildly lower than what we originally anticipated and the guidance i had provided on the last call was that we would approximate the levels of total marketing expense i think it will be a little bit under that a bit under that largely not because of opportunities but basically kind of some processoriented stuff in terms of account targeting so we feel like the money well spend in the discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 fourth quarter will certainly generate positive new account growth it will pick up from third quarter certainly and provide us a good trajectory for john pancari q analyst evercore group llc great thanks for taking my questions john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you operator and well take our next question from ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc roger you talked about intense competition and the impact of new entrants can you maybe just expand on those points about what youre seeing competitively how you think discover is positioned for it and where do you believe this is having the biggest impact on your business and how are you responding for it thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure thanks for the question i think my actual comment was good growth in the face of intense competition and i think really sums it up well the competition in the card business is always intense we were lucky enough to have a lapse in and so saw extraordinarily good cost per account but its what were used to facing it will vary based on which issuers are refreshing their cards or have more of a desire than growth for growth than others but i think our focus on a clear differentiated value proposition has resulted in continued strong generation of new accounts and im excited about what i see in terms of the new entrants we see that less in the core credit card space but i would say very very aggressive competition around personal loans and thats an area where we focused on the longterm remain disciplined in our underwriting and what were willing to invest in new accounts and are used to seeing competitors come and go discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and if i could ask a followup question to the question john asked prior so john in terms of marketing the level youd be hitting in the fourth quarter as it steps up a little bit should we think about that as a goforward run rate are there more investments that needed to be made and then second there was comments about bts increasing as it relates to marketing can you maybe just help us understand where are we today versus prepandemic levels and what is the strategy to continue to increase balance transfer activity on the goforward basis thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services sure on the marketing spend that will be determined they are determined based on the opportunities we see as we look at we do see a continued benign credit environment and frankly a very strong opportunity to drive profitable new account growth so as that opportunity continues to persist well continue to spend marketing dollars so what i would suggest is we concentrate here on and then in the january call well talk about in terms of the opportunities there but ill leave you with this point that the fourth quarter trajectory should help inform what we intend to spend in in terms of balance transfers we did see an impact from some of the increased balance transfers that we executed in early part of in the third quarter in terms of mild impacts to margin well continue to take a look at that space and see what we can generate profitably its been a good source of account acquisition for us historically and well continue to remain disciplined and put those prime revolver accounts on the balance transfer ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for taking my questions john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you ryan operator and well take our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning i guess roger a little bit of a longerterm question around your debit business it seems like were going to have more direct to bank payments in the united states over time and theres a lot going on paypal potentially buying pinterest can you talk about how you see debit evolving over the long term and are there any implications given that you own a network roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 sure great question there are always i would say new payment schemes and methods out there a lot of them though tend to rely on existing payments so you think about when apple launched their wallet even paypal the vast majority of their volume is processed through existing payment networks and debit processing is incredibly complex and quite frankly very low margin and very efficient as you look at how sort of the three major debit networks us mastercard and visa operate and right now given the interchange caps that a lot of banks have the economics for them are relatively thin so while we look at what the fed might be proposing what goes on in other markets i dont see anything in the near or even medium term that looks like it has the potential and quite frankly youre starting to see an increase in volume on the debit side even a lot of the buy now pay later players are leveraging debit for their payments donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc you dont see debit really going away per se and being replaced by directtoaccount payments in the us roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services no the risk management of payments is quite complex in terms of both fraud and identity there are a lot of processes and controls that the major networks have in place theres a robust ecosystem if you think about pointofsale devices merchant acquirers and so to think that that will change suddenly i see as a low probability donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator and well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi hey roger just following up on that is there an opportunity for you to take your debit network and debit capabilities and expand it into that new i wouldnt call it new i guess but into that revitalized interest in debit that were seeing roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah great question betsy certainly we have a unique set of network assets and can provide connectivity to merchants whether through proxy card numbers or a series of other technologies and work closely with a number of fintechs around that so thats at the core of some of what we do with sezzle actually that was the beginning of our relationship with marqeta many many years ago and there are a lot of others that are either in the market now or that were in discussions with so i think the pulse and the debit assets we have combined with our signature network are an advantage and one that we look to monetize betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 okay and then as were thinking about the dance thats coming over the next couple of years between loan growth and credit normalization can you help us understand how youre thinking about managing that trajectory because what i heard earlier in the call is youve been getting more and more efficient at account acquisition right part of your marketing spend coming in lower than expected or at least lower than consensus than we expected is a function of you doing something i dont know if its cloud or technology or what to get more efficient at account targeting and account acquisition so on the one hand youve got that running in a very positive direction you talked about the payment rates being a little bit of a headwind to monetizing that but at the same time weve got credit normalizing so is there an opportunity for you to pull levers on marketing to generate some more loan growth or is it more likely to come from the personal loan side or the student loan side as credits normalizing how should we think about how youre managing that john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah hey betsy ill take this one so theres a lot to that question so let me just give a view in terms of what were seeing as we closed out the third quarter so as i mentioned the payment rate is stepping down and from august to september we expect that to continue that will help certainly drive loan growth my sense is today that theres a relationship between the payment rate and sales activity so the persistently high payment rate i think has driven sales activity across the industry now we benefited i would say slightly disproportionately in terms of driving incremental sales partly due to the acquisition point you mentioned so theres two dynamics the third dynamic is credit normalizing and my sense is that credit normalization will continue through into so today where i sit im positive on credit so those factors in the aggregate in addition to the point you mentioned in terms of account targeting i think position us pretty well in for positive loan growth now the specifics will come in a little bit later in january when we give our view but were all positive on that front today betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and could you touch on what was driving that account acquisition being more efficient you mentioned the processoriented improvement so what specifically are you talking about there roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services so betsy its roger again a lot of the enhancements that were seeing are leveraging the advanced analytics and so thats really helping both on the underwriting side with sort of swapin swapouts as well as better targeting combined with investments were making from beginning to end in the martech stack and we think those are already serving us well but theres also plenty of upside as we continue to focus on that area betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it all right thank you operator and well take our next question from bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning roger and john roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc i wanted to followup on your conviction in more robust loan growth in if we were to get even just modest midsingledigit spending growth next year do you think the incremental tailwind from payment rate normalization could be enough to support doubledigit loan growth and just to clarify on this point did you say earlier john that you think we could see payment rates get back to sort of normalized maybe levels by the end of is that a reasonable expectation john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services so is the horizon that were looking at for payment rate to normalize and when that happens we expect savings rate to return to normalized levels so one view is continue to watch the savings rate and that should help inform payment rate thats frankly one of the metrics we look at in terms of robust loan growth in let me just put it this way here because were going to hold off until january on providing explicit details but the new account originations have been important for growth sales activity has been important for growth the payment rate as i mentioned in the prepared remarks has been a headwind not completely unanticipated we did see it mildly higher than what we had modeled but were still on track for delivering the loan growth that we talked about for it will be informed by all those factors and shared bill in more detail in january bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood if i can followup on a separate question on bnpl risk i guess theres a group on one side that thinks that its largely customers who cant qualify for credit and are just using bnpl to turn their debit cards into credit cards weve heard the ceo of sezzle which we know is one of your partners sort of speak to that point and then theres this other group that is more concerned about the competitive threat posed by certain bnpl players that do longerterm installment lending and the risk that theyll eat into margins and pricing over time can you frame for us how youre thinking about the competitive threat and now that youve had a little bit more time to study whats happening with the different bnpl players roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure so ill start with the end there while weve had more time to study it id say the market is not yet mature and i think market clearing economics have yet to be established part of the challenge is there are many segments within buy now pay later from the people financing a multithousanddollar purchase which by the way discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 theyve done for years in terms of traditional sales finance versus sort of more spreading out payments on worth of cosmetics so those segments all have different characteristics certainly at the lower end there are many customers who are either debit preferring or do not have access to significant amounts of credit but i think youll continue to see it evolve youre starting to see some pressure from merchants who are unwilling to pay take rates above what they pay in card so right now we certainly see opportunity on the payment side as i talked about earlier leveraging our assets over time we think there may be opportunity for us as an issuer and again partially leveraging our unique model and our proprietary network but right now i would say were not seeing any noticeable impact on revolving loans and believe that we are well positioned to respond if it does emerge bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks roger and john appreciate you taking my questions john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thanks bill operator and well take our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i wanted to follow up on some of ryans questions on competition i guess roger when you think about the competitive landscape on a goforward basis you looked at the post financial crisis period a lot of that competition was transactororiented like people going after transactor customers do you think this time its going to be a little bit different given what unfolded last time or do you think that its sort of going to be the same im just curious as you think about how youre setting up competitively roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sanjay i am lucky enough to be able to look back over multiple cycles of competition and it has varied everything from sort of an intense focus across the board on prime revolvers to transactors i think certainly american express will stay focused on that spendbased model a lot of banks focus on those transactors because they are very profitable customers not so much in card but in other segments of the business the prime revolver space has historically been the most challenging in terms of what it requires from a value proposition and underwriting for transactors its really about rolling out a risk rewards program so we expect to see competition across the spectrum but what impacts us most will be that in the prime revolver space sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and you dont see any of that really intensifying relative to what you anticipated i mean its pretty consistent discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i would say its intensified significantly since sort of the lull during the pandemic but its now getting back to i would say more normalized levels sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and then john just one followup on nim i know were not talking about next years guidance until next quarter but just broadly speaking as we sit here today with your nim at pretty high levels relative to history as the growth comes do you envision that to be a tailwind for the nim or does that start counteracting some of this because the bt rates increased im just curious sort of how we should think about the progression going forward thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thanks sanjay so if you go back and look at nim historically youll see that it was subjected to frankly higher funding costs from unsecured term debt what weve tried to do is shore up the liability side of the balance sheet so targeting based on or from deposits and then the rest a combination of secured and unsecured security offerings so that will create stability in terms of the funding cost in terms of pluses and minuses to the revenue line what well see is some btrelated impacts to nim youll see credit if it does normalize a bit of credit normalization in terms of nim but youll also see that sustained impact from funding i just talked about so were looking at nim to be higher than what weve experienced historically and were going to compare how we end the year in terms of the balance sheet position and see how that impacts but overall i would say the funding position has created more stability and a economic benefit to investors sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood thank you operator and well take our next question from mihir bhatia with bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thank you for taking my question maybe to start if we could just clarify a little bit on the marketing expense guidance i guess maybe for the fourth quarter i understand you dont want to talk about yet but just for the fourth quarter when you talk about marketing expense relative to levels are you talking on a quarterly basis so fourth quarter were looking at 235ishmillion i understand you may not want to give exact numbers but should we be thinking on a quarterly basis or on a full year basis because just given the backup in the first three quarters of the year that would be a pretty big increase versus on a quarterly basis discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc so just want to make sure we clarify that thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services so thanks so when we referenced were talking a full year basis so then that would force folks to do a little bit of math on the third quarter and fourth quarter we came in lower in the third quarter than we anticipated fourth quarter we expect it will increase from the million so to frankly remove some ambiguity on this so it will be somewhere in the range of million to call it million mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay understood thank you and then john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services i hesitate to give that level of specificity but given the confusion i just wanted to kind of put it away mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc sure and we appreciate that just maybe just taking a step back on the credit side and just longerterm consumer credit performance as you underwrite new accounts can you just talk about what kind of throughthecycle loss rate assumptions youre making i guess what im really trying to understand is what is the normalized loss rate for your credit card portfolio as we think about longerterm economics roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so what i would confirm is we do use a throughthecycle loss rate and so do not use current losses but thats not something we disclose mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thanks operator and well take our next question from arren cyganovich with citi please go ahead discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks the pace of spending by your cardholders accelerated a little bit in relative to is that consistent through the quarter or did it show any signs of rising or falling in terms of the cadence there roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services weve seen ups and downs in particular we talked about a bit of a softening around travel that occurred in august and i think that was driven by a lot of what was going on with the pandemic but we continue to see very robust sales volume even continuing into october arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thanks and then the comment on the personal loan pricing and the competitive pressures there is that mainly from new entrants in the market were seeing a lot of different types of personal loan models coming to market in the past couple of years is that something that you would expect to continue as competitive pressure going forward or is this more of a just marking down relative to where the existing book was roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah a lot of it is coming from new entrants personal loans are probably the easiest to fund outside of a bank and have the easiest servicing requirements and so its where a lot of the new entrants will go with new models we are disciplined both on credit but as well as pricing and will not go below the targeted returns we want to hit a lot of times that will flush its way through when they either dont get the performance that they want to see or have other challenges you do get some times people who are prioritizing growth over returns but that tends not to last for too long arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thank you operator and well take the next question from mark devries with barclays please go ahead mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks just had a question about what youre seeing in the student lending space and one of your competitors has noted some headwinds in the quarter just how is that shaping up roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services so we feel pretty good about peak season volumes were up roughly yearoveryear and we believe that we gained share although were still sort of processing so clearly we saw one major competitor step back last year but were very excited about that market we underwrite it in a very disciplined way and its a great way to get a really good product in our brand in front of the next generation of prime cardholders discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay got it and then just a followup question on pulse as you know youve had some pretty strong volumes there roger is there a point at which you start to get some meaningful scale benefits and the earnings contribution from that becomes more meaningful and grows faster than the volumes roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services we would love to increase the percent of our earnings that comes out of the payments segment i think one of the challenges we also are working pretty hard to increase earnings from our banking segment so were not standing still there either while were excited about pulse its also very competitive were battling for routing at the merchant level with visa and mastercard day in day out weve seen a lot of growth from expanding from traditional pin debit to card not present and so thats been particularly helpful but yeah were very focused on growing that business mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay got it thank you operator and well take our next question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks maybe just to come back to the new account acquisition is there particularly in card is there a way to talk about either if there are any different channels that youre using or whats the nature of the consumer are there any differences in the type of consumer that youre seeing roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services not really moshe i dont think weve seen anything dramatic since prior to the pandemic clearly the continued migration to digital channels direct mail becomes a smaller and smaller piece but thats been a trend for many years now so we continually are finetuning the digital channels i guess what weve seen is a greater ability to measure the results of top of funnel spend as it shifts more digital when that spend moves from tv to even video thats online you can do a better job with tracking and attribution and so we are repositioning how we spend and thats one of the areas were leveraging some of our advanced analytics moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got you thank you and as you mentioned kind of using balance transfer as part of this can you talk a little bit about anything that you can share with us in terms of whether theyre all at zero are there some that are at yields above zero and any kind of update on what youve seen in terms of retention of those balances discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure so probably one of the bigger trends there was a real collapse in balance transfer demand during the pandemic clearly a lot of issuers were pulling back on credit line increases but i think consumers were much more focused on paying down their debt versus moving it around so you saw a softening in demand for personal loans and balance transfers thats starting to come back for us a lot of our acquisition offers are at the portfolio offers tend to either be above zero or have a fee that provides a pretty effective yield and as john pointed out for most of those we see a very high return from the balance transfer itself given this funding environment as well as a good percent sticking and thats something we model very carefully moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks very much operator and well take the next question from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer please go ahead dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc great thank you so much for taking my questions i guess if we just think about the comments around the economic outlook getting or the assumptions around your economic outlook becoming slightly worse from the second quarter to the third quarter but then being incrementally positive into credit trends can you just square those two pieces together john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah happy to dominick so when we modeled in the second quarter frankly the economy saw a higher level of gdp growth and employment returning to normalized levels sooner and when we updated those the gdp had come down employment returning to normalized levels pushed a bit so that was one of multiple inputs we provide that detail because its frankly the most transparent that people can take a look at to get a view of how were thinking about the reserves now the other items that are important in terms of our thinking here in the third quarter was first the portfolio performance and its been super strong second was the ending of many of the government support programs related to covid so most of those ended in august and september what wed like to do is see some seasoning of the impacts of those into the fourth quarter and perhaps even in the first quarter next year if what we expect is that the impact of that seasoning will be very very mild on the portfolio and the broad macros continue to look favorable theres enough kind of points of reference that would lead us to begin to step the reserves back to day one but a lot of things need to happen and we ended up where we were in the third quarter we ran through multiple models multiple scenarios and we got comfortable with where we were to make sure the balance sheet was fairly stated but we do see that the broad macros out into the future are positive so well see how they sustain and make a call in the fourth quarter and in discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc great thanks for that and if you all think about how the hierarchy of products that you have as well as across the consumer space for normalization on which products could normalize perhaps lets just i dont know to even maybe levels nco rates are there certain products you would expect to normalize either faster than other products or any color you can provide along the trajectory of one product versus the other given what youre seeing in your customer base would be awesome thank you so much john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thats a difficult thing to do in that it will be subject to the economic environment so we know historically right if theres a period of tougher financial situation the personal loans will be the ones that get the least priority in terms of payment credit cards tend to be high the student loans given the long duration of those contracts they dont seem to gyrate as much with the economic outputs plus that so much of our portfolio is cosigned that it provides additional coverage there so you get to kind of personal loans subject to the economic environment and then the card my sense is the card has been prioritized in terms of the payment hierarchy because of what has happened in terms of cash in the digital environment its really difficult to shop without a card these days so i look for stability there dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc great thanks so much i appreciate it operator and our final question will come from bill ryan with seaport research please go ahead bill ryan q analyst seaport global securities llc thank you and good morning a couple of questions one on the personal loans business i believe youve been in the business since a lot of new entrants in the marketplace today you kind of talked about it but as i remember twothird of your book is roughly from the existing discover credit card file but the other third historically coming from the other place out of market or out of your existing file as far as the underwriting youre seeing from the new entrants you kind of talked a little bit about it but i was wondering if you could take a little bit more granular approach to it and talk about are they making compromises relative to what youre willing to do on credit payment income yield verification all the above and second just kind of going back to the bonus accruals a lot of companies are stepping up bonuses as employee retention efforts is this something we should kind of view as transitory onetime or might this transfer into a little bit higher compensation expense going into next year thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah ill start with the bonus accrual we havent made any changes to our bonus program so to the extent there are changes in bonus accrual it just reflects far stronger financial performance this year versus last year than how that translates discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 in terms of the personal loan space it is very hard to get line of sight into the practices of these companies and there are many of them weve seen them come and go over multiple cycles in general i would say they tend to have fewer manual or laborintensive processes so id be surprised if they did the extent of employment verification we do and again it might be appropriate if their average ticket is lower they may have different return profiles the one thing i would say the vast majority lend to a much broader spectrum than we do and so we focus on the prime segment again primarily debt consolidation but it is hard to generalize across the many different new entrants that may have different models bill ryan q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thank you eric wasserstrom vice president head of investor relations discover financial services excellent well thank you all for joining us and if you have any further questions please reach
