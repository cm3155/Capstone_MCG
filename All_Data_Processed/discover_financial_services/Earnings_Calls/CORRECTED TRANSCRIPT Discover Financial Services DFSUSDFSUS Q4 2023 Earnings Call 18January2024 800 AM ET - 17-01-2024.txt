position discover well for and beyond with that ill now turn the call over to john greene who will review our fourth quarter financial results in more detail and provide some perspective on john t greene executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services thank you john and good morning everyone ill start with our summary financial results on slide in the quarter we reported net income of million down from just over billion in the prioryear quarter there are three broad trends to call out first we grew revenue reflecting loan growth partially offset by modest nim compression second provision expense grew by billion chargeoffs increased but landed at the low end of our expected range strong loan growth and higher delinquency drove the increase to our reserve balance finally expenses increased yearoveryear reflecting investments in compliance and risk management a reserve for customer remediation and higher marketing expense to support our national cashback debit campaign well get into the details of these topics on the following pages turning to slide our net interest margin ended the quarter at down basis points from the prior year and up basis points sequentially the decline from the prioryear quarter was driven by higher funding costs and higher interest chargeoffs which were partially offset by higher prime rates and increases in revolving balances for the full year net interest margin was up basis points from the prior year this margin performance reflects the improvement in our funding mix over the past several years and a reduced level of balance transfer and promotional balances as we tightened underwriting receivable growth remained robust card increased yearoveryear due to contributions from their prior year new account growth and a lower payment rate the payment rate declined about basis points from the sequential quarter and is now basis points above levels overall new account growth declined as a result of credit actions sales were up compared to the prior year quarter personal loans were up driven by continued strength in originations and lower payment rate versus the prior year student loans were flat yearoveryear as we prepare for a potential sale of this portfolio we will cease accepting applications for new loans on february our deposit business delivered outstanding performance in a challenging year average deposits were up yearoveryear and sequentially our directtoconsumer balances grew billion in the period and billion in the year discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 looking at other revenue on slide noninterest income increased million or this was primarily driven by an increase in loan fee income higher transaction processing revenue from our pulse business and higher net discount and interchange revenue our rewards rate was basis points in the period and basis points for the full year a decrease of basis points on a full year basis the decline reflects lower cashback match from slowing new account growth and our active management of our categories moving to expenses on slide total operating expenses were up million or yearoveryear and up from the prior quarter looking at our major expense categories compensation cost increased million or from higher head count marketing expenses increased million or professional fees were up driven by continued investment in compliance and risk management capabilities while other expense reflects a reserve for customer remediation moving to credit performance on slide total net chargeoffs were basis points higher than the prior year and up basis points from the prior quarter in card as anticipated delinquency formation is slowing as more recent vintages season we added a slide detailing some of the drivers of our credit performance in the appendix to the earnings presentation turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide this quarter we increased our reserves by million and our reserve rate increased by basis points to just over the increase in reserves was driven by receivable growth and higher nearterm loss content from higher delinquencies under cecl reserve levels increase as you approach peak losses we expect our losses to rise through the midyear and then plateau through the back half with some seasonal variation in terms of our macroeconomic outlook our view of unemployment was relatively unchanged while household net worth projections increased slightly these changes provided a small benefit to reserves looking at slide our common equity tier for the period was the sequential decline of basis points was driven largely by asset growth we declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock ph concluding on slide with our perspective on these exclude the impact of a potential student loan portfolio sale we expect endofperiod loan growth to be relatively flat while average loan growth will be up modestly yearoveryear we expect full year net interest margin to be to were currently anticipating four rate cuts of basis points in this is two more rate cuts than in our forecast in december each cut reduces nim by approximately basis points subject to a deposit beta we expect total operating expenses to increase by a midsingle digit percent this contemplates our expectation for compliancerelated cost to be approximately million this year total expenses may increase if incremental resources or remediation is required we expect net chargeoffs in the range of to finally regarding capital return we will participate in this years ccars process and believe the results should help inform our view of capital management for importantly our capital management priorities have not changed and remain centered on supporting organic growth and returning capital to shareholders to summarize we continue to generate solid financial results for we will continue to advance our compliance and risk management capabilities and investing in actions that drive sustainable longterm value creation with that ill turn the call back to our operator to open the line for qa discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from rick shane with jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning everybody and thanks for taking my questions the excuse me im a little under the weather today so i apologize the loan growth expectations is that organic loan growth or is that net of the portfolio sale of the student loans john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services hey rick john greene here that is organic loan growth so all of the guidance excluded the impact of a potential student loan asset sale richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats it from me thank you guys operator thank you our next question will come from moshe orenbuch with td cowen moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen great thanks john maybe just to followup on ricks question i mean given the strong growth that youre currently seeing in the personal loan business and the fact that youre still adding accounts albeit at a lower level in the credit card business you did mention kind of lower balance transfers but is there something else going on can you talk about kind of deconstruct that loan growth expectation for us a little bit john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services sure sure sure thanks moshe so the components of loan growth sales new account generation payment rate trend and so what were anticipating for sales given the slowdown through in terms of sales although we did have a pretty strong holiday season is that sales will be relatively flat yearoveryear new account generation relative to last year certainly down but overall positive new account growth and payment rate what weve tried to do here is kind of derisk the forecast so we assume that basis points of payment rate thats elevated versus will remain elevated so those three components reflect end up coming in and reflecting on our projections now loan growth could actually come in higher if payment rate continues to decline but overall our basis for guidance loan growth net interest margin and chargeoffs was to give a range and then also be relatively conservative in terms of the expectations on those ranges discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen great thanks and maybe just as a followup as a on the credit side i mean you did talk a month ago and then mentioned again today that you expect kind of losses to peak around the middle of the year how do we think about the performance after that peak i mean you said kind of flattish whats driving that why isnt that something that improves and how do we think about reserving in that context john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services sure yeah so theres a couple different components that are driving that so you go back in time we had about two years of unusually low chargeoffs and delinquencies from the pandemic and that process of normalization typically will take about the same amount of time two years the vintages and are seasoning and thats why we expect it to plateau the vintage actually was relatively large but too early to call whether its going to outperform our expectations but certainly a highly profitable vintage from our vantage point today so what youre actually just seeing is a period of normalization my expectation is that chargeoffs will plateau and then and beginning in i would expect those to step down now you will know from this past year and the prior year what weve tried to do in terms of the guidance is be conservative in terms of the range and throughout we tightened the range and actually came in at the low end so my hope is that well be able to do the same thing in moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen great thanks operator thank you our next question will come from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone john maybe to dig a little bit deeper on some of the commentary you gave regarding loan growth maybe just focusing on the account growth the market clearly thinks theres a better chance of a soft landing right now were seeing peers who are talking about mid to highsingle digit growth and im just curious on the account growth is this more just conservative underwriting are you trying to make sure that you make more progress on risk governance and compliance before you increase growth maybe just a little bit more color on why youre seeing such a slowdown in terms of the account growth relative to the last few years john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah thanks ryan so our approach in and then early into was that we took a look at underwriting and performance of what ill say buckets within our underwriting box and essentially tightened and weve tightened throughout what youre seeing here in terms of account growth at least projections today is us getting back to and levels as we continue to watch the and vintage perform and six months from now we may end up stepping in a little bit more aggressively but what we wanted to do certainly was let kind of get further confirmation that the delinquency trends that we have seen in terms of slowing discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 rate of delinquency formation continue to persist and that the chargeoffs the forecasted come in at or better than our expectations if those two factors are at play there will be an opportunity to be more aggressive in terms of new account growth ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and maybe as my followup can you maybe help us understand where you stand with the student loan sale and how would you foresee that impacting the outlook as well as capital return over the next four to six quarters thank you john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah thanks ryan so good news so it is actually progressing to schedule so matter of fact last evening we signed a servicing agreement with nelnet to become the servicer of this portfolio so that was great news it was a competitive process and certainly nelnet showed that theres a commitment to continue to dedicate resources and service that portfolio at a high level the next step will be to continue the servicing migration activities we expect those activities will take around six months were conservatively it may take a month or two longer and then as were doing that our advisor will begin to market the portfolio so our expectations are that it will sell in the second half and the implications for the business are as follows so theres billion of receivables that equates to kind of riskweighted assets of about billion we expect that that will be that the exit of that will be have a positive impact on net interest margin by somewhere between bps and bps on a full year basis chargeoff rate could tick up mildly so under bps and as of we had million of reserves so with a successful exit those reserves will drop and the sale price the market will determine that but we expect it to go above par ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thank you for all the color operator thank you our next question will come from mihir bhatia with bank of america mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi thank you for taking my question were going to start with loan growth also and i just want to go back to the building blocks a little bit i think you essentially said in terms of the building blocks youre expecting payments rates to be elevated ex the like flat to stay at this elevated level and sales to be flat youre also adding accounts so im just like trying to understand like i guess whats the ph bad side like how does loan growth stay flat given this year youre at im just trying to understand like well like theres some pieces im missing i feel like and im just trying to understand that thank you john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yes so let me try to give a little bit of color that hopefully gets folks comfortable with our view of loan growth today so in really really strong loan growth much of that was driven both by new account growth but also a slowing payment rate that payment rate in our assumptions is holding flat and as a result what we expect to discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 see is the vintage will begin to kind of build in terms of assets but theres likely going to be some impact from sales and then also as we cycle through the vintage were not expecting significant new balance builds from that vintage now maybe there will be but overall what weve tried to do here is reflect our view of our underwriting box today not reflect any potential openings of our underwriting box in the later part of and if we outdeliver on loan growth that will be fantastic the other element that has come into play here is we pulled back on balance transfers and promotional balances in the second part of we dont anticipate significantly increasing that level of balance transfer or promotional balances now if we do that will certainly be accretive to loan growth as well so what youre hearing in the guidance is that our expectation is that theres an opportunity to deliver better but certainly weve positioned both the guidance and the business to be conservative at least for the next quarter or two mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc got it and then i wanted to go back to the expenses and the reserve for customer remediation that you mentioned that you took this quarter can you just provide some color on that like is that related to the merchant mispricing issue how much was the reserve this quarter where does that leave the reserve overall i think it was million in but just trying to understand how has the estimate for the costs related to that issue changed i think you also mentioned it could be higher expenses could be higher in if you need to take more reserves there like where are we with that investigation just give us an update on that merchant mispricing issue too john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah yeah okay so let me start with the reserves and the remediation reserve that we put up so theyre unrelated so the merchant tiering reserve we booked million as a liability that has moved is now about million just as weve had some payments and other flows in through the interchange that we had to correct manually for so the progress there in terms of discussions with our merchants is positive we dont have enough data points to make a material change to that reserve level yet but its progressing my view positively through the end of the year and today as we speak now separately we put up million for a as we described it a customer remediation reserve now some context to that is as part of this compliance journey weve put in a significant number of resources to help us identify and correct issues and as we prepare the business to continue to move forward to drive organic growth were getting much much better at identifying the issues and we identify an issue what weve done here is if we think theres an theres a its appropriate to refund customer payments were going to do that so we identified a particular issue largely within servicing for our student loan business although there was a gentle impact in another business line we continue to look across our business but the lions share of that reserve relates to student loans and essentially what were doing is trying to position the business and that product for a successful exit mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc thank you thanks for taking my questions ill get back in queue discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 operator thank you our question will come from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning multipart question on the same topic and then a followup can you update us john on the progress made with the regulatory agencies i think that was sort of alluded to in the previous question but maybe just the firmness around capital return post ccar what exactly happens to the cfpb consent order when the loan servicing is transferred and then just curious the loan growth expectations was that any part driven by any regulatoryrelated matters ph thanks john john b owen a director interim chief executive officer president discover financial services yeah this is john owen i mean ill take part of that and john greene will take the capital part what i would tell you is over the last months or so weve made significant progress improving our risk management and compliance capabilities weve increased our investments on risk and compliance in to up to about a million level and as john mentioned earlier we think expense growth and that will be in the midsingle digits in line with other guidance weve given weve made improvements in risk and compliance but we still have quite a bit of work to do one thing id point out the fdic consent order which we did get and was made public it does not include the misclassification issue in that scope of work were working closely with our regulators on that topic and really dont have anything further to add on that topic at this point in time john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services okay sanjay i feel like your question is a fivepart question but well do our sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc sorry john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services best to answer it so the loan growth aspect that you asked it is completely unrelated to any regulatory issues so nothing to connect on that point in terms of capital return our commitment to capital return and capital allocation have not changed so first to invest in profitable organic growth and second to return excess capital to shareholders so as we kind of progressed through the fourth quarter we remained on pause with our buybacks and given weve got a new ceo coming in we are contending with a number of different compliance and risk management matters we got the merchant tiering reserve we dont have any feedback from our regulators on that point we decided that it would be most appropriate to remain conservative in terms of our guidance related to buyback we will go through ccars as i said in my prepared remarks that will form a view of capital under significant stress as it always does and then were going to have the exit or hopefully the exit from the student loan business which will provide free up at least billion worth of capital so what youre hearing here hopefully is some indications that one were committed to returning excess capital to shareholders two that there will be excess capital generated and available and three were going to go through a diligent process internally share it with our board and then take the boards direction in terms of buybacks discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc the consent order john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services and sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc with the loan servicing like does that move indiscernible john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services oh yeah oh yeah yeah that was part i think yes so that remains in effect and our chosen provider nelnet is fully aware of the consent order requirements in terms of kind of servicing excellence and they were chosen because theyve got a track record in terms of being able to kind of service a portfolio such as this and theyve dedicated both technology and resources to ensure a seamless transition sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay then my followup just question is sorry to my fivepart question is the reserve rate moshe sort of asked about it a little bit but how should we think about that reserve rate migrating over the course of the year given that the chargeoff rate plateaus does the reserve rates start coming down and where does it come down to in a normal environment im just trying to think about how we model that because thats really important john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah yeah thanks for that we are hoping that that question would come out so the let me talk about the reserves for the quarter and then ill give some perspective on and what could potentially happen there so we grew receivables in the quarter billion now some of that was transactor balances that are reserve light but one thing that weve been consistent on in terms of our communication is that as we approach peak losses reserve levels increase and what weve said previously is typically we hit the highest reserve rate level one to two quarters before peak losses so thats the path were on let me provide some details on some assumptions that were used to set the reserve levels this year at year end and then ill give a perspective on what could happen in so macros relatively benign so unemployment levels we ended the year at what weve assumed is an unemployment level of so a mild increase household net worth mild decrease savings rate mild increase and gdp to be in to be about so relatively conservative but not overly optimistic of assumptions now what will come into play in is obviously the macros which will continue to be important the portfolio performance and by the way it is tracking to our expectation with monthovermonth delinquency formation declining the credit quality of the book remains relatively consistent with what weve done historically so our discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 expectation is that assuming the macros remain consistent and the portfolio performance remains to our expectation that there will be some level of opportunity to reduce the reserve rate in now thats subject to a significant amount of governance and were going to make sure that we comply with our internal processes and generally accepted accounting principles so theyre my caveats but theres a lot of things that are different today than day one so the stepdown will be aligned with those points i just mentioned sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you very much operator thank you our next question will come from bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning and thanks for taking my questions john john i wanted to followup on your credit commentary given that it is such an important area of focus for investors so youve been saying all along that you didnt move down the credit spectrum but the concern for many investors had been that other card issuers also experienced outsized growth as we emerged from covid and they had also experienced some normalization headwinds but they were now starting to see delinquency reformation start to roll over as discovers dq rate formations as recently as prior months data showed that your formations remain on and up until the right trajectory so i guess the question is does the new disclosure on slide confirm that your delinquency rate formations are indeed now also starting to roll over and if so does that really just reinforce your confidence that we could see peak ncos hit in all else equal john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yes and thanks for your question bill so just to give you kind of the benefit of some data here from september through december this year so the 30plus day delinquencies have declined monthovermonth so in september we peaked at an increase monthovermonth of bps what we said in the fourth quarter is we expected that to decline our october formation increased bps so relative to decline to the prior month november bps december bps and our expectation is that that will continue to decline but where it becomes negative were not going to get into that because it will be subject to a number of different things including kind of our origination path and broad macro so to get to the essence of your question we do have a level of confidence regarding kind of whats happening in the portfolio and the trend and as we progress in that will be reflected in hopefully tightening guidance and then also tightening guidance to the lower end and then also hopefully reserve rate changes bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful thank you and following up on your expense commentary i believe you said that expenses may need to increase further potentially maybe if you could frame the possibility of there being what you would view discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 as another step function higher from here or how should we think about the risk of further increase in expenses and how are we how should we think about your sustainable longterm efficiency ratio i think as we look at historically discover has been very very much had lowest efficiency ratio in the industry to what extent is that still something that we can expect john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services okay yeah thanks bill so our expectation is that the longterm efficiency ratio will be sub40 so theres still a view that that will happen the reason we put what ill call is the caveat in the expense guidance was a number of different institutions when theyve been on this compliance and risk management journey have not been able to call what the actual compliance and risk management spend would be we had that remediation reserve in the fourth quarter there were some indications that we might have to put something up for that but we didnt know theres still some level of unknowns unknowns and i wanted to make sure were clear to the people listening to this call that there is some level of risk to the expense guidance now that said on our expense base is a significant amount of dollars we feel like we have nearly a full complement of resources around risk and compliance today which is good news our issues management capabilities significantly improved our path to improving overall governance is certainly on the right trajectory so those factors give me confidence that were not going to have a huge surprise but there could be just we just dont have enough certainty given where we are on our compliance journey now the rest of the cost base theres a couple of things to keep in mind here so right today we have nearly resources dedicated to risk and compliance management a significant amount of those resources are dedicated to issues related to student loan servicing which with a successful exit and transfer it will give us an opportunity to scrutinize the cost base in a different way so thats certainly on the list of planned activities for the second quarter third quarter and then hopefully we begin some execution in the fourth quarter so overall i feel comfortable with the expense guidance that weve provided and were going to do our best to make sure that every dollar we spend is wise and that the shareholders get the benefit from that bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thank you for taking my questions john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services youre welcome bill thanks operator thank you our next question will come from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning regarding the new million remediation charge did all of that remediation relate to the student loan business specifically and was that in part tied also to the july disclosure around the student loan issues that surfaced then and did any of that million relate to the other business that you point that you mentioned that could have had a tangential impact and what was that business thanks discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yes so the million was related to servicing issues the lions share of that the significant share of that was related to student loans there was a small amount that we put up related to personal loans upon reviewing that there may be an opportunity to release that reserve very small though the million is not connected to the issues that we discussed in july so but what i tried to do is provide as much context as i could so weve dedicated a number of resources to identifying issues to help us on this consumer compliance journey as with any company as youve dedicated resources they come up to speed they are going to get more effective at identifying issues and correcting issues this is symptomatic of that progress so weve got folks that are combing through every single bit of our business to make sure were executing consumer compliance at a high level an issue was found crossfunctional team reviewed it and we made an election that we are going to accrue something at yearend to cover potential remediation payments john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay and just related to that so this is a newer issue versus what was discussed in july and is it also newer versus what is in your existing consent order tied to student loans john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah so what we disclosed in july was a ph broad program around risk and compliance management activities the specifics of the particular issues werent discussed in any details and what ive shared with you right now is probably as much information as im going to share at this point so the takeaway should be is that were progressing on the risk and compliance management activities were getting better at identifying issues when we find an issue were going to deal with it and we found an issue weve put up a reserve for that issue and were going to work through further details on it in order to ensure that consumer compliance is where we want it to be so with that i think ill probably close this particular item out if you dont mind john pancari q analyst evercore isi no thats fine thank you for that and my last and its a very quick one on the loan growth guidance you guided to average balances for up modestly can you help maybe quantify the up modestly john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah john pancari q analyst evercore isi if you could if you could really help frame it thanks john b owen a director interim chief executive officer president discover financial services yeah so to on average discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks john operator thank you our next question comes from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc john its good to see the delinquency formation showing some progress can you talk about laterstage delinquency rates i mean they seem like theyre still going up on a yearoveryear basis like how are cure rates im still trying to get my arms around this like potentially nco rate it just seems high for discover john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah yeah the laterstage buckets are kind of modestly improving so were seeing improvements across every bucket the first bucket is really the key one and then as you get into later and later buckets the ability to cure just becomes more challenging because the situation that a consumer is in but we are seeing kind of mild improvements there so that also is encouraging donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and the vintage can you talk a little bit about what your early read is on that john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah the net of it is that its early so its performing profitably and were going to continue to keep our eye on it donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc so does that mean its not really trending that well relative to your expectations or is it kind of in line john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services no no i didnt say that its just its early so its performing generally in line with expectations donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks operator thank you well take our next question from jeff adelson with morgan stanley jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 hi thanks for taking my questions john i just wanted to kind of follow up on the chargeoff guide i know youve mentioned that youre hopeful this could come in at the low end but could you maybe just dive into what would take us to the low versus the high end here and if this delinquency formation slowing continues throughout the year is that kind of whats embedded in your expectation at getting at the low end here john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah thank you yes so our baseline is that its going to come in at the low end now i shared the information in terms of the macros that we use for reserves pretty consistent in terms of what we used for our what ill say the second half view of chargeoffs so what could make that worse certainly change to the macros a some servicing issues which highly unlikely or a miss in terms of forecasting im comfortable with our forecasting team im comfortable with our servicing team and weve got a number of programs and weve dedicated a lot of dollars in terms of analytics in terms of call frequency and best time to call and weve worked on our call scripts to ensure theyre compliant but also effective in terms of prioritizing payments so i feel good about that so the range just reflects a level of kind of broad uncertainty that were going to tighten jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and just as my followup on as we think about the nim guide this year i know you mentioned youre embedding an expectation of four rate cuts if i think about where nim exited the year though it feels like the range of rate cuts using your basis points for every basis points it seems like theres more rate cut thats embedded in there can you maybe just help us understand the drivers is there may be a little bit more interest accrual reversal going on and maybe help us understand what youre assuming in deposit betas on the way down is it going to be a little bit slower than what weve seen in the last four rate cuts on the way up john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yes so good question so let me start off with and then the fourth quarter of so as a business my view is great execution in terms of being able to kind of manage net interest margin so yearoveryear were up i think were an outlier and thats from that standpoint in financial services what we saw in the fourth quarter was cost of funding increased as lower rate cds term out and higher rate cds would come in our osa rate remains competitive and the expectation on beta is that it will be in the mid in a declining rate and i hope that the beta on the declining rate is higher also something thats not baked into the elements of the guidance but certainly with the exit of student loans or the proposed exit from the student loan business thats going to throw a lot of liquidity back into the business that will give us an opportunity to be slightly more aggressive in terms of deposit pricing again that will be a second half activity so the four rate cuts that weve put into the baseline assumption again two more than what we had forecasted in december could be as many as six which if it is that will certainly impact deposit betas and deposit pricing and consequentially net interest margin so the guide here i think is appropriate perhaps a little conservative and our baseline expectation is that were going to deliver to the upper end of the guidance range jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 okay thank you for taking my questions john operator thank you well take our next question from terry ma with barclays terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc hey thanks good morning maybe just want to touch on the loan growth guide for a little bit aside from the balance transfers and promos how much control do you actually have on growth going from loan growth to just seems like a hard pivot to me so maybe can you just talk a little bit more about that then my second question is just what needs to happen before you can actually grow again and is there a way to think about what that growth rate looks like as we look out toward and beyond thank you john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services okay thanks terry so i think its important to take a look at the quarterly trends on loan growth versus the total year because each quarter what you will see is that the amount of loan growth decreased quarteroverquarter and that was partly due to payment rate partly due to underwriting standards and partly due to kind of sales activity slowing as well so in weve guided to loan growth to be flat again payment rate is basis points higher than it was in that could be a positive if it holds where it ended the year its not going to impact loan growth so i feel like what weve tried to do here is put something on the table thats reasonable that doesnt reflect a level of undue risktaking in a time where consumer behavior is actually changing relatively dynamically if you think back twoandahalf years ago coming out of the pandemic to kind of where it is today and also the impact of inflation that hit certainly all consumers but certainly in terms of our prime revolver consumers the lower third of those consumers were impacted fairly significantly by inflation so we do want to kind of watch as i said previously watch delinquency formations and our other metrics before we press on the gas on generating a high level of new accounts in terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc thanks and is there a way to think about what growth would look like before when you reaccelerate john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah i would go back to kind of historical growth rate the companys typically delivered somewhere between and yearoveryear growth and then we feel like our underwriting and credit and the opportunity to lend profitably at a rate higher than that we will do that so what an important thing for our investors to remember is we seek to generate high returns over the short mid and longterm and thats essentially what this plan is seeking to deliver eric wasserstrom a senior vice president corporate strategy and development investor relations discover financial services so todd discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc ph okay thank you eric wasserstrom a senior vice president corporate strategy and development investor relations discover financial services i think we have time for one more please operator thank you sir well go next to john hecht with jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc morning guys thanks for taking my question and i know youve answered a lot on credit so i apologize for one more but your and chargeoff levels were in the low3 range and i think we weve all kind of said that was a good environment but a relatively normal environment youre guiding toward a high relatively higher closer to chargeoff rate this year despite low unemployment i know you kind of called out the vintage is something to think about there but maybe can you talk about the attribution of the different the difference in chargeoff rates between that period and now i think the kind of the reason for the question is just to give us a sort of level of understanding of where we are in the credit cycle and give us comfort that things will stabilize if not improve from here john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah yeah happy to john so a few points so were in a significantly different environment today than we were back in and so were coming off of two years of abnormally low losses so sub2 we had an incredibly high payment rate in going back two years ago that has normalized what were seeing is that consumers had significant amount of savings those savings levels have been depleted you had a spending pattern with the consumers across the board that was reflecting kind of pentup demand and as savings rate came down the consumers needed to adjust their spending patterns some did successfully some did not and then youre also seeing inflation if you go back a yearandahalf to two years ago inflation significantly outpacing wage growth and that put certainly the lower quartile of the consumers in a significant amount of stress and thats across all sectors of the economy so not specifically to our prime revolver segment and on top of that you also had in and two very large vintages and so you put all those together what naturally is going to happen is youre going to have chargeoffs what ill say is peak before they normalize back to levels that youre accustomed to seeing from discover so my sense is that given real wage growth our consumers will end up in frankly a better spot in and than they were in and and our chargeoff forecast and reserves reflect a view that the consumers will manage through this and delinquency formation will continue to slow so anyway i hope that hopefully this color is helpful john hecht q analyst jefferies llc yeah thats super helpful and im maybe could you give us a sense of the chargeoffs by product or maybe like the is the mix going to be consistent with historical mix just to give us a sense from a modeling perspective discover financial services dfs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah the only piece of information im going to give is in the fourth quarter we expect student loan chargeoffs to be significantly lower because were exiting john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thank you eric
