factors business competition business supervision and regulation and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on s policy changes and forecasting uncertainties given the same information others may reach different reasonable estimates the key assumptions requiring significant judgment in the allowance for credit losses estimate on a quarterly basis include determination of the lengths of the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods as well as the macroeconomic variables selected for use in loss forecast models the lengths of the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods can vary and are subject to a quarterly assessment that considers the economic outlook and level of variability among macroeconomic forecasts generally a straightline method is used to revert from the reasonable and supportable forecast period to the postreversion period the specific macroeconomic variables most significant to the loss forecast models may change over time but generally include measures of consumer indebtedness unemployment personal income and housingrelated metrics the overall economic environment directly impacts both the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods as well as the macroeconomic variables that are used in the loss forecast models if management used different assumptions about the economic environment in estimating expected credit losses the impact to the allowance for credit losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in addition if we experience a rapidly changing economic environment as experienced recently under the covid19 pandemic the uncertainty around the credit loss forecasts may increase both due to the uncertainty of the economic forecasts and the challenges our models may have in incorporating them although the estimation process is broader than any single macroeconomic variable some variables have a more significant impact on the allowance for credit losses estimate one example is that a basis point change in the consumer installment credit total outstanding macroeconomic variable holding all other variables constant could move the card allowance for credit losses estimate by approximately million see loan quality and note loan receivables to

incurred loss approach net interest income the table that follows this section has been provided to supplement the discussion below and provide further analysis of net interest income and net interest margin net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on our interestearning assets and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets we analyze net interest income in total by calculating net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average total loan receivables and net yield on interestearning assets net interest income as a percentage of average total interestearning assets we also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources along with the income generated by our liquidity portfolio on net interest income our interestearning assets consist of i cash and cash equivalents primarily related to amounts on deposit with the federal reserve bank of philadelphia ii restricted cash iii other shortterm investments iv investment securities and v loan receivables our interestbearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits both directtoconsumer and brokered and longterm borrowings including amounts owed to securitization investors net interest income is influenced by the following the level and composition of loan receivables including the proportion of credit card loans to other loans as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates the credit performance of our loans particularly with regard to chargeoffs of finance charges which reduce interest income the terms of longterm borrowings and certificates of deposit upon

our liquidity portfolio and interestbearing liabilities changes in the interest rate environment including the levels of interest rates and the relationships among interest rate indices such as the prime rate the federal funds rate interest rate on excess reserves and libor and the effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program net interest income increased for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in primarily driven by loan growth and lower funding costs partially offset by lower yields on credit card loans interest income increased during the three months ended march as compared to the same period in as a result of continued loan growth offset by lower yields resulting from lower average market rates interest expense decreased

other loans total loan receivables allowance for credit losses net loan receivables prior to adoption of asu no on january credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach provision and allowance for credit losses provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimate of credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables at each period end date in deriving the estimate of expected credit losses we consider the collectibility of principal interest and fees associated with our loan receivables we also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously charged off or are expected to be charged off establishing the estimate for expected losses requires significant management judgment the factors that influence the provision for credit losses include increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances including changes in consumer spending payment and credit utilization behaviors the level of originations and maturities and changes in the overall mix of accounts and products within the portfolio the credit quality of the loan portfolio which reflects among other factors our credit granting practices and the effectiveness of collection efforts the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer including national and regional conditions unemployment levels bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements the level and direction of historical losses and regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance for more details on how we estimate the allowance for credit losses refer to critical accounting estimates allowance for credit losses on loan receivables and note loan receivables to our condensed

march prior to adoption of asu no on january credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach represents the adjustment to allowance for credit losses as a result of adoption of asu no on january excludes a million release of the liability for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments for the three months ended march as the liability is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition prior to adoption of asu no on january net chargeoffs on pcd loans generally did not result in a charge to earnings net change in reserves on pcd pools having no remaining nonaccretable difference prior to adoption of asu no on january the allowance for credit losses was billion at march which reflects a billion build over the amount of the allowance for credit losses at december the allowance build across all loan products was due to a billion cumulativeeffect adjustment for the adoption of cecl on january and a billion build during the quarter that in addition to the impact of life of loan reserving under cecl primarily reflects an economic outlook that included the covid19 pandemic in estimating the allowance at march we used a macroeconomic forecast that assumes the unemployment rate rising to more than recovering through and gross domestic product falling at an annualized rate in the first half of the year the estimate also contemplated the impact of government stimulus programs on borrower payment behavior at adoption of cecl t he forecast period management deemed to be reasonable and supportable was months this period decreased to months at march due to the uncertainty caused by the rapidly changing economic environment due to the covid19 pandemic for both periods the reversion period was months and a straightline method was used to revert to appropriate historical information the provision for credit losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net chargeoffs in the period and the required amount of allowance for credit losses at the balance sheet date for the three months ended march the provision for credit losses increased by billion or as compared to the same period in the allowance build was determined under separate methodologies for each period based on the timing of the adoption of asu no on january however the largest driver of the increase in provision between the two periods was the significant change in economic outlook due to the covid19 pandemic net chargeoffs our net chargeoffs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude chargedoff and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses chargedoff and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income respectively which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses while fraud losses are recorded in other expense the following table presents amounts and rates of net chargeoffs of key loan products dollars in millions for the three months ended march credit card loans private student loans personal loans prior to adoption of asu no on january net chargeoffs on pcd loans generally did not result in a charge to earnings the net chargeoff rate on our credit card loans increased for the three months ended march when compared to the same period in due to seasoning of continued loan growth the net chargeoff rate on our private student loans remained relatively flat for the three months ended march when compared to the same period in the net chargeoff rate on our personal loans decreased for the three months ended march when compared to the same period in due to improved underwriting delinquencies delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time a loan balance is considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become days past due the following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of key loan products that are and days or more delinquent loans that are not accruing interest regardless of delinquency and loans restructured in tdr programs dollars in millions march december loans or more days delinquent credit card loans private student loans personal loans loans or more days delinquent credit card loans private student loans personal loans loans not accruing interest loans restructured in tdr programs credit card loans currently enrolled no longer enrolled total credit card loans private student loans personal loans includes pcd loans for all periods presented we estimate that interest income recognized on credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million and million for the three months ended march and respectively we do not separately track interest income on loans in tdr programs this amount was estimated by applying an average interest rate to the average loans in the various tdr programs we estimate that the gross interest income that would have been recorded in accordance with the original terms of credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million and million for the three months ended march and respectively we do not separately track the amount of additional gross interest income that would have been recorded if the loans in tdr programs had not been restructured and interest had instead been recorded in accordance with the original terms this amount was estimated by applying the difference between the average interest rate earned on nonmodified loans and the average interest rate earned on loans in the tdr programs to the average loans in the tdr programs credit card loans restructured in tdr programs include million and million at march and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent beginning in credit card accounts of borrowers that have previously participated in a temporary interest rate reduction program and that have both demonstrated financial stability and had their charging privileges reinstated at a marketbased interest rate are no longer included in the balance of tdrs private student loans restructured in tdr programs include million and million at march and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent personal loans restructured in tdr programs include million and million at march and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent the day delinquency rate for credit card loans as well as the 90day delinquency rates for private student and personal loans at march remained relatively flat c ompared to december the 90day delinquency rate for credit card loans at march increased c ompared to december due to seasoning of continued loan growth the 30day delinquency rate for private student loans at march decreased c ompared to december primarily due to seasonality of the loan portfolio the 30day delinquency rate for personal loans at march decreased c ompared to december as a result of improved underwriting the balance of credit card loans reported as tdrs decreased at march as compared to december primarily because of a change starting in related to loans no longer enrolled credit card accounts of borrowers that have previously participated in a temporary interest rate reduction program and that have both demonstrated financial stability and had their charging privileges reinstated at a marketbased interest rate are no longer included in the balance of tdrs the balance of private student and personal loans reported as tdrs increased at march as compared to december due to seasoning of continued loan growth and improved awareness of programs available to assist borrowers having difficulties meeting payment obligations we plan to continue to use tdr programs as we believe they are useful in assisting customers experiencing financial difficulties and allowing them to make timely payments see note loan receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further description of our use of tdr programs to provide relief to customers experiencing financial hardship modified and restructured loans for information regarding modified and restructured loans see delinquencies and note loan receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements other income the following table presents the components of other income dollars in millions for the three months ended march vs decrease increase discount and interchange revenue net protection products revenue loan fee income transaction processing revenue gains on equity investments other income total other income net of rewards including cashback bonus rewards of million and million for the three months ended march and respectively total other income increased for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in which was primarily due to gains on equity investments and loan fee income partially offset by a decrease in net discount and interchange revenue gains on equity investments increased primarily from a sale during the quarter loan fee income was higher as a result of an increase in late fees net d iscount and interchange revenue decreased as a result of higher promotional rewards which was partially offset by increased sales volume other expense the following table represents the components of other expense dollars in millions for the three months ended march vs increase employee compensation and benefits marketing and business development information processing and communications professional fees premises and equipment other expense total other expense total other expense increased for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in the increase was primarily driven by higher employee compensation and benefits marketing and business development and professional fees employee compensation and benefits increased as a result of higher average salaries the increase in marketing and business development was driven by higher brand advertising targeting card growth professional fees was higher primarily driven by an increase in collection fees income tax expense the following table presents the calculation of the effective income tax rate dollars in millions except effective income tax rate for the three months ended march loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense effective income tax rate the income tax expense decreased million for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in due to a pretax loss for the current period the effective tax rate was relatively flat for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in the effective rate for three months ended march was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain tax matters liquidity and capital resources impact of covid19 on liquidity and capital financial market volatility increased sharply during march as market participants came to anticipate a sudden and deep economic contraction caused by measures to arrest the spread of the covid19 virus financial markets experienced a flight to quality as yields on safe haven assets such as us treasury notes fell rapidly while corporate credit spreads widened materially wide credit spreads and high market volatility impaired access to and increased the indicative cost of some wholesale funding channels for a period of time particularly before the federal reserve announced unconventional lending support programs such as the term assetbacked securities loan facility we entered the covid19 pandemic with strong capital and liquidity positions sized to allow us to maintain normal operations during extended periods of financial market stress and disruptions to wholesale and retail funding sources our reserves of highquality liquid assets and access to diverse funding channels allowed us to refrain from issuing debt in disrupted wholesale funding markets and avoid higher funding costs moreover our directtoconsumer and sweep deposit balances increased during march as investors sought safe haven assets consequently our store of liquid assets increased as the pandemic progressed we plan to maintain a prudent liquid asset buffer particularly so long as heightened uncertainty around the macroeconomic and financial operating environment persists we remain wellcapitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and took prudent actions to preserve capital when the macroeconomic and operating environment turned uncertain of note we suspended our plans to purchase shares of our common stock during the second quarter and took actions to reduce our exposures to higherrisk segments of our credit portfolio we have completed numerous stress tests to assess the impact of a severe economic downturn on our capital and liquidity and maintain sufficient amounts of both to ensure we remain wellcapitalized and funded while continuing to serve our customers and extend special accommodations to those who need it funding and liquidity we seek to maintain stable diversified and costeffective funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under both normal operating conditions and periods of economic or financial stress in managing our liquidity risk we seek to maintain a prudent liability maturity profile and ready access to an ample store of primary and contingent liquidity sources our primary funding sources include directtoconsumer and brokered deposits public term assetbacked securitizations and other shortterm and longterm borrowings our primary liquidity sources include a liquidity portfolio comprised of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities and borrowing capacity through private term assetbacked securitizations in addition we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides another source of contingent liquidity funding sources deposits we offer deposit products to customers through two channels i through direct marketing internet origination and affinity relationships directtoconsumer deposits and ii indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms brokered deposits directtoconsumer deposits include online savings accounts certificates of deposit money market accounts ira certificates of deposit and checking accounts while brokered deposits include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts at march we had billion of directtoconsumer deposits and billion of brokered and other deposits credit card securitization financing we securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding we access the assetbacked securitization market using the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent through which we issue dcent discoverseries notes in both public and private transactions from time to time we may add credit card receivables to these trusts to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing sellers interest we retain significant exposure to the performance of trust assets through holdings of the sellers interest and subordinated security classes of dcent at march we had billion of outstanding public assetbacked securities and billion of outstanding subordinated assetbacked securities that had been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities we refer to this as economic early amortization which is based on excess spread levels excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period including interest collections fees and interchange exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period including interest expense servicing fees and chargedoff receivables in the event of an economic early amortization which would occur if the excess spread fell below on a threemonth rolling average basis we would be required to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received by the trust for the three months ended march the discoverseries threemonth rolling average excess spread was the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received through our whollyowned indirect subsidiary discover funding llc we are required to maintain a contractual minimum level of receivables in the trust in excess of the face value of outstanding investors interests this excess is referred to as the minimum sellers interest the required minimum sellers interest in the pool of trust receivables which is included in credit card loan receivables restricted for securitization investors is set at approximately in excess of the total investors interests which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us if the level of receivables in the trust were to fall below the required minimum we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables which would increase the amount of credit card loan receivables restricted for securitization investors a decline in the amount of the excess sellers interest could occur if balance repayments and chargeoffs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors interests sellers interest is impacted by seasonality as higher balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter if we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum sellers interest requirement an early amortization or repayment of investors interests would be triggered an early amortization event would impair our liquidity and may require us to utilize our available nonsecuritization related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources which may or may not be available at the time we have several strategies we can depl oy to prevent an early amortization event one strategy is that we could add additional receivables to the trust which would reduce our available borrowing capacity through the federal reserve discount window as of march there were billion of credit card receivables in the trust and n o accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the three months ended march another strategy is that we could employ structured discounting which was used effectively in to bolster excess spread and mitigate any risk of early amortization the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in credit card securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries dollars in millions at march total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years after five years scheduled maturities of longterm borrowings owed to credit card securitization investors the triplea rating of dcent class a notes issued to date has been based in part on an fdic rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the fdic as conservator or receiver will not using its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous gaap although the implementation of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic transfers and servicing no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment the fdic approved a final rule that preserved the safeharbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts including dcmt so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original fdic safe harbor if evaluated under gaap pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to december other legislative and regulatory developments may however impact our ability andor desire to issue assetbacked securities in the future other longterm borrowingsstudent loans at march million of remaining principal balance was outstanding on securitized debt assumed as part of our acquisition of the student loan corporation principal and interest payments on the underlying student loans will reduce the balance of these secured borrowings over time other longterm borrowings corporate and bank debt the following table provides a summary of discover financial services parent company and discover bank outstanding fixedrate debt dollars in millions at march principal amount outstanding discover financial services parent company fixedrate senior notes maturing discover financial services parent company fixedrate retail notes maturing discover bank fixedrate senior bank notes maturing discover bank fixedrate subordinated bank notes maturing certain discover financial services senior notes require us to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade shortterm borrowings as part of our regular funding strategy we may from time to time borrow shortterm funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase repo market through repurchase agreements federal funds are shortterm unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a federal reserve account funds borrowed in the repo market are shortterm collateralized loans usually secured with highlyrated investment securities such as us treasury bills or notes or federal agency mortgage bonds or debentures at march there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or repurchase agreements additional funding sources private assetbacked securitizations we have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed assetbacked securitizations at march we had total committed capacity of billion none of which was drawn while we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source therefore we reserve some undrawn capacity informed by our liquidity stress test results for potential contingency funding needs we also seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates renewing them approximately one year prior to their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them for operational testing purposes and seasonal funding needs federal reserve discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphias discount window as of march discover bank had billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged primarily consumer loans we have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingent liquidity funding uses our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit primarily through discover bank the purchase of investment securities for our liquidity portfolio working capital and debt and capital service we assess funding uses and liquidity needs under stressed and normal operating conditions considering primary uses of funding such as onbalance sheet loans and contingent uses of funding such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions in order to anticipate funding needs under stress we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic systemic and hybrid idiosyncratic and systemic scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets including those for securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt may be affected by the credit ratings of dfs discover bank and the securitization trusts downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations as well as higher collateral enhancement requirements for both our public and private asset securitizations in addition to increased funding costs deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets in light of the covid19 pandemic rating agencies have cited their expectation that the banking industry will experience heightened loan delinquencies and chargeoffs as the labor market weakens for instance on march moodys changed its outlook on the us banking system from stable to negative and on april assigned a negative outlook to the credit card industry for similar considerations on april fitch affirmed our credit ratings bbbbbb for senior unsecured debt but changed the outlook on those ratings from stable to negative the outlook for securities issued by dcent remained stable a rating outlook reflects an agencys opinion regarding the likely rating direction over the medium termoften a period of about a yearbut also indicates the agencys belief that the issuers credit profile is consistent with its current rating level at that point in time we also maintain agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain provisions that require dfs and discover bank to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified major credit rating agencies at march discover banks credit rating met specified thresholds set by its counterparties however if its credit ratings were to fall below investment grade discover bank would be required to post additional collateral which as of march would have been million dfs parent company had no outstanding derivatives as of march and therefore no collateral was required the table below reflects our current credit ratings and outlooks moodys investors service standard poors fitch ratings

agency identification for structured finance product ratings a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating liquidity we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions in addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section we also maintain highly liquid unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or outright sales we maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business the policy is approved by the board of directors with implementation responsibilities delegated to the asset and liability management committee the alco additionally we maintain a liquidity management framework document which outlines the general strategies objectives and principles we utilize to manage our liquidity position and the various liquidity risks inherent in our business model we seek to balance the tradeoffs between maintaining too much liquidity which may be costly with having too little liquidity which could cause financial distress liquidity risk is centrally managed by the alco which is chaired by our treasurer and has crossfunctional membership the alco monitors the liquidity risk profiles of dfs and discover bank and oversees any actions corporate treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet current and projected needs in addition the alco and our board of directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at dfs and discover bank which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our board of directors we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we utilize early warning indicators ewis to detect the initial phases of liquidity stress events and a reporting and escalation process that is designed to be consistent with regulatory guidance the ewis include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures and are monitored on a daily basis and reported to the alco regularly a warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decisionmaking by our senior management team and in certain instances may lead to the convening of a seniorlevel response team and activation of our contingency funding plan in addition we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls we evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed in accordance with regulatory requirements including idiosyncratic systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs these scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at dfs and discover bank across a range of time horizons by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingent liquidity our primary contingent liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity in addition we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides an additional source of contingent liquidity we seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least months in a severe stress environment in such an environment we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity at march our liquidity portfolio is comprised of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities cash and cash equivalents were primarily in the form of deposits with the federal reserve investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the us treasury and residential mortgagebacked securities issued by us government housing agencies or governmentsponsored enterprises these investments are considered highly liquid and we expect to have the ability to raise cash by selling them utilizing repurchase agreements or pledging certain of these investments to access secured funding the size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the size of our balance sheet as well as operational requirements market conditions and interest rate risk management strategies for example we may alter the composition of our liquidity portfolio to mitigate the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates at march our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities were billion which was billion higher than the balance at december during the three months ended march the average balance of our liquidity portfolio was billion march december  in millions liquidity portfolio cash and cash equivalents investment securities total liquidity portfolio private assetbacked securitizations primary liquidity sources federal reserve discount window total liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities cash in the process of settlement and restricted cash are excluded from cash and cash equivalents for liquidity purposes excludes million and million of us treasury securities that have been pledged as swap collateral in lieu of cash as of march and december respectively see additional funding sources for additional information bank holding company liquidity the primary uses of funds at the unconsolidated dfs level include debt service obligations interest payments and return of principal and capital service and management activities which include dividend payments on capital instruments and the periodic repurchase of shares of our common stock our primary sources of funds at the bank holding company level include the proceeds from the issuance of unsecured debt and capital securities as well as dividends from our subsidiaries particularly discover bank under periods of idiosyncratic or systemic stress
