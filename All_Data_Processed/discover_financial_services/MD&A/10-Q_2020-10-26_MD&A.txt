of this quarterly report and in risk factors business competition business supervision and regulation and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on s policy changes and forecasting uncertainties given the same information others may reach different reasonable estimates the key assumptions requiring significant judgment in the allowance for credit losses estimate on a quarterly basis include determination of the lengths of the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods as well as the macroeconomic variables selected for use in loss forecast models the lengths of the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods can vary and are subject to a quarterly assessment that considers the economic outlook and level of variability among macroeconomic forecasts generally a straightline method is used to revert from the reasonable and supportable forecast period to the postreversion period but in certain stressed scenarios a weighted approach may be deemed more appropriate the specific macroeconomic variables most significant to the loss forecast models may change over time but generally include measures of consumer indebtedness unemployment personal income and housingrelated metrics the overall economic environment directly impacts both the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods as well as the macroeconomic variables that are used in the loss forecast models if management used different assumptions about the economic environment in estimating expected credit losses the impact to the allowance for credit losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in addition if we experience a rapidly changing economic environment as experienced recently under the covid19 pandemic the uncertainty around the credit loss forecasts may increase both due to the uncertainty of the economic forecasts and the challenges our models may have in incorporating them see loan quality and note loan receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further details about our allowance for credit

margin net interest income as a percentage of average total loan receivables and net yield on interestearning assets net interest income as a percentage of average total interestearning assets we also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources along with the income generated by our liquidity portfolio on net interest income our interestearning assets consist of i cash and cash equivalents primarily related to amounts on deposit with the federal reserve bank of philadelphia ii restricted cash iii other shortterm investments iv investment securities and v loan receivables our interestbearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits both directtoconsumer and brokered and longterm borrowings including amounts owed to securitization investors net interest income is influenced by the following the level and composition of loan receivables including the proportion of credit card loans to other loans as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates the credit performance of our loans

rate interest rate on excess reserves and london interbank offered rate libor and the effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program net interest income decreased for the three and nine months ended september as compared to the same periods in primarily driven by lower yields on credit card loans partially offset by lower funding costs interest income decreased during the three and nine months ended september as compared to the same periods in primarily as a result of lower yields on credit card loans which was the result of lower market rates interest

growth during the first three quarters of while we continue to lend to customers we have tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts across all products in response to the pandemic we expanded borrower relief offerings to included skipapay payment deferral programs and other loan modifications complementing the assistance already available through our existing loan modification programs the accounts using these modifications as a result of the pandemic impact were evaluated for exclusion from tdr status either due to the insignificance of the concession or because they qualified for exemption pursuant to the cares act while we continue to support and provide assistance to all customers impacted by covid19 we are no longer offering enrollments in the skipapay payment deferral programs or loan modifications developed specifically for covid19 as of august while the skipapay payment deferral programs were active we enrolled approximately thousand customers and billion in receivables in total the utilization of these skipapay payment deferral programs had a favorable impact on reported credit performance because pursuant to regulatory guidelines accounts enrolled in the programs did not advance through delinquency cycles in the same time frame as would have occurred without the programs specifically current accounts enrolled in the programs did not advance to delinquency and delinquent accounts enrolled in the programs did not advance to the next delinquency cycle or to chargeoff our delinquency ratios have been favorably impacted at september as compared to december by customer usage of the skipapay payment deferral programs additionally due to relief provided by the cares act certain customer accounts entering loan modification programs during the pandemic were excluded from being reported as tdrs as a result fewer modifications were reported as tdrs at september than otherwise would have been the table below reflects both the new modifications reported as tdrs and the amount of new modifications excluded from tdr classification as a result of regulatory relief dollars in millions for the nine months ended september accounts that entered a program and were classified as tdrs during the period accounts excluded from the tdr designation due to regulatory exemptions number of accounts balances number of accounts balances credit card loans private student loans personal loans despite the lower delinquency and tdr trends resulting from the relief we are providing to our customers we believe we have appropriately reflected the risk presented by the accounts using these programs as well as the worsening economic impact of the pandemic on our customers in the allowance for credit losses since the adoption of cecl on january the increases in the allowance for credit losses during the first three quarters of are indicative of the deterioration in consumer credit we expect related to the pandemic the yeartodate build in the allowance of billion which includes the billion cumulativeeffect adjustment for the adoption of cecl is largely attributable to card loans but includes increases associated with all loan products labor markets historically indicative of trends in credit losses have been significantly stressed by the pandemic with unemployment reaching unprecedented levels the higher allowance for credit losses reflects our view of this economic impact on our customers refer to note loan receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more details on modification programs tdrs and the allowance for credit losses loan receivables consist of the following dollars in millions september december credit card loans other loans private student loans personal loans other total other loans total loan receivables allowance for credit losses net loan receivables prior to adoption of asu no on january credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach provision and allowance for credit losses provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimate of credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables at each period end date in deriving the estimate of expected credit losses we consider the collectability of principal interest and fees associated with our loan receivables we also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously charged off or are expected to be charged off establishing the estimate for expected losses requires significant management judgment the factors that influence the provision for credit losses include increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances including changes in consumer spending payment and credit utilization behaviors the level of originations and maturities and changes in the overall mix of accounts and products within the portfolio the credit quality of the loan portfolio which reflects among other factors our credit granting practices and the effectiveness of collection efforts the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer including national and regional conditions unemployment levels bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements the level and direction of historical losses and regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance for more details on how we estimate the allowance for credit losses refer to critical accounting estimates allowance for credit losses on loan receivables and note loan receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements the following tables provide changes in our allowance for credit losses dollars in millions for the three months ended september credit card student loans

loans other total balance at december additions provision for credit losses deductions chargeoffs recoveries net chargeoffs other balance at september excludes a million build and million build of the liability for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments for the three months and nine months ended september respectively as the liability is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition prior to adoption of asu no on january credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach prior to adoption of asu no on january net chargeoffs on pcd loans generally did not result in a charge to earnings represents the adjustment to allowance for credit losses as a result of adoption of asu no on january net change in reserves on pcd pools having no remaining nonaccretable difference prior to adoption of asu no on january the allowance for credit losses was billion at september the allowance reflects a billion build over the amount of the allowance for credit losses at december and was essentially flat compared to the amount of the allowance for credit losses at june the allowance build across all loan products was due to i a billion cumulativeeffect adjustment for the adoption of cecl on january and ii a billion build during the period that primarily reflects an economic outlook with updated assumptions about the impact of the covid19 pandemic in estimating the allowance at september we used a macroeconomic forecast that projected slight improvement from prior quarter including a peak unemployment rate of which remained flat through the end of and recovers slowly over the next few years we also considered the uncertainties associated with some of the assumptions used in that macroeconomic forecast including the amount and timing of additional government stimulus furthermore the estimate contemplated the impact of previous government stimulus programs and other companyinitiated loan modification programs on borrower payment trends the impact of covid19 on the economy has continued to cause uncertainty in assumptions surrounding factors such as length and depth of economic stresses and longer term impacts on borrower behavior which has required significant management judgment in estimating the allowance for credit losses the forecast period management deemed to be reasonable and supportable was months for all periods since the adoption of cecl except for the estimate as of march the decrease to months as of march was due to the uncertainty caused by the rapidly changing economic environment resulting from the covid19 pandemic the return to an 18month reasonable and supportable forecast period was based on the view that the present macroeconomic conditions will last for a longer period than previously expected the reversion period was months for all quarters since the adoption of cecl during the first quarter of a straightline method was used to revert to appropriate historical information in the second quarter of the high degree of economic stress led us to apply a weighted reversion method for credit card loans that puts more emphasis on the loss forecast model rather than lower historical losses for similar reasons we determined it was appropriate to apply a weighted reversion method for all loans in the third quarter the provision for credit losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net chargeoffs in the period and the required amount of allowance for credit losses at the balance sheet date for the three and nine months ended september the provision for credit losses decreased by million or and increased billion or respectively as compared to the same periods in the allowance build was determined under separate methodologies for each period based on the timing of the adoption of asu no on january however the largest driver of the increase in provision between the two periods was the significant change in economic outlook due to the covid19 pandemic net chargeoffs our net chargeoffs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude chargedoff and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses chargedoff and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income respectively which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses while fraud losses are recorded in other expense the following table presents amounts and rates of net chargeoffs of key loan products dollars in millions for the three months ended september for the nine months ended september credit card loans private student loans personal loans prior to adoption of asu no on january net chargeoffs on pcd loans generally did not result in a charge to earnings the net chargeoff rate on our credit card loans increased for the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in due to lower receivable balances and seasoning of recent years loan growth respectively the net chargeoff rate on our private student loans was essentially flat for the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in the net chargeoff rate on our personal loans decreased for the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in due to improved underwriting delinquencies delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time a loan balance is considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become days past due the following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of key loan products that are and days or more delinquent loans that are not accruing interest regardless of delinquency and loans restructured in tdr programs dollars in millions september december loans or more days delinquent credit card loans private student loans personal loans loans or more days delinquent credit card loans private student loans personal loans loans not accruing interest loans restructured in tdr programs credit card loans currently enrolled no longer enrolled total credit card loans private student loans personal loans includes pcd loans for all periods presented we estimate that interest income recognized on credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million and million for the three months ended september and respectively and million and million for the nine months ended september and respectively we do not separately track interest income on loans in tdr programs this amount was estimated by applying an average interest rate to the average loans in the various tdr programs we estimate that the gross interest income that would have been recorded in accordance with the original terms of credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million and million for the three months ended september and respectively and million and million for the nine months ended september and respectively we do not separately track the amount of additional gross interest income that would have been recorded if the loans in tdr programs had not been restructured and interest had instead been recorded in accordance with the original terms this amount was estimated by applying the difference between the average interest rate earned on nonmodified loans and the average interest rate earned on loans in the tdr programs to the average loans in the tdr programs credit card loans restructured in tdr programs include million and million at september and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent private student loans restructured in tdr programs include million and million at september and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent personal loans restructured in tdr programs include million and million at september and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent the 30day as well as 90day delinquency rates for credit card loans at september decreased compared to december primarily due to the impact of changing consumer spending and savings patterns and the skipapay payment deferral relief programs the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for private student loans at september decreased compared to december primarily due to seasonality of the loan portfolio the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for personal loans at september decreased compared to december as a result of improved underwriting the balance of credit card loans reported as tdrs decreased at september as compared to december primarily due to customer usage in programs subject to tdr exclusion in accordance with the cares act as well as the exclusion of customer accounts that had previously been classified as tdr for which the account has been returned to a market interest rate and the customer has demonstrated financial stability the balance of personal loans reported as tdrs at september as compared to december was essentially flat the balance of private student reported as tdrs increased at september as compared to december due to continued loan growth and improved awareness of programs available to assist borrowers having difficulties making payment obligations we plan to continue to use tdr programs as we believe they are useful in assisting customers experiencing financial difficulties and allowing them to make timely payments see note loan receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further description of our use of tdr programs to provide relief to customers experiencing financial hardship modified and restructured loans for information regarding modified and restructured loans see delinquencies impact of covid19 on

of other income dollars in millions for the three months ended september vs decrease increase for the nine months ended september vs decrease increase discount and interchange revenue net protection products revenue loan fee income transaction processing revenue gains on equity investments other income total other income net of rewards including cashback bonus rewards of million and million for the three months ended september and respectively and billion for the nine months ended september and total other income decreased for the three and nine months ended september as compared to the same periods in primarily due to a decrease in discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income the decrease in total other income was partially offset by an increase in gain on equity investments for the nine months ended september the decrease in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by a decrease in rewards costs both of which were the result of lower sales volume due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic loan fee income decreased due to lower volume and late fees late fees decreased as a result of lower delinquencies as we continue to work with our customers through the economic stresses from covid19 gain on equity investments increased primarily from sales of investments during the first and second quarters other expense the following table represents the components of other expense dollars in millions for the three months ended september vs increase decrease for the nine months ended september vs increase decrease employee compensation and benefits marketing and business development information processing and communications professional fees premises and equipment other expense total other expense total other expense decreased for the three months ended september as compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily driven by marketing and business development and professional fees marketing and business development decreased due to covid19 related expense reductions in brand advertising for card professional fees were lower primarily driven by a decrease in collection fees this was offset by an increase in employee compensation and benefits due to higher average salaries total other expense increased for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in the increase was primarily driven by employee compensation and benefits a covid19 related noncash impairment charge included in other expense on the diners club business in the second quarter and information processing and communications employee compensation and benefits increased as a result of a larger headcount base and higher average salaries the impairment charge was triggered by changes in the international travel and entertainment businesses and a declining revenue outlook for the foreseeable future resulting from covid19 the increase in information processing and communications was due to investments in infrastructure this was offset by a decrease in marketing costs due to covid19 related expense reductions in brand advertising for card income tax expense the following table presents the calculation of the effective income tax rate dollars in millions except effective income tax rate for the three months ended september for the nine months ended september income before income taxes income tax expense effective income tax rate income tax expense decreased million and million for the three and nine months ended september respectively as compared to the same periods in income tax expense and the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended september are lower due to lower projected pretax income for the full year we calculate our provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to pretax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items as we are projecting lower pretax income for the full year the impact of certain favorable items such as tax credits on the effective tax rate is amplified thereby resulting in a fullyear effective tax rate that is lower than the historical annual effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended september and respectively the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain tax matters liquidity and capital resources impact of covid19 on liquidity and capital we entered the covid19 pandemic in march with strong capital and liquidity positions sized to allow us to maintain normal operations during extended periods of financial market stress and disruptions to wholesale and retail funding sources our reserves of highquality liquid assets and access to diverse funding channels allowed us to refrain from issuing debt while certain wholesale funding markets experienced disruptions and wider credit spreads particularly during the second quarter moreover our directtoconsumer and sweep deposit balances increased substantially during the second and third quarters as investors sought safehaven assets consequently our store of cash and other liquid assets has increased materially since the onset of the pandemic thus curtailing our need for wholesale funding we plan to maintain a prudent liquid asset buffer particularly so long as heightened uncertainty around the macroeconomic and financial operating environment persists we remain wellcapitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and took prudent actions to preserve and augment our capital when the macroeconomic and operating environment turned uncertain of note we suspended our plans to purchase shares of our common stock took actions to reduce our exposures to higherrisk segments of our credit portfolio and issued preferred stock during the second quarter we have completed numerous stress tests to assess the impact of a severe economic downturn on our capital and liquidity and maintain ample amounts of both to ensure we remain wellcapitalized and funded while continuing to serve our customers and extend special accommodations to those who need it funding and liquidity we seek to maintain stable diversified and costeffective funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under both normal operating conditions and periods of economic or financial stress in managing our liquidity risk we seek to maintain a prudent liability maturity profile and ready access to an ample store of primary and contingent liquidity sources our primary funding sources include directtoconsumer and brokered deposits public term assetbacked securitizations and other shortterm and longterm borrowings our primary liquidity sources include a liquidity portfolio comprised of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents short term investments and investment securities and borrowing capacity through private term assetbacked securitizations in addition we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides another source of contingent liquidity during september in an initiative for one of discover banks lending businesses we entered into a shortterm securities lending transaction with a counterparty as part of the transaction we lent billion of us treasury bills and securities to the counterparty and received agency passthrough residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs as collateral from the borrower see note investments to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the securities lending transaction funding sources deposits we offer deposit products to customers through two channels i through direct marketing internet origination and affinity relationships directtoconsumer deposits and ii indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms brokered deposits directtoconsumer deposits include online savings accounts certificates of deposit money market accounts ira certificates of deposit and checking accounts while brokered deposits include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts at september we had billion of directtoconsumer deposits and billion of brokered and other deposits credit card securitization financing we securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding we access the assetbacked securitization market using the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent through which we issue dcent discoverseries notes in both public and private transactions from time to time we may add credit card receivables to these trusts to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing sellers interest we retain significant exposure to the performance of trust assets through holdings of the sellers interest and subordinated security classes of dcent at september we had billion of outstanding public assetbacked securities and billion of outstanding subordinated assetbacked securities that had been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities we refer to this as economic early amortization which is based on excess spread levels excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period including interest collections fees and interchange exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period including interest expense servicing fees and chargedoff receivables in the event of an economic early amortization which would occur if the excess spread fell below on a threemonth rolling average basis we would be required to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received by the trust for the three months ended september the discoverseries threemonth rolling average excess spread was the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received through our whollyowned indirect subsidiary discover funding llc we are required to maintain a contractual minimum level of receivables in the trust in excess of the face value of outstanding investors interests this excess is referred to as the minimum sellers interest the required minimum sellers interest in the pool of trust receivables which is included in credit card loan receivables restricted for securitization investors is set at approximately in excess of the total investors interests which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us if the level of receivables in the trust were to fall below the required minimum we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables which would increase the amount of credit card loan receivables restricted for securitization investors a decline in the amount of the excess sellers interest could occur if balance repayments and chargeoffs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors interests sellers interest is impacted by seasonality as higher balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter if we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum sellers interest requirement an early amortization or repayment of investors interests would be triggered an early amortization event would impair our liquidity and may require us to utilize our available nonsecuritization related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources which may or may not be available at the time we have several strategies we can deploy to prevent an early amortization event for instance we could add additional receivables to the trust which would reduce our available borrowing capacity at the federal reserve discount window as of september there were billion of credit card receivables in the trust and no accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the three and nine months ended september alternatively we could employ structured discounting which was used effectively in to bolster excess spread and mitigate early amortization risk the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in credit card securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries dollars in millions at september total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years after five years scheduled maturities of longterm borrowings owed to credit card securitization investors the triplea rating of dcent class a notes issued to date has been based in part on an fdic rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the fdic as conservator or receiver will not use its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous gaap although the implementation of the fasb accounting standards codification topic transfers and servicing no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment the fdic approved a final rule that preserved the safeharbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts including dcmt so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original fdic safe harbor if evaluated under gaap pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to december other legislative and regulatory developments may however impact our ability or desire to issue assetbacked securities in the future other longterm borrowingsstudent loans at september million of remaining principal balance was outstanding on securitized debt assumed as part of our acquisition of the student loan corporation principal and interest payments on the underlying student loans will reduce the balance of these secured borrowings over time other longterm borrowingscorporate and bank debt the following table provides a summary of discover financial services parent company and discover bank outstanding fixedrate debt dollars in millions at september principal amount

notes maturing discover bank fixedrate subordinated bank notes maturing certain discover financial services senior notes require us to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade shortterm borrowings as part of our regular funding strategy we may from time to time borrow shortterm funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase repo market through repurchase agreements federal funds are shortterm unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a federal reserve account funds borrowed in the repo market are shortterm collateralized loans usually secured with highlyrated investment securities such as us treasury bills or notes or federal agency mortgage bonds or debentures at september there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or repurchase agreements as noted above during september we entered into a shortterm securities lending transaction as part of the transaction we lent billion of us treasury bills and securities to the counterparty and received agency passthrough rmbs as collateral from the borrower to reflect the obligation to return the rmbs collateral we recognized billion in shortterm borrowings which are recorded within the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as of september we will release the rmbs when the securities lending transaction matures in november see note investments to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the securities lending transaction additional funding sources private assetbacked securitizations we have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed assetbacked securitizations at september we had total committed capacity of billion none of which was drawn while we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source therefore we reserve some undrawn capacity informed by our liquidity stress test results for potential contingency funding needs we also seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates renewing them approximately one year prior to their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them for operational testing purposes and seasonal funding needs federal reserve discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphias discount window as of september discover bank had billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged primarily consumer loans we have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingent liquidity funding uses our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit primarily through discover bank the purchase of investments for our liquidity portfolio working capital and debt and capital service we assess funding uses and liquidity needs under stressed and normal operating conditions considering primary uses of funding such as onbalance sheet loans and contingent uses of funding such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions in order to anticipate funding needs under stress we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic systemic and hybrid idiosyncratic and systemic scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets including those for securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt may be affected by the credit ratings of dfs discover bank and the securitization trusts downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations as well as higher collateral enhancement requirements for both our public and private asset securitizations in addition to increased funding costs deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we also maintain agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain provisions that require dfs and discover bank to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified major credit rating agencies at september discover banks credit rating met specified thresholds set by its counterparties however if its credit rating was to fall below investment grade discover bank would be required to post additional collateral

seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions in addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section we also maintain highly liquid unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or outright sales we maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business the policy is approved by the board of directors with implementation responsibilities delegated to the asset and liability management committee the alco additionally we maintain a liquidity management framework document which outlines the general strategies objectives and principles we utilize to manage our liquidity position and the various liquidity risks inherent in our business model we seek to balance the tradeoffs between maintaining too much liquidity which may be costly with having too little liquidity which could cause financial distress liquidity risk is centrally managed by the alco which is chaired by our treasurer and has crossfunctional membership the alco monitors the liquidity risk profiles of dfs and discover bank and oversees any actions corporate treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet current and projected needs in addition the alco and our board of directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at dfs and discover bank which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our board of directors we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we utilize early warning indicators ewis to detect emerging liquidity stress events and a reporting and escalation process that is designed to be consistent with regulatory guidance the ewis include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures and are monitored on a daily basis and reported to the alco regularly a warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decisionmaking by our senior management team and in certain instances may lead to the convening of a seniorlevel response team and activation of our contingency funding plan in addition we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls we evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed in accordance with regulatory requirements including idiosyncratic systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs these scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at dfs and discover bank across a range of time horizons by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingent liquidity our primary contingent liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity in addition we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides an additional source of contingent liquidity we seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least months in a severe stress environment in such an environment we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity at september our liquidity portfolio is comprised of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and investment securities cash and cash equivalents were primarily in the form of deposits with the federal reserve and treasury bills shortterm investments were primarily comprised of treasury bills with contractual maturities greater than days but less than one year at the time of acquisition investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the us treasury and rmbs issued by us government housing agencies or governmentsponsored enterprises these investments are considered highly liquid and we expect to have the ability to raise cash by selling them utilizing repurchase agreements or pledging certain of these investments to access secured funding the size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the size of our balance sheet as well as operational requirements market conditions and interest rate risk management strategies for instance our liquidity portfolio has grown materially during this year as our customer deposits increased and our loan balances declined reflecting consumers response to the covid19 pandemic at september our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities were billion which was billion higher than the balance at december during the three and nine months ended september the average balance of our liquidity portfolio was billion and billion respectively september december  in millions liquidity portfolio cash and cash equivalents

collateral as of september and december respectively see additional funding sources for additional information capital our primary sources of capital are the earnings generated by our businesses and the proceeds from issuances of capital securities we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the growth and risks of our businesses and to meet regulatory requirements rating agency targets and debt investor expectations within these constraints we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders the level composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the federal reserve and the fdic dfs along with discover bank must maintain minimum levels of capital failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial position and operating results we must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory guidance and regulations current or future legislative or regulatory reforms such as the implementation of cecl may require us to hold more capital or adversely impact our capital level we consider the potential impacts of these reforms in managing our capital position dfs and discover bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that became effective january under final rules issued by the federal reserve and the fdic to implement the provisions under the basel committees december framework basel iii rules the basel iii rules require dfs and discover bank to maintain minimum riskbased capital and leverage ratios and define what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios under basel iii rules for regulatory capital dfs and discover bank are classified as standardized approach entities defined as us banking organizations with consolidated total assets over billion but not exceeding billion and consolidated total onbalance sheet foreign exposures less than billion as of january thresholds within the basel iii rules were fully phased in with the exception of certain transition provisions that were frozen pursuant to regulation issued in november pursuant to a final rule issued in july the transition provisions that were previously frozen have been replaced with new permanent thresholds as discussed below additionally on march federal bank regulatory agencies announced an interim final rule which has since been adopted as a final rule that allows banks that have implemented cecl the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital followed by a threeyear transition period for purposes of calculating regulatory capital we have elected to defer recognition of the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital for two years in accordance with the final rule after that period of deferral the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital will be phased in over a threeyear period beginning in we estimate that electing this option raises our common equity tier cet1 capital ratios in for additional information regarding the riskbased capital and leverage ratios see note capital adequacy to our condensed consolidated financial statements on march the federal reserve announced the scb final rule which would impose limitations on our capital distributions if we do not maintain our capital ratios above stated regulatory minimum ratios based on the results of supervisory stress tests we participated in the ccar supervisory stress test this year and received our scb of which primarily reflects the difference between our actual cet1 ratio as of the fourth quarter of and our projected minimum cet1 ratio based on the federal reserves models in its ninequarter severely adverse stress scenario the scb became effective october under this rule we will be required to assess if our planned capital actions are consistent with the effective capital distributions limitations that will apply on a proforma basis throughout the planning horizon see regulatory environment and developments banking capital standards and stress testing for additional information the basel iii rules provide for certain thresholdbased deductions from and adjustments to cet1 to the extent that any one such category or all such categories in the aggregate exceed certain percentages of cet1 in july federal banking regulators issued a final rule that among other things revised certain capital requirements for standardized approach banks by raising the of cet1 deduction threshold for certain items to and eliminating the combined deduction threshold applying to these items these changes became effective for all standardized approach banking institutions in april basel iii rules also require disclosures relating to market discipline this series of
