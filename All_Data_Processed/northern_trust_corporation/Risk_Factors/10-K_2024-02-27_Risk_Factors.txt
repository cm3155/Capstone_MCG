item risk factors in the normal course of our business activities we are exposed to a variety of risks the following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to northern trust although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business financial condition or results of operations you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as reducing the price of our common stock and other securities reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients counterparties andor applicable regulators have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the cost at which we are able to do so additional risks beyond those discussed below elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could affect us adversely further we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face and you should not interpret discussion of any risk to imply that such risk has not already materialized these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10k forwardlooking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under forwardlooking statements included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations table start annual report northern trust corporation table end summary our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by various risk types and considerations including market risks operational risks credit risks liquidity risks regulatory and legal risks strategic risks and other risks including as a result of the following market risks we are dependent on feebased business for a majority of our revenues which may be affected adversely by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively changes in the monetary trade and other policies of various regulatory authorities central banks governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty in the global economy including the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively operational risks many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively we are highly dependent on information technology systems and networks many of which are operated by third parties and any failures of or disruptions to our or such third parties technological systems or networks could materially and adversely affect our business breaches of our security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattacks or other information security incidents may result in losses errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways our dependence on technology and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure exposes us to risks that also can result in losses a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations failure of any of our thirdparty vendors or their vendors to perform can result in losses we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively pandemics natural disasters global climate change acts of terrorism geopolitical tensions and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations credit risks failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings market volatility andor weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss liquidity risks if we do not manage our liquidity effectively our business could suffer if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations we may need to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity adversely table start annual report northern trust corporation table end regulatory and legal risks failure to comply with regulations andor supervisory expectations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings we are subject to extensive and evolving government regulation and supervision that impacts our operations changes by the us and other governments to laws regulations and policies applicable to the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make regulatory compliance more difficult and costly we are subject to complex and evolving laws regulations rules standards and contractual obligations regarding data privacy and security which could increase the cost of doing business compliance risks and potential liability we may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilities we may be impacted adversely by supervisory andor regulatory enforcement matters we may fail to set aside adequate reserves for or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to pending and threatened claims with a negative effect on our earnings the ultimate impact on us of regulatory divergence between the united kingdom and the european union remains uncertain if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could affect our earnings negatively strategic risks if we are not able to attract retain and motivate personnel our business could be negatively affected if we do not develop and execute strategic plans successfully our growth may be impacted negatively we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue we need to invest in innovation constantly and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings may affect our businesses and earnings negatively our success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings our operations businesses and clients could be materially adversely affected by the effects of climate change or concerns related thereto other risks the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are inherently limited may not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we face changes in tax laws and interpretations and challenges to our tax positions may affect our earnings negatively changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements our ability to return capital to stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by us banking laws and regulations applicable provisions of delaware law or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt table start annual report northern trust corporation table end market risks we are dependent on feebased business for a majority of our revenues which may be affected adversely by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences our principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management custody or administration the volume of transactions processed securities lending volume and spreads fees for other services rendered and in certain businesses fees calculated as a percentage of our clients earnings all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences for example downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debtrelated investments resulting from market disruption illiquidity or other factors historically have reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impacted our earnings negatively further although we do not hold invest in or custody cryptocurrency assets the markets in which they trade are highly volatile and volatility in these markets may impact the markets for other assets that we hold invest in or custody which could also impact our fees or financial condition market volatility andor weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide our earnings also may be affected by poor investment returns or changes in investment preferences driven by factors beyond market volatility or weak economic conditions poor absolute or relative investment performance in funds or client accounts that we manage or in investment products that we design or provide may result in declines in the market values of portfolios that we manage andor administer and may affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients for example from time to time in the past outflows from certain of our products driven by relative investment performance or other factors adversely impacted our overall fees derived from assets that we manage broader changes in investment preferences that lead to less investment in mutual funds or other collective funds such as the shift in investor preference to lower fee products could also impact our earnings negatively changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings interest rate changes could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities in response to rising inflation the federal reserve board increased interest rates from historically low levels during and while a rising interest rate environment generally has a positive effect on our net interest margin in some circumstances a rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively for example the rapid increases in interest rates during and adversely impacted the value of certain of our investment securities with resultant impacts on our capital liquidity and earnings additionally higher interest rates historically have caused and may in the future cause market volatility and downturns in equity markets resulting in a decrease in the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impact our earnings negatively our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments resulting in increased credit costs provisions for loan and lease losses and chargeoffs reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity resulting in lower performance yields and fees or higher funding costs conversely lowinterestrate environments generally result in a compressed net interest margin and also have a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products for example in the past we waived certain fees associated with money market funds due to the low level of shortterm interest rates low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earnings although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective which could impact earnings negatively please see market risk in the risk management section included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face changes in the monetary trade and other policies of various regulatory authorities central banks governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively the monetary trade and other policies of us and international governments agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on economic conditions and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the us through quantitative tightening andor easing and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing and play a role in contributing to or moderating levels of inflation all of which meaningfully impact our earnings further their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us changes in monetary trade and other governmental policies are beyond our table start annual report northern trust corporation table end control and can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business financial condition or results of operations macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty in the global economy including the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings risks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world foreign market and economic disruptions have affected and may in the future affect consumer confidence levels and spending international trade policy personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt and home prices additionally financial markets may be adversely affected by the liquidity or capital deficiencies actual or perceived of financial institutions and related industry and government actions current or anticipated impact of military conflict including the continuing military conflicts involving ukraine and the russian federation and israel and hamas and other evolving events in the middle east terrorism political or civil unrest public health epidemics or pandemics the exit or potential exit of one or more countries from the eu sovereign debt downgrades or debt crises or other geopolitical events for example developments related to the us federal debt ceiling including the possibility of a government shutdown default by the us government on its debt obligations or related creditrating downgrades could have adverse effects on the broader economy disrupt access to capital markets and contribute to or worsen an economic recession the cumulative effect of uncertain business conditions or economic challenges faced in various foreign markets including fiscal or monetary concerns economic downturns and the possibility of a recession in some jurisdictions other economic factors including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and changes to tax laws or the application or enforcement practices of such laws or volatility or lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business financial condition and results of operations declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion and our loan portfolio represents a smaller proportion of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio which is generally determined based upon market values available from thirdparty sources have fluctuated and may continue in the future to fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions for example in and again in early we realized notable losses on the sale of available for sale securities and we may realize additional losses in the future declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital liquidity and to the extent we realize losses earnings although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks including hedgingrelated strategies those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks accordingly market risks have from time to time negatively affected the value of securities held in our investment portfolio and in the future we could suffer additional adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings we provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods we also are exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investments in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks including hedgingrelated strategies any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively please see market risk in the risk management section included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively in past periods reductions in the volatility of currencytrading markets the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively in certain of our businesses such as securities lending our fee is calculated as a percentage of our clients earnings such that market and other factors that reduce our clients earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues table start annual report northern trust corporation table end operational risks many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk our risk management program may not be effective in all cases factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size scale and scope some or all of which may be exacerbated by the trend toward hybrid and remote working arrangements in recent years include failures of technological systems or networks or breaches of security measures including but not limited to those resulting from computer viruses cyberattacks or other information security incidents human errors or omissions including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems breakdowns in processes and internal controls overreliance on manual processes and controls which are less scalable than automated processes and controls failures of the systems and facilities that support our operations failure of any thirdparty vendor to properly execute the processes on which northern trust relies unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades defects in product design or delivery difficulty in accurately pricing assets which can be aggravated by market volatility and illiquidity and lack of reliable pricing from thirdparty vendors negative developments in relationships with key counterparties thirdparty vendors employees or associates in our daytoday operations and external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control such as pandemics geopolitical events political or social unrest natural disasters or acts of terrorism while we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively we also may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businessesparticularly as our geographic footprint product pipeline and client needs and expectations evolveand consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion if our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully such factors may have a negative impact on our business including operational resilience financial condition or results of operations in addition an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand the inherent risk in our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions we continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate for our role as a major financial institution nonetheless if we fail to provide the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk our business could be impacted adversely please see other risks in this risk factors section for further description of risks associated with the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks we are highly dependent on information technology systems and networks many of which are operated by third parties and any failures of or disruptions to our or such third parties technological systems or networks could materially and adversely affect our business our business is dependent on our and third parties information technology systems and networks any failure interruption or breach in the security of any such systems or networks could severely disrupt our operations and could subject us to liability claims harm our reputation interrupt our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additionally our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems including those that we outsource to providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities the third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business table start annual report northern trust corporation table end our business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system network or operational failure or disruption breaches of our security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattacks or other information security incidents may result in losses our systems involve the storage transmission and other processing of clients and our personal proprietary confidential and sensitive information and security breaches including cyberattacks or other information security incidents could expose us to a risk of theft loss destruction gathering monitoring dissemination misappropriation misuse alteration or unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to this information despite our implementation of a variety of security measures our computer systems networks and data including clients or our personal proprietary confidential and sensitive information could be subject to cyberattacks or other information security incidents such as among other things from physical and electronic breakins or unauthorized tampering malware and computer virus attacks ransomware attacks social engineering attacks including phishing attacks or denialofservice attacks our security measures also may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error failure of our controls with respect to access to our systems malfeasance or otherwise any failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations and could subject us to liability claims harm our reputation interrupt our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations data privacy and security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the evolving proliferation of new technologies the use of internetbased solutions mobile devices and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and rapidly evolving techniques of hackers terrorists organized crime and other external parties including foreign state actors and statesponsored actors any of which may see their effectiveness enhanced by the use of artificial intelligence data privacy and security risks also may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties or may result from human error software bugs server malfunctions software or hardware failure or other technological failure if we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure effective data privacy and security relative to the type size and complexity of our operations we could become more vulnerable to cyberattacks and other information security incidents and consequently subject to significant regulatory penalties and reputational damage also like many large enterprises the trend in the past several years toward a hybrid work environment that includes a combination of inoffice and remote work creates a broader attack surface for and potential vulnerabilities from cyber threats while we generally conduct security assessments on thirdparty vendors we cannot be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other information security incident some of our vendors may store or have access to our data and may not have effective controls processes or practices to protect our information from loss unauthorized disclosure unauthorized use or misappropriation cyberattacks or other information security incidents in addition our clients often use personal devices such as computers smart phones and tablets which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft as well as third parties with whom they share information used for authentication to access our systems and networks and manage their accounts which may heighten the risk of system failures interruptions or security breaches moreover the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and networks and prevent cyberattacks or other information security incidents could disrupt our operations or the operations of our or their service providers and result in misappropriation corruption or loss of personal confidential proprietary or other sensitive information or the inability to conduct ordinary business operations in addition there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available a vulnerability in our service providers software or systems a failure of our service providers safeguards policies or procedures or a cyberattack or other information security incident affecting any of these third parties could harm our business in recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private information and reputational harm we and our clients have been and expect to continue to be subject to a wide variety of cyberattacks and other similar threats including computer viruses ransomware and other malicious code distributed denialofservice attacks and phishing and vishing attacks and it is possible that we could suffer material losses resulting from a breach because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems and networks change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques to implement adequate preventative measures or to address them until they are discovered in addition successful cyberattacks may persist for an extended period of time before being detected because any investigation of an information security incident would be inherently unpredictable the extent of a particular information security incident and the path of investigating the incident may not be immediately clear it may take a significant amount of time before such an table start annual report northern trust corporation table end investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while such an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated and communication to the public regulators clients and other stakeholders may be inaccurate any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of an information security incident we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings related to information security incidents including regulatory investigations and other legal actions carrying the potential for damages fines sanctions or other penalties injunctive relief requiring costly compliance measures and reputational damage further the market perception of the effectiveness of our information security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients in conjunction with security incidents each of which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a breach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our business an event that results in the loss of information also may require us to reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services which could be costly and have a negative impact on our business and reputation although we maintain insurance coverage in the event of information theft damage or destruction from cyberattacks or other information security incidents there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies that the amount of insurance will be adequate to cover such losses that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all or that our insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim further even if not directed at us attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system or on our counterparties could affect directly or indirectly aspects of our business errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways in our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses further remote working and other modified business practices initiated in recent years combined with the increasing sophistication and frequency of potential cyberattacks and other information security incidents have heightened our operational and execution risk given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected our dependence on technology and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure exposes us to risks that also can result in losses our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure both internal and external to record and process among other things a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data in many currencies on a daily basis across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations combined with the increasing sophistication and frequency of potential cyberattacks and other information security incidents we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure upgrading replacing and modernizing these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation integration and security risks that could cause financial reputational and operational harm in recent years there has been an acceleration in the transition from traditional to digital financial services and heightened customer expectations in this area and this transition may require us to invest greater resources in technological advancements failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or networks or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations the failure to respond properly to and invest in changes and advancements in technology andor to compete for and retain employees with the necessary technical skills and expertise could limit our ability to attract and retain clients prevent us from offering products and services comparable to those offered by our competitors inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations table start annual report northern trust corporation table end a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system will be met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in addition there are risks that individuals either employees or contractors consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by for example exceeding trading or investment management limitations or committing fraud failure of any of our thirdparty vendors or their vendors to perform can result in losses thirdparty vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services and network access our use of thirdparty vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors or their vendors may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations including with respect to indemnification and information security and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services have in the past and could in the future have a negative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these thirdparty vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves has in the past and could in the future create significant delay and expense we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely in conducting our us and nonus business we are subject to risks of loss and adverse economic impacts from various unfavorable political economic legal public health or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls unfavorable tax rate changes tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets our nonus operations accounted for of our revenue in our nonus businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various nonus regulators including governments securities exchanges central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies moreover the regulatory and supervisory standards and expectations in one jurisdiction may not conform with standards or expectations in other jurisdictions even within a particular jurisdiction the standards and expectations of multiple supervisory agencies exercising authority over our affairs may not be harmonized fully accordingly it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally the failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could affect our business and results of operations adversely we actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint this optimization may occur by establishing operations in lowercost locations or by outsourcing to thirdparty vendors in various jurisdictions these efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality control or effective management within these operations in addition we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic political public health and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery in addition we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments money laundering and laws that prohibit us from doing business with certain individuals groups and countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the usa patriot act the uk bribery act and economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the us office of foreign assets control and similar agencies worldwide while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring the geographic diversity of our operations employees clients and customers as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules regulations laws or programs and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely table start annual report northern trust corporation table end failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results through various parts of our business strategy we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets in recent years increased expenses have affectedand a failure to control our costs and expenses in the future whether as a result of inflation or otherwise could affectour earnings negatively pandemics natural disasters global climate change acts of terrorism geopolitical tensions and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations pandemics natural disasters global climate change acts of terrorism geopolitical tensions global conflicts including the continuing military conflicts involving ukraine and the russian federation and israel and hamas or other similar events as well as government actions or other restrictions in connection with such events have had in the past or may in the future have a negative impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity plans such events may still damage our facilities disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business including communications and technology result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees impose significant compliance costs with new financial and economic sanctions regimes and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers thirdparty vendors and counterparties for example in some jurisdictions such as the russian federation local market restrictions laws sanctions programs or government intervention inhibit our clients and our ability to access or transfer cash or securities held for clients through subcustodians and clearing agencies when such client deposit liabilities are on our consolidated balance sheet we maintain a corresponding amount of cash on deposit with the subcustodian or clearing agency which increases our credit exposure to that entity and can accumulate over time based upon distributions on or other activities related to our clients assets if the subcustodian or clearing agency were to become insolvent in circumstances not involving expropriation of assets or other sovereign risk events andor factors or events beyond our reasonable control that excuse performance under force majeure or other contractual provisions the risk of loss on such cash on deposit may potentially be incurred by us as of december we held cash that accumulates in relation to russian securities with our subcustodian andor clearing agencies for the benefit of certain clients in our asset servicing business which are subject to restrictions that inhibit our ability to access or transfer such deposits and which amount is expected to increase significantly over time as long as the sanctions and other relevant restrictions remain in effect our subcustodian is also a subsidiary of a large global financial institution with whom we have other credit exposures which may limit the financial relationship we may have with this counterparty and has in the past made and may in the future make compliance with specific us regulatory single counterparty credit limits more challenging the foregoing or similar events also could impact us negatively to the extent that they result in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the us or abroad or in financial market settlement functions in addition these or similar events may impact economic growth negatively which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict please see strategic risks in this risk factors section for further description of risks associated with climate change credit risks failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings we evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including undrawn credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments including forecasts of economic conditions through the life of these credit exposures challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet which result in losses andor increased provisions for credit losses and in turn would affect earnings negatively market volatility andor weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings credit risk levels and our earnings can be affected by market volatility andor weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from market volatility elevated interest rates andor weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers abilities to repay outstanding loans which could in turn impact our financial condition and results of operations negatively table start annual report northern trust corporation table end the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions including banks brokerdealers collective investment funds and insurance companies as a result of these interconnections we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions this counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss instability in the financial markets or in certain countries where these counterparties are domiciled has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy during such periods of instability we are exposed to increased counterparty risks both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict in addition the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain further the consolidation of financial services firms and the failures of other financial institutions has in the past increased and may in the future increase the concentration of our counterparty risk these risks are heightened by the fact that our operating model relies on the use of unaffiliated subcustodians to a greater degree than certain of our competitors that have banking operations in more jurisdictions than we do we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients counterparty credit risk if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us we could incur financial losses that have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations liquidity risks if we do not manage our liquidity effectively our business could suffer liquidity is essential for the operation of our business market conditions unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could have a negative effect on our level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner if our access to stable and lowcost sources of funding such as customer deposits is reduced we may need to use alternative funding which could be more expensive or of limited availability further evolution in the regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively additional regulations may impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions including the corporation and the bank given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation in addition a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which by their nature require substantial liquidity our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow we also manage investment products that while not obligations of ours may be exposed to liquidity risks these products such as money market and other shortterm investments provide clients a right to the return of cash or assets on limited notice if clients demand a return of their cash or assets particularly on limited notice and these investment products do not have the liquidity to support those demands we could be forced to sell investment securities held by these investment products at unfavorable prices potentially damaging our reputation with the investment community for more information on regulations and other regulatory changes relating to liquidity see supervision and regulationliquidity standards in item business any substantial unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could affect our business adversely if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and the corporations other subsidiaries the corporation relies in large part on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporations other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances for more information on dividend restrictions see supervision and regulationpayment of dividends in item business we may need to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms we may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes however our ability to access the capital markets if needed will depend on a number of factors including the state of the financial markets rising interest rates disruptions in financial markets negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us for example in the event of future turmoil in the banking table start annual report northern trust corporation table end industry or other idiosyncratic events there is no guarantee that the us government will invoke the systemic risk exception create additional liquidity programs or take any other action to stabilize the banking industry or provide liquidity any diminished ability to access shortterm funding or capital markets to raise additional capital if needed could subject us to liability restrict our ability to grow require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan capital plan and strategic goals adversely any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity adversely rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on the agencies evaluation of a number of factors including our financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratingagencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity adversely a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being competitive in certain products additionally our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers all of which may have other adverse effects on our business the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation and in some instances failure of financial institutions including major global financial institutions could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients on our or our clients behalf will be compromised materially if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly regulatory and legal risks failure to comply with regulations andor supervisory expectations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated generally by domestic and foreign governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions these regulations cover a variety of matters including prohibited activities required capital levels resolution planning human trafficking and modern slavery and data privacy and security some of these requirements are directed specifically at protecting depositors of the bank the us dif and the banking system as a whole not our stockholders or other security holders regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies whether formal or based upon supervisory expectations on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely similarly changes in laws or failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively we are subject to extensive and evolving government regulation and supervision that impacts our operations changes by the us and other governments to laws regulations and policies applicable to the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make regulatory compliance more difficult and costly we operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to a comprehensive statutory and regulatory regime affecting all aspects of our business and operations including oversight by governmental agencies both inside and outside the us various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened scrutiny of financial institutions through many regulatory initiatives these initiatives have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a compliance violation even if the failure to comply was inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements we cannot provide assurance that these programs and policies are or will be adequate to identify and manage internal and external compliance risks for example our business may be adversely impacted by actual or alleged misconduct by an employee or other negative outcomes caused by human error changes to statutes regulations or regulatory and supervisory policies or their interpretation or implementation and the continued heightening of regulatory and supervisory requirements could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways table start annual report northern trust corporation table end additionally governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and these likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies any such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation affect our ability to compete successfully and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the full scope and impact of possible legislative or regulatory changes and the extent of regulatory activity is uncertain and difficult to predict for example we are unable to predict what if any changes to financial services laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry may be enacted by the us congress and what the impact of any such changes will be upon our business financial condition and results of operations the evolving regulatory and supervisory environment and uncertainty about the timing and scope of future laws regulations and policies may contribute to decisions we may make to suspend reduce or withdraw from existing businesses activities or initiatives which may result in potential lost revenue or significant restructuring or related costs or exposures we also face the risk of becoming subject to new or more stringent requirements in connection with the introduction of new regulations or modification of existing regulations which could require us to hold more capital or liquidity or have other adverse effects on our businesses or profitability for example proposed changes to applicable capital and liquidity requirements such as the basel iii endgame proposal and the longterm debt proposal could result in increased expenses or cost of funding which could negatively affect our financial results or our ability to pay dividends and engage in share repurchases for more information concerning our legal and regulatory obligations with respect to basel iii and longterm debt requirements see supervision and regulation in item business in addition regulatory responses in connection with severe market downturns or unforeseen stress events may alter or disrupt our planned future strategies and actions adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of other financial institutions the financial services industry as a whole and the general economic climate and the us treasury market could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments for example during the fdic took control and was appointed receiver of silicon valley bank signature bank and first republic bank the failure of other banks and financial institutions and the measures taken by governments and regulators in response to these events could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to complex and evolving laws regulations rules standards and contractual obligations regarding data privacy and security which could increase the cost of doing business compliance risks and potential liability we are subject to complex and evolving laws regulations rules standards and contractual obligations governing data privacy and security which may differ and potentially conflict in various jurisdictions and any failure to comply with these laws regulations rules standards and contractual obligations could expose us to liability andor reputational damage regulators globally are introducing the potential for greater monetary fines on institutions that suffer from breaches leading to the loss misappropriation or unauthorized access use or disclosure of personal confidential proprietary or sensitive information most us states the eu and other nonus jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes andor regulations concerning data privacy and security and notification of data breaches these and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of information could greatly increase compliance costs the size of potential fines related to the protection of such information and reporting obligations in the case of cyberattacks or other information security incidents compliance with these laws regulations rules and standards may require us to change and continuously update our policies procedures and technology controls for information security which could among other things make us more vulnerable to operational failures and to monetary penalties for breach of such laws regulations rules and standards in the us there are numerous federal state and local data privacy and security laws and regulations governing the collection sharing use retention disclosure security storage transfer and other processing of personal information at the federal level we are subject to among other laws and regulations the rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission and the grammleachbliley act moreover the us congress has recently considered and is currently considering various proposals for more comprehensive data privacy and security legislation to which we may be subject if enacted at the state level we are subject to laws and regulations such as the ccpa numerous other states also have enacted or are in the process of enacting or considering comprehensive statelevel data privacy and security laws and regulations that share similarities with the ccpa moreover laws in all us states require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach at the international level we are subject to the gdpr and uk gdpr and similar laws are in effect or being considered in other jurisdictions in which we operate across the globe while the gdpr and the uk gdpr remain substantially similar for the time being the uk government has announced that it would seek to chart its own path on data protection and reform its relevant laws including in ways that may differ from the gdpr to an extent legal developments in the eea and the uk also have created complexity and uncertainty regarding processing and transfers of table start annual report northern trust corporation table end personal data from the eea and the uk to the us and other socalled third countries outside the eea and the uk that have not been determined by the relevant data protection authorities to provide an adequate level of protection for privacy rights importantly significant monetary fines have been imposed since the introduction of such stringent privacy laws in the eu and the uk and regulatory expectations on governance and accountability in the protection of privacy and data continue to increase further while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy notices and policies that are accurate comprehensive and compliant with applicable laws regulations rules and industry standards we cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be considered sufficient to protect us from claims proceedings liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy and security considering the fastevolving regulatory expectations although we endeavor to comply with our privacy policies we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so the publication of our privacy policies and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about data privacy and security can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices any concerns about our data privacy and security practices even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies or applicable data privacy and security laws regulations rules standards or contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to or unauthorized loss destruction use modification acquisition disclosure release or transfer of personal information may result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices the expenditure of substantial costs time and other resources proceedings or actions against us legal liability governmental investigations enforcement actions claims fines judgments awards penalties sanctions and costly litigation including class actions any of the foregoing could harm our reputation distract our management and technical personnel increase our costs of doing business adversely affect the demand for our products and services and ultimately result in the imposition of liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilities our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we or third parties for whom they say we are responsible have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition regulators tax authorities and courts have increasingly sought to hold financial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients where such regulators and courts have determined that the financial institution should have detected that the client was engaged in wrongdoing even though the financial institution had no direct knowledge of the wrongdoing claims made or actions brought against us whether founded or unfounded may result in lawsuits injunctions settlements damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business even if we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders consequently affecting our earnings negatively we may be impacted adversely by supervisory andor regulatory enforcement matters in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to various governmental enforcement inquiries supervisory examinations investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be directed specifically at us in conjunction with both supervisory and enforcement matters we may face limits on our ability to conduct or expand our business be required to implement corrective actions that increase the costs of conducting business or become subject to civil or criminal penalties or other remedial sanctions any of which could result in reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse impact on us the complexity of the federal and state regulatory supervisory and enforcement regimes in the us coupled with the global scope of our operations and the increased aggressiveness of the tax and regulatory environment worldwide also means that a single event may give risk to a large number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings either by multiple agencies in the us or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities or tax authorities in different jurisdictions responding to inquiries investigations and proceedings regardless of the outcome of the matter is time consuming and expensive and can divert the attention of our senior management from our business the outcome of such proceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings which may last a number of years the number of regulatory and governmental investigations and proceedings as well as the amount of penalties and fines sought has remained elevated for many firms in the financial services industry the corporation and other financial table start annual report northern trust corporation table end institutions have become subject to increased scrutiny more intense supervision and regulation and a higher risk of enforcement action which we expect to continue any such heightened enforcement activity or new regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may fail to set aside adequate reserves for or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to pending and threatened claims with a negative effect on our earnings we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles gaap the process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case our earnings will be adversely affected if our reserves are not adequate the ultimate impact on us of regulatory divergence between the united kingdom and the european union remains uncertain while regulatory standards remain largely aligned following the uks withdrawal from the eu commonly referred to as brexit it is possible that future divergence may occur between the uk and eu therefore the final impact remains uncertain in december the uk and the eu agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that entered into force on may while the trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the uk and the eu it generally does not address the regulation of financial services instead in march the uk and the eu agreed upon a framework for voluntary regulatory cooperation and dialogue on financial services issues between the parties in a memorandum of understanding which was signed on june since the uks withdrawal from the eu on december the uk government has embarked on a program of significant regulatory reform in particular the recently enacted financial services and markets act contains provisions that will eventually repeal all eu rules and regulations relating to financial services that were incorporated into uk law following brexit the uk government and the uk financial services regulatory authorities has been consulting on a number of measures that will replace the current eubased rules and regulations with measures that reflect the particular needs of the uk market and policy objectives of the uks regulatory authorities consequently over time it is likely that the rules and regulations relating to financial services will diverge which may result in additional compliance costs for our uk and eu businesses if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could affect our earnings negatively managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is an important part of our business failure to comply with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws manage adequately the risks or manage appropriately the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities may subject us to liability or cause client dissatisfaction which may impact negatively our earnings and growth strategic risks if we are not able to attract retain and motivate personnel our business could be negatively affected our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain necessary personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs these laws and regulations may not apply in the same manner to all financial institutions and other companies which therefore may subject us to more restrictions than other institutions and companies with which we compete for talent and may also hinder our ability to compete for talent with other industries in addition our current or future approach to inoffice and remote work arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of our current or prospective employees may not be perceived as favorable as compared to the arrangements offered by competitors and may not be conducive to a collaborative working environment which could adversely affect our ability to attract retain and motivate employees the unexpected loss of services of necessary personnel both in businesses and corporate functions could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets operations and clients years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of necessary employees either individually or as a group could affect our clients perception of our abilities adversely a competitive labor market may also have the effect of heightening many of these risks table start annual report northern trust corporation table end if we do not develop and execute strategic plans successfully our growth may be impacted negatively our growth depends upon successful consistent development and execution of our business strategies a failure to develop and execute these strategies may impact growth negatively a failure to grow organically or to integrate successfully an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners delivering enhanced products and services as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems to the extent we enter into transactions to acquire complementary businesses andor technologies we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions which could result in increased costs lowered revenues ineffective deployment of capital regulatory concerns exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation these risks may be increased if the acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents which may include approvals of the federal reserve board and other domestic and nonus regulatory authorities these regulatory authorities have the ability to impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities further acquisitions we announce may not be completed or completed in the time frame anticipated if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures the same may be said for competitors based in nonus jurisdictions where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those applicable to the corporation and the bank as usdomiciled financial institutions these competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price also may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which could have and in some cases has had a negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitability damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue our ability to compete effectively to attract and retain clients and employees and to grow our business is dependent on maintaining our reputation damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects and can arise from various sources including among others the failure or perceived failure to meet or appropriately address client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations operational failures legal and regulatory requirements potential conflicts of interest data privacy and security social and sustainability concerns related to our business activities or any other of the risks discussed in this item additionally the actual or alleged actions of our affiliates vendors or other third parties with which we do business the actual or alleged actions or statements of our employees or adverse publicity could negatively impact our reputation and significantly harm our business prospects damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service could undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and accordingly affect our earnings negatively damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies regulators stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business and the performance of our common stock failure to maintain our reputation ultimately could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively or lead to a general loss of confidence in or impact market perception of financial institutions that could negatively affect us our reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding the corporation and the bank whether true or not that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media nonmainstream news services or other parts of the internet the proliferation of social media channels utilized by us and third parties as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others may increase the risk of negative publicity including through the rapid dissemination of inaccurate misleading or false information which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences furthermore esgrelated issues have been the subject of increased focus by regulators and stakeholders including outside the us and particularly in europe any inability to meet applicable requirements or expectations including those from conflicting us and nonus global expectations may adversely table start annual report northern trust corporation table end impact our reputation additionally various stakeholders have divergent views on esgrelated matters including in the countries in which we operate and invest as well as states and localities where we serve public sector clients in the case of proxy voting there is the inherent risk of misalignment between the proxy votes we cast on behalf of clients and all of our clients values and preferences this divergence increases the risk that any action or lack thereof by us on such matters will be perceived negatively by some stakeholders and could adversely impact our reputation and business we need to invest in innovation constantly and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation particularly in light of the current fintech environment in which the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes and financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies such as artificial intelligence machine learning blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies and developing potentially industrychanging new products services and industry standards our investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins our investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings is important to our success failure to keep pace with our competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities growth and earnings adversely there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts including an increased risk that new and emerging technologies may expose us to increased data privacy and security and other information technology threats we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met further our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require startup costs while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings may affect our businesses and earnings negatively the success of our innovation efforts depends in part on the successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings our success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions any failure to understand address or comply with those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation negatively we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully we could incur financial loss suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive in addition our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in legal or regulatory requirements our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets legal and regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings we may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted table start annual report northern trust corporation table end our operations businesses and clients could be materially adversely affected by the effects of climate change or concerns related thereto risks related to climate change may impact our business financial condition and results of operations adversely the physical risks of climate change include rising average global temperatures rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters such developments could disrupt our operations and resilience capabilities those of our clients or third parties on which we rely further the consequences of climate change could negatively impact our clients ability to pay outstanding loans reduce the value of collateral or result in insurance shortfalls climate change could also result in transition risk arising from changes in policy regulations technology business practices or market preferences toward a lowercarbon economy which could adversely impact us or our clients these impacts could result in increased operational or compliance costs higher energy expenses additional taxes and the devaluation of assets our reputation and business prospects may also be damaged if we do not or are perceived not to effectively prepare for the potential business and operational opportunities and risks associated with climate change including through the development and marketing of effective and competitive new products and services designed to address our clients climate riskrelated needs we also face regulatory and liability risk associated with greenwashing claims a failure to execute on our public climaterelated commitments or by association with individuals entities industries or products that may be inconsistent with our stated positions on climate change issues at the same time certain financial institutions have also been subject to significant scrutiny by regulatory agencies and government officials and other criticism and negative publicity as a result of their decisions to reduce their involvement in certain industries or projects perceived to be associated with climate change if we do not identify quantify and mitigate such risks successfully we may experience financial losses litigation reputational harm and losses of investor and stakeholder confidence even as regulators begin to mandate additional disclosure of climaterelated information by companies across sectors methodologies and data used to conduct more robust climaterelated risk analyses are still in development thirdparty exposures emissions climaterelated risks and other data are limited in availability and variable in quality modeling capabilities across the industry to analyze climaterelated risks and interconnections are improving but remain imperfect these legislative and regulatory uncertainties along with inconsistencies and conflicts of policy across jurisdictions and changes regarding climaterelated risk management and disclosures are likely to result in higher regulatory compliance credit reputational and other risks and costs other risks the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are inherently limited may not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we face we use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories as well as for other business purposes while we assess and improve these systems and models on an ongoing basis there can be no assurance that they along with other related controls will effectively mitigate risk under all circumstances or that they will adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us as with any systems and models there are inherent limitations because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes further these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of the risks we face or they may not be effective against all types of risk including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predicators of future outcomes and their ability to appropriately predict future outcomes may degrade over time due to limited historical patterns extreme or unanticipated market movements or customer behavior
