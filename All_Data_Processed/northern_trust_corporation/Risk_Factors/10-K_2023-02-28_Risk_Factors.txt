item risk factors in the normal course of our business activities we are exposed to a variety of risks the following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to northern trust although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business financial condition or results of operations you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as reducing the price of our common stock and other securities reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients counterparties andor applicable regulators have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the cost at which we are able to do so additional risks beyond those discussed below elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could affect us adversely further we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face and you should not interpret discussion of any risk to imply that such risk has not already materialized these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10k forwardlooking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under forwardlooking statements included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations table start annual report northern trust corporation table end summary our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by various risk types and considerations including market risks operational risks credit risks liquidity risks regulatory and legal risks strategic risks and other risks including as a result of the following market risks we are dependent on feebased business for a majority of our revenues which may be affected adversely by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively changes in the monetary trade and other policies of various regulatory authorities central banks governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty in the global economy including the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively operational risks many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively failures of or disruptions to our technological systems or breaches of our security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattacks may result in losses errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways our dependence on technology and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure exposes us to risks that also can result in losses a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations failure of any of our thirdparty vendors or their vendors to perform can result in losses we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively pandemics natural disasters global climate change acts of terrorism geopolitical tensions and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations credit risks failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings market volatility andor weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss the transition away from libor or changes in the method pursuant to which other interest rate benchmarks are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations liquidity risks if we do not manage our liquidity effectively our business could suffer if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations we may need to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity adversely table start annual report northern trust corporation table end regulatory and legal risks failure to comply with regulations andor supervisory expectations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings changes by the us and other governments to laws regulations and policies applicable to the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make regulatory compliance more difficult and costly we may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilities we may be impacted adversely by supervisory andor regulatory enforcement matters we may fail to set aside adequate reserves for or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to pending and threatened claims with a negative effect on our earnings the ultimate impact on us of the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union remains uncertain if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could affect our earnings negatively strategic risks if we are not able to attract retain and motivate personnel our business could be negatively affected our operations businesses and clients could be materially adversely affected by the effects of climate change or concerns related thereto if we do not develop and execute strategic plans successfully our growth may be impacted negatively we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue we need to invest in innovation constantly and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings may affect our businesses and earnings negatively our success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings other risks the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are inherently limited may not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we face changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may affect our earnings negatively changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements our ability to return capital to stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by us banking laws and regulations applicable provisions of delaware law or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt table start annual report northern trust corporation table end market risks we are dependent on feebased business for a majority of our revenues which may be affected adversely by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences our principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management custody or administration the volume of transactions processed securities lending volume and spreads fees for other services rendered and in certain businesses fees calculated as a percentage of our clients earnings all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences for example downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debtrelated investments resulting from market disruption illiquidity or other factors historically have reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impacted our earnings negatively further although we do not hold invest in or custody cryptocurrency assets the markets in which they trade are highly volatile and volatility in these markets may impact the markets for other assets that we hold invest in or custody which could also impact our fees or financial condition market volatility andor weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide our earnings also may be affected by poor investment returns or changes in investment preferences driven by factors beyond market volatility or weak economic conditions poor absolute or relative investment performance in funds or client accounts that we manage or in investment products that we design or provide may result in declines in the market values of portfolios that we manage andor administer and may affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients for example in outflows we experienced in certain of our products as a result of the impact of weaker markets and relative investment performance adversely impacted our overall fees derived from assets that we manage broader changes in investment preferences that lead to less investment in mutual funds or other collective funds such as the shift in investor preference to lower fee products could also impact our earnings negatively changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings interest rate changes could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities in response to rising inflation the federal reserve board has increased interest rates from historically low levels while a rising interest rate environment generally has a positive effect on our net interest margin in some circumstances a rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively for example the recent rapid increases in interest rates has adversely impacted the value of certain of our investment securities with resultant impacts on our capital liquidity and earnings additionally recent higher interest rates have caused and may in the future cause market volatility and downturns in equity markets resulting in a decrease in the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impact our earnings negatively our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments resulting in increased credit costs provisions for loan and lease losses and chargeoffs reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity resulting in lower performance yields and fees or higher funding costs conversely lowinterestrate environments generally result in a compressed net interest margin and also have a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products for example in the past we waived certain fees associated with money market funds due to the low level of shortterm interest rates low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earnings although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective which could impact earnings negatively please see market risk in the risk management section included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face changes in the monetary trade and other policies of various regulatory authorities central banks governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively the monetary trade and other policies of us and international governments agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on economic conditions and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing and play a role in contributing to or moderating levels of inflation all of which meaningfully impact our earnings recent actions of the federal reserve board and other regulatory authorities have reduced the value of financial instruments we hold and may continue to do so in the future further their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available which may table start annual report northern trust corporation table end increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us changes in monetary trade and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business financial condition or results of operations macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty in the global economy including the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings risks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world foreign market and economic disruptions have affected and may in the future affect consumer confidence levels and spending international trade policy personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt and home prices additionally financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict including the continuing military conflict involving ukraine and the russian federation terrorism political or civil unrest sovereign debt downgrades or debt crises including any uncertainty over the us government debt ceiling public health epidemics or pandemics the exit or potential exit of one or more countries from the eu or other geopolitical events the cumulative effect of uncertain business conditions or e conomic challenges faced in various foreign markets including fiscal or monetary concerns rising inflation and interest rates economic downturns and the possibility of a recession in some jurisdictions other economic factors including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes to tax laws or the application or enforcement practices of such laws or volatility or lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business financial condition and results of operations declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio which is generally determined based upon market values available from thirdparty sources have fluctuated and may continue in the future to fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital liquidity and to the extent we realize losses earnings although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks including hedgingrelated strategies those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks accordingly market risks have from time to time negatively affected the value of securities held in our investment portfolio and in the future we could suffer additional adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings we provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods we also are exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investments in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks including hedgingrelated strategies any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively please see market risk in the risk management section included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively in past periods reductions in the volatility of currencytrading markets the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively in certain of our businesses such as securities lending our fee is calculated as a percentage of our clients earnings such that market and other factors that reduce our clients earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues table start annual report northern trust corporation table end operational risks many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk our risk management program may not be effective in all cases factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size scale and scope some or all of which may be exacerbated by the increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements in recent years include failures of technological systems or breaches of security measures including but not limited to those resulting from computer viruses or cyberattacks human errors or omissions including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems breakdowns in processes overreliance on manual processes which are less scalable and inherently more prone to error than automated processes breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the systems and facilities that support our operations unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades defects in product design or delivery difficulty in accurately pricing assets which can be aggravated by market volatility and illiquidity and lack of reliable pricing from thirdparty vendors negative developments in relationships with key counterparties thirdparty vendors employees or associates in our daytoday operations and external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control such as pandemics geopolitical events political or social unrest natural disasters or acts of terrorism while we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively we also may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businessesparticularly as our geographic footprint product pipeline and client needs and expectations evolveand consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion if our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully such factors may have a negative impact on our business including operational resilience financial condition or results of operations in addition an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand the inherent risk in our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions we continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate for our role as a major financial institution nonetheless if we fail to provide the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk our business could be impacted adversely please see other risks in this risk factors section for further description of risks associated with the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks failures of or disruptions to our technological systems or breaches of our security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattacks may result in losses our business is dependent on our and third parties information technology systems despite our implementation of a variety of security measures our computer systems networks and data could be subject to cyberattacks and unauthorized access use alteration or destruction such as from physical and electronic breakins or unauthorized tampering malware and computer virus attacks or system failures and disruptions any failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations and could subject us to liability claims harm our reputation interrupt our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations our systems involve the processing storage and transmission of clients and our proprietary and confidential information and security breaches including cyberattacks could expose us to a risk of theft loss or other misappropriation of this information our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error failure of our controls with respect to access to our systems malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients proprietary and confidential information resulting in the theft loss destruction gathering monitoring dissemination or other misappropriation of this information additionally our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities table start annual report northern trust corporation table end additionally we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing cybersecurity data privacy and data protection which may differ and potentially conflict in various jurisdictions regulators globally are introducing the potential for greater monetary fines on institutions that suffer from breaches leading to the misappropriation of such information most states the eu and other nonus jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes andor regulations concerning data privacy and security and notification of data breaches these and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of information could greatly increase compliance costs and the size of potential fines related to the protection of such information information security and data privacy risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the evolving proliferation of new technologies the use of internetbased solutions mobile devices and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and rapidly evolving techniques of hackers terrorists organized crime and other external parties including foreign state actors if we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure effective information security and data privacy relative to the type size and complexity of our operations we could become more vulnerable to cyberattack and consequently subject to significant regulatory penalties and reputational damage also like many large enterprises in response to the covid19 pandemic in recent years a significant portion of our workforce has shifted to a hybrid work environment that includes a combination of inoffice and remote work the increase in remote work and remote access to our systems initially driven by the covid19 pandemic also introduces potential vulnerabilities to cyber threats the third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business while we conduct security assessments on thirdparty vendors we cannot be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach in addition our clients often use personal devices such as computers smart phones and tablets which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft as well as third parties with whom they share information used for authentication to access our systems and manage their accounts which may heighten the risk of system failures interruptions or security breaches moreover the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyberattacks could disrupt our operations or the operations of our or their service providers and result in misappropriation corruption or loss of personal confidential or proprietary information or the inability to conduct ordinary business operations in addition there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available in recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private information and reputational harm we and our clients have been and expect to continue to be subject to a wide variety of cyberattacks and threats including computer viruses ransomware and other malicious code distributed denial of service attacks and phishing and vishing attacks and it is possible that we could suffer material losses resulting from a breach because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques to implement adequate preventative measures or to address them until they are discovered in addition successful cyberattacks may persist for an extended period of time before being detected because any investigation of an information security incident would be inherently unpredictable the extent of a particular information security incident and the path of investigating the incident may not be immediately clear it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while such an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated and communication to the public regulators clients and other stakeholders may be inaccurate any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of an information security incident we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings related to security incidents including regulatory investigations and actions further the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients in conjunction with security incidents each of which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a breach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our business an event that results in the loss of information also may require us to reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services which could be costly and have a negative impact on our business and reputation although we maintain insurance coverage in the event of information theft damage or destruction from cyber breach incidents there can be no assurance table start annual report northern trust corporation table end that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate to cover such losses further even if not directed at us attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system or on our counterparties could affect directly or indirectly aspects of our business errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways in our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses further remote working and other modified business practices initiated in response to the covid19 pandemic combined with the increasing sophistication and frequency of potential cyber incidents have heightened our operational and execution risk given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected our dependence on technology and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure exposes us to risks that also can result in losses our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure both internal and external to record and process among other things a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data in many currencies on a daily basis across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations combined with the increasing sophistication and frequency of potential cyber incidents we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure upgrading replacing and modernizing these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation integration and security risks that could cause financial reputational and operational harm in some cases the covid19 pandemic has accelerated the transition from traditional to digital financial services and heightened customer expectations in this area and this transition may require us to invest greater resources in technological advancements failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations the failure to respond properly to and invest in changes and advancements in technology andor to compete for and retain employees with the necessary technical skills and expertise could limit our ability to attract and retain clients prevent us from offering products and services comparable to those offered by our competitors inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system will be met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in addition there are risks that individuals either employees or contractors consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by for example exceeding trading or investment management limitations or committing fraud failure of any of our thirdparty vendors or their vendors to perform can result in losses thirdparty vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services and network access our use of thirdparty vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors or their vendors may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations including with respect to indemnification and information security and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could have a negative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these thirdparty vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves could create significant delay and expense table start annual report northern trust corporation table end we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely in conducting our us and nonus business we are subject to risks of loss from various unfavorable political economic legal public health or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls unfavorable tax rates and tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets our nonus operations accounted for of our revenue in our nonus businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various nonus regulators including governments securities exchanges central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies moreover the regulatory and supervisory standards and expectations in one jurisdiction may not conform with standards or expectations in other jurisdictions even within a particular jurisdiction the standards and expectations of multiple supervisory agencies exercising authority over our affairs may not be harmonized fully accordingly it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally the failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could affect our business and results of operations adversely we actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint this optimization may occur by establishing operations in lowercost locations or by outsourcing to thirdparty vendors in various jurisdictions these efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality control or effective management within these operations in addition we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic political public health and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery in addition we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments money laundering and laws relating to doing business with certain individuals groups and countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the usa patriot act the uk bribery act and economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the us office of foreign assets control and similar agencies worldwide while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring the geographic diversity of our operations employees clients and customers as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules regulations laws or programs and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results through various parts of our business strategy we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets recently increased expenses have affected and a failure to control our costs and expenses in the future as a result of an overall inflationary environment or otherwise could affect our earnings negatively pandemics natural disasters global climate change acts of terrorism geopolitical tensions and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations pandemics natural disasters global climate change acts of terrorism geopolitical tensions global conflicts including the continuing military conflict involving ukraine and the russian federation or other similar events have had in the past or may in the future have a negative impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity plans such events may still damage our facilities disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business including communications and technology result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees impose significant compliance costs with new financial and economic sanctions regimes and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers thirdparty vendors and counterparties for example in some jurisdictions such as the russian federation local market restrictions laws sanctions programs or government intervention inhibit our clients and our ability to access or transfer cash or securities held for clients through subcustodians and clearing agencies when such client deposit liabilities are on our consolidated balance sheet we maintain a corresponding amount of cash on deposit with the subcustodian or clearing agency which increases our credit exposure to that entity and can accumulate over time based upon distributions on or other activities related to our clients assets if the subcustodian or clearing agency were to become insolvent in circumstances not involving expropriation of assets or other sovereign risk events andor factors or events beyond our reasonable control that excuse performance under force majeure or other contractual provisions the risk of loss on such table start annual report northern trust corporation table end cash on deposit may potentially be incurred by us as of december we held cash that accumulates in relation to russian securities with our subcustodian andor clearing agencies for the benefit of certain clients in our asset servicing business which are subject to restrictions which inhibit our ability to access or transfer such deposits and which amount is expected to increase significantly over time as long as the sanctions and other relevant restrictions remain in effect the foregoing or similar events also could impact us negatively to the extent that they result in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions in addition these or similar events may impact economic growth negatively which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict please see strategic risks in this risk factors section for further description of risks associated with climate change credit risks failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings we evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including undrawn credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet which result in losses andor increased provisions for credit losses and in turn would affect earnings negatively market volatility andor weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings credit risk levels and our earnings can be affected by market volatility andor weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from market volatility andor weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers abilities to repay outstanding loans which could in turn impact our financial condition and results of operations negatively the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions including banks brokerdealers collective investment funds and insurance companies as a result of these interconnections we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions this counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss instability in the financial markets has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy during such periods of instability we are exposed to increased counterparty risks both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict in addition the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain further the consolidation of financial services firms and the failures of other financial institutions has in the past increased and may in the future increase the concentration of our counterparty risk these risks are heightened by the fact that our operating model relies on the use of unaffiliated subcustodians to a greater degree than certain of our competitors that have banking operations in more jurisdictions than we do we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients counterparty credit risk if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us we could incur financial losses that have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the transition away from libor or changes in the method pursuant to which other interest rate benchmarks are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations global regulators have taken steps to discontinue the publication and use of interbank offered rates each an ibor encourage the development and use of alternative reference rates and examine the progress regulated entities such as northern trust are making to transition from ibors to alternative reference rates publication of 1week and 2month usd libor ceased as of december and publication of the remaining usd libor tenors are expected to continue until june usd libor historically has been a widely used interest rate benchmark and the reference rate for our floatingrate funding certain of the products that we own various lending and securities transactions in which we are involved and certain of the derivatives that we use to manage our or our clients risk some regulators have prohibited the use of any libor benchmarks in new contracts and have required that regulated entities transition existing contracts to another benchmark prior to june although the setting of such libor benchmarks may continue to be available such prohibitions and requirements or any other change in the availability or table start annual report northern trust corporation table end calculation of libor or other interest rate benchmarks may affect adversely the cost or availability of floatingrate funding the yield on loans or securities held by us the amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into the value of loans securities or derivative instruments held by us or our clients which in the case of assets held by our clients could also negatively impact the amount of fees we earn in relation to such assets the trading market for securities based on libor or other benchmarks the terms of new loans being made using different or modified reference rates or our ability to use derivative instruments to manage risk effectively various regulators industry bodies and other market participants in the united states and other countries have developed and continue to refine alternative rate benchmarks for various financial products while there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted by market participants as alternatives to libor for new contracts after libor publication ceases a group of large banks and the alternative reference rate committee arrc identified and the federal reserve bank of new york in may started to publish the secured overnight finance rate sofr as its preferred alternative to libor the adjustable interest rate libor act the libor act signed into law in march provides for the use of interest rates based on sofr in certain contracts currently based on libor and a safe harbor from liability for utilizing sofrbased interest rates as a replacement for libor in december the federal reserve board adopted a final rule implementing the libor act by identifying benchmark rates based on sofr that will replace libor in certain financial contracts after june sofr has different characteristics than libor and may demonstrate less predictable behavior over time and across different monetary market and economic environments therefore it is unclear the extent to which sofr will become a widely accepted replacement for libor we are working to facilitate an orderly transition from usd libor to alternative interest rate benchmarks for us and our clients and in accordance with guidance from us regulators including the federal reserve board we stopped offering usd libor in new contracts and began offering sofr as an alternative to usd libor in while some existing usd libor loans will mature or be prepaid a portion of our loans will remain and potentially require us to name a replacement index before june the date usd libor ceases we are currently in the process of evaluating all such transitions the language in our usd liborbased contracts and financial instruments has developed over time and may have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected if a trigger is satisfied contracts and financial instruments may give a party discretion to determine the substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates to be selected additionally the transition to alternative rates may change our market risk profile requiring changes to risk and pricing models while some instruments may contemplate a scenario where libor is no longer available by providing an alternative rate setting methodology not all instruments may have such provisions and there is significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative methodologies there continues to be uncertainty regarding the effect that these developments any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other interest rate benchmarks or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on libor or other interest rate benchmarks further the transition away from the use of libor and the adoption of alternative interest rate benchmarks and uncertainty related to any such transition or adoption has caused and may in the future cause us to recognize additional costs it may also cause us to experience operational disruptions or result in client disputes or litigation which may negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations liquidity risks if we do not manage our liquidity effectively our business could suffer liquidity is essential for the operation of our business market conditions unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could have a negative effect on our level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner if our access to stable and lowcost sources of funding such as customer deposits is reduced we may need to use alternative funding which could be more expensive or of limited availability further evolution in the regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively additional regulations may impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions including the corporation and the bank given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation in addition a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which by their nature require substantial liquidity our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow for more information on regulations and other regulatory changes relating to liquidity see supervision and regulationliquidity standards in item business any substantial unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could affect our business adversely table start annual report northern trust corporation table end if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and the corporations other subsidiaries the corporation relies in large part on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporations other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances for more information on

available on unfavorable terms we may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes however our ability to access the capital markets if needed will depend on a number of factors including the state of the financial markets rising interest rates disruptions in financial markets negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us any diminished ability to raise additional capital if needed could subject us to liability restrict our ability to grow require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan capital plan and strategic goals adversely any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity adversely rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratingagencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity adversely a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being competitive in certain products additionally our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers all of which may have other adverse effects on our business the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation and in some instances failure of financial institutions including major global financial institutions could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients on our or our clients behalf will be compromised materially if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly regulatory and legal risks failure to comply with regulations andor supervisory expectations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated generally by domestic and foreign governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions these regulations cover a variety of matters including prohibited activities required capital levels resolution planning human trafficking and modern slavery and privacy and data protection some of these requirements are directed specifically at protecting depositors of the bank the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not our stockholders or other security holders regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies whether formal or based upon supervisory expectations on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely similarly changes in laws or failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively table start annual report northern trust corporation table end changes by the us and other governments to laws regulations and policies applicable to the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make regulatory compliance more difficult and costly various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny of financial institutions through many regulatory initiatives these initiatives have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a compliance violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees governments and regulatory agencies may take further actions to change significantly the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods we cannot currently predict the impact if any of these changes to our business additionally governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and these likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies any such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation affect our ability to compete successfully and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the full scope and impact of possible legislative or regulatory changes and the extent of regulatory activity is uncertain and difficult to predict for example we are unable to predict what if any changes to financial services laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry may be enacted by the us congress and what the impact of any such changes will be upon our business financial condition and results of operations moreover the current us presidential administration has made and is expected to make further changes in the leadership and senior staffs of the federal banking agencies which are likely to impact the rulemaking supervision examination and enforcement priorities and policies of such agencies the potential impacts of which if any we cannot predict with certainty at this time we may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilities our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition regulators tax authorities and courts have increasingly sought to hold financial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients where such regulators and courts have determined that the financial institution should have detected that the client was engaged in wrongdoing even though the financial institution had no direct knowledge of the wrongdoing claims made or actions brought against us whether founded or unfounded may result in injunctions settlements damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business even if we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders consequently affecting our earnings negatively we may be impacted adversely by supervisory andor regulatory enforcement matters in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to various governmental enforcement inquiries supervisory examinations investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be directed specifically at us in conjunction with both supervisory and enforcement matters we may face limits on our ability to conduct or expand our business be required to implement corrective actions that increase the costs of conducting business or become subject to civil or criminal penalties or other remedial sanctions any of which could result in reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse impact on us for example the current us presidential administration or future administrations could support an enhanced regulatory enforcement agenda or propose new regulations that impose greater costs on financial services companies any such heightened enforcement activity or new regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may fail to set aside adequate reserves for or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to pending and threatened claims with a negative effect on our earnings we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles gaap the process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case our earnings will be adversely affected if our reserves are not adequate table start annual report northern trust corporation table end the ultimate impact on us of the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union remains uncertain while the uks withdrawal from the eu commonly referred to as brexit officially became effective on december certain items remain to be negotiated therefore the final impact remains uncertain in december the uk and the eu agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that entered into force on may while the trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the uk and the eu it generally does not address the regulation of financial services instead in march the uk and the eu agreed upon a framework for voluntary regulatory cooperation and dialogue on financial services issues between the parties in a memorandum of understanding which is expected to be signed after certain formal steps are completed although this has not yet occurred consequently the ultimate impact of brexit on the corporation and the bank remains uncertain and will depend on the terms of the postbrexit relationships that remain to be negotiated between the uk and other eu nations particularly in the area of financial services we have incurred and may in the future continue to incur costs associated with brexit planning measures while unforeseen political regulatory or other developments related to brexit or operational issues associated with any organizational restructuring related thereto may result in additional costs and disruption to our uk and eu businesses a failure to agree to a sustainable and practical financial services regulatory relationship between the uk and the eu whether on the basis of equivalence mutual recognition or otherwise could harm our business financial condition and results of operations any further exits from the eu or the possibility of such exits would likely cause additional market disruption globally and introduce new legal and regulatory uncertainties if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could affect our earnings negatively managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is an important part of our business failure to comply with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws manage adequately the risks or manage appropriately the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities may subject us to liability or cause client dissatisfaction which may impact negatively our earnings and growth strategic risks if we are not able to attract retain and motivate personnel our business could be negatively affected our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain necessary personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs these regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent in addition our current or future approach to inoffice and remote work arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of our current or prospective employees may not be perceived as favorable as compared to the arrangements offered by competitors and may not be conducive to a collaborative working environment which could adversely affect our ability to attract retain and motivate employees the unexpected loss of services of necessary personnel both in businesses and corporate functions could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets operations and clients years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of necessary employees either individually or as a group could affect our clients perception of our abilities adversely the current competitive labor market may also have the effect of heightening many of these risks table start annual report northern trust corporation table end our operations businesses and clients could be materially adversely affected by the effects of climate change or concerns related thereto risks related to climate change may impact our business financial condition and results of operations adversely the physical risks of climate change include rising average global temperatures rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such developments could disrupt our operations and resilience capabilities those of our clients or third parties on which we rely further the consequences of climate change could negatively impact our clients ability to pay outstanding loans reduce the value of collateral or result in insurance shortfalls climate change could also result in transition risk arising from changes in regulations or market preferences toward a lowcarbon economy changes in consumer andor investor preferences new legislation and expanded regulatory requirements related to climate risk could adversely impact us or our clients our reputation and business prospects may also be damaged if we do not or are perceived not to effectively prepare for the potential business and operational opportunities and risks associated with climate change including through the development and marketing of effective and competitive new products and services designed to address our clients climate riskrelated needs these risks include negative market perception diminished sales effectiveness and regulatory and litigation consequences associated with greenwashing claims or a failure to execute on our public climaterelated commitments or driven by association with individuals entities industries or products that may be inconsistent with our stated positions on climate change issues at the same time certain financial institutions have also been subject to significant scrutiny by regulatory agencies and government officials and other criticism and negative publicity as a result of their decisions to reduce their involvement in certain industries or projects perceived to be associated with climate change if we do not identify quantify and mitigate such risks successfully we may experience financial losses litigation reputational harm and losses of investor and stakeholder confidence even as regulators begin to mandate additional disclosure of climaterelated information by companies across sectors there may continue to be a lack of information for more robust climaterelated risk analyses thirdparty exposures to climaterelated risks and other data generally are limited in availability and variable in quality modeling capabilities across the industry to analyze climaterelated risks and interconnections are improving but remain incomplete legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climaterelated risk management and disclosures are likely to result in higher regulatory compliance credit reputational and other risks and costs and may subject us to evolving and potentially conflicting requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we operate if we do not develop and execute strategic plans successfully our growth may be impacted negatively our growth depends upon successful consistent development and execution of our business strategies a failure to develop and execute these strategies may impact growth negatively a failure to grow organically or to integrate successfully an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners delivering enhanced products and services as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems to the extent we enter into transactions to acquire complementary businesses andor technologies we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions which could result in increased costs lowered revenues ineffective deployment of capital regulatory concerns exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation these risks may be increased if the acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents which may include approvals of the federal reserve board and other domestic and nonus regulatory authorities these regulatory authorities have the ability to impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities further acquisitions we announce may not be completed or completed in the time frame anticipated if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied table start annual report northern trust corporation table end we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures the same may be said for competitors based in nonus jurisdictions where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those applicable to the corporation and the bank as usdomiciled financial institutions these competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price also may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which could have and in some cases has had a negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitability damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue the failure or perceived failure to meet or appropriately address client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations operational failures legal and regulatory requirements potential conflicts of interest cybersecurity and privacy social and sustainability concerns related to our business activities or any other of the risks discussed in this item could materially and adversely affect our reputation as well as our ability to attract and retain clients or employees additionally the actual or alleged actions of our affiliates vendors or other third parties with which we do business the actual or alleged actions or statements of our employees or adverse publicity could negatively impact our reputation and significantly harm our business prospects damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service could undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and accordingly affect our earnings negatively damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies regulators stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business and the performance of our common stock failure to maintain our reputation ultimately could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively or lead to a general loss of confidence in or impact market perception of financial institutions that could negatively affect us further whereas negative public opinion once was driven primarily by adverse news coverage in traditional media the proliferation of social media channels utilized by us and third parties as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others may increase the risk of negative publicity including through the rapid dissemination of inaccurate misleading or false information which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences we need to invest in innovation constantly and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation particularly in light of the current fintech environment in which the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes and financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies such as artificial intelligence machine learning blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies and developing potentially industrychanging new products services and industry standards our investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins our investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important to our success failure to keep pace with our competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities growth and earnings adversely there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts including an increased risk that new and emerging technologies may expose us to increased cybersecurity and other information technology threats we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met further our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require startup costs while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all table start annual report northern trust corporation table end failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings may affect our businesses and earnings negatively the success of our innovation efforts depends in part on the successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings our success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions any failure to understand address or comply with those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation negatively we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully we could incur financial loss suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive in addition our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in legal or regulatory requirements our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets legal and regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings we may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted other risks the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are inherently limited may not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we face we use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories as well as for other business purposes while we assess and improve these systems and models on an ongoing basis there can be no assurance that they along with other related controls will effectively mitigate risk under all circumstances or that they will adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us as with any systems and models there are inherent limitations because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes further these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of the risks we face or they may not be effective against all types of risk including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant consequently the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations errors in the underlying model or model assumptions or inadequate model assumptions could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences including material loss or noncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectations table start annual report northern trust corporation table end changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may affect our earnings negatively both us and nonus governments and tax authorities including states and municipalities from time to time issue new or modify existing tax laws and regulations these authorities may also issue new or modify existing interpretations of those laws and regulations these new laws regulations or interpretations and our actions taken in response to or reliance upon such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that affects our earnings negatively in the course of our business we are sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities including states and municipalities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income deductions tax credits or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which may require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise affect earnings negatively changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements new accounting standards changes to existing accounting standards or changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board the sec or bank regulatory agencies or otherwise reflected in gaap potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations these changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods our ability to return capital to stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by us banking laws and regulations applicable provisions of delaware law or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends and other distributions of capital as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments under delaware law although we have declared cash dividends on shares of our common stock historically we are not required to do so in addition to the approval of our board of directors our ability to take certain actions including our ability to pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions is dependent upon among other things their payment being made in accordance with the capital plan rules and capital adequacy standards of the federal reserve board a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result our ability to pay dividends on the corporations common stock will depend in large part on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporations other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances if the bank is unable to pay dividends to the corporation in the future our ability to pay dividends on the corporations common stock would be affected adversely our ability to declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to our preferred stock as to the payment of dividends andor the distribution of any assets on any liquidation dissolution or windingup of the corporation also generally will be prohibited in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends on our series d noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series d preferred stock and series e noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series e preferred stock further in the future if we default on certain of our outstanding debt we will be prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock until such payments have been brought current any reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or even our failure to maintain the
