to the bank should the bank experience financial distress payment of dividends the corporation may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed without objection by the federal reserve board dividends from the bank are a significant source of funds for the corporation and the corporations ability to pay dividends on its common stock therefore depends on the ability of the bank to pay sufficient dividends to the corporation various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank to the corporation without regulatory consent the bank may not pay any dividends if it is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividend would cause it to become undercapitalized in general the amount of dividends that may be paid in a calendar year is limited to its recent earnings the current years net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years or its undivided profits generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus whichever is less the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation may also be affected by the capital adequacy standards applicable to the bank discussed further below which include minimum requirements and buffers capital planning and stress testing the corporations capital distributions are subject to the federal reserve boards capital plan rules which require the corporation to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board for review the corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan to which the federal reserve board has not objected the major components of that oversight are the federal reserve boards comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar and doddfrank act stress tests dfast these requirements involve both companyrun and supervisoryrun testing of capital under various scenarios including baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator results from the corporations and the banks annual companyrun stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and made publicly available the corporation submitted its most recent capital plan to the federal reserve board in april as part of the federal reserve boards ccar exercise and the federal reserve board did not object to the corporations plan and proposed capital actions including authority to increase its dividend payments and share repurchases in mid2019 the regulatory relief act and the federal reserve boards tailoring rule implementing changes required by such act did not directly affect the ccar exercise or capital plan requirements that apply to the corporation the corporation remains subject to annual companyrun stress testing annual supervisory stress testing and annual capital plan submission requirements table start annual report northern trust corporation table end the corporation will submit its capital plan to the federal reserve board by april the federal reserve board is expected to publish either its objection or nonobjection to the capital plan and proposed capital actions such as dividend payments and share repurchases in mid2020 under the dfast regulations the corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve board annually the bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the corporation results from the corporations and the banks annual companyrun stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and made publicly available northern trust published the results of its companyrun stress tests on june and the results of its companyrun midcycle stress tests on october in april the federal reserve board proposed revisions to the ccar exercise and dfast regulations that would in part integrate the forwardlooking stress test results with the nonstress capital requirements discussed below by using the results of the annual supervisory stress test to set specific buffer requirements above minimum capital requirements which restrict capital distributions under the capital rule and establish a single approach to capital distribution limitations the april proposal also would replace the capital conservation buffer requirement discussed below with a stress capital buffer requirement and establish a stress leverage buffer requirement in addition to the minimum tier leverage ratio requirement under the april proposal an institution would be required to maintain capital ratios above its minimum plus its buffer requirements in order to avoid restrictions on its capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments an institution would be bound by the most stringent distribution limitations if any as determined by its capital conservation buffer requirement its stress leverage buffer requirement and if applicable its advanced approaches capital conservation buffer requirement and enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standard the april proposal also would remove the stress testing assumption that an institution would make all planned capital distributions over the planning horizon including any planned common stock dividends and repurchases of common stock instead the stress buffer requirements would include only four quarters of planned common stock dividends in order to preserve the incentives for an institution to engage in disciplined forwardlooking dividend planning further the april proposal would adjust the methodology used in the supervisory stress test to assume that the institution takes actions to maintain a constant level of assets including loans trading assets and securities over the planning horizon and assume that the institutions riskweighted assets and leverage ratio denominator generally remain unchanged over the planning horizon the april proposal also would remove the quantitative objection in ccar and eliminate the percent dividend payout ratio as a criterion for heightened scrutiny of an institutions capital plan the federal reserve board would retain the ccar qualitative supervisory review and the ability to object to an institutions capital plan on qualitative grounds based on the adequacy of the institutions capital planning processes for institutions supervised by the large institution supervision coordination committee and other large and complex institutions as of the date of this filing the federal reserve board has not finalized the april proposal and the corporation cannot predict whether it will be finalized and whether such finalization would alter the way in which the ccar exercise and dfast regulations are applied to the corporation capital adequacy requirements the corporation as a bank holding company is subject to riskbased and leverage capital guidelines implemented by the federal reserve board that are based on industrystandard guidelines published by the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee known as basel iii the bank as an fdicinsured depository institution is also required to meet riskbased and leverage capital guidelines established by regulators which are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies under the final basel iii rules the corporation with the bank is one of a small number of core banking organizations that are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their riskbased capital ratios the corporation also is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach to calculating riskbased capital ratios the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the two in the assessment of its capital adequacy table start annual report northern trust corporation table end the banks riskbased and leverage capital ratios at december were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by us banking regulators the

at least a supplementary leverage ratio to be considered wellcapitalized the corporation and bank are also subject to a capital conservation buffer which requires them to hold a buffer of common equity tier capital above the minimum riskbased capital requirements in order to avoid constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation the minimum capital conservation buffer increased to in from in a countercyclical buffer of to of a banking organizations total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation is also a component of the capital adequacy framework in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures the us countercyclical buffer is currently set at but certain other jurisdictions in which the corporation has credit exposures currently have countercyclical buffers set at levels greater than which slightly increase the weighted average countercyclical buffer to which the corporation is subject as discussed above in april the federal reserve board proposed revisions to the basel iii rules that would in part integrate the forwardlooking stress test results with the nonstress capital requirements discussed in this section if implemented the revisions would establish revised capital requirements for large banking organizations such as the corporation that are institutionspecific and risksensitive liquidity standards northern trust is subject to the us liquidity coverage ratio lcr requirement which is designed to ensure that covered banking organizations including the corporation and the bank maintain an adequate level of unencumbered highquality

with applicable lcr requirements basel iii also introduced the concept of a net stable funding ratio nsfr requirement designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a oneyear time horizon the nsfr will require certain banking organizations including the corporation to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and offbalancesheet activities the federal reserve board has proposed but has not adopted a final rule implementing the nsfr the enhanced prudential standards imposed by the doddfrank act
