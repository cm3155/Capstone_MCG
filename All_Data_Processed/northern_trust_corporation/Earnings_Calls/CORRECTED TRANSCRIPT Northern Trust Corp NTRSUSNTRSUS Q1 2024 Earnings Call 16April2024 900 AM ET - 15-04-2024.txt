michael g ogrady chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp thank you jennifer let me join in welcoming you to our first quarter earnings call were off to a good start for the year our results for the quarter reflect both strength in underlying equity markets and the solid progress were making against our strategic priorities of optimizing growth driving productivity and strengthening resiliency we generated organic growth relative to both the prior period and prior year and saw a healthy momentum in flows across our businesses within wealth management we continue to see solid growth in client advisory fees and product level fees increased due to favorable markets our global family office performed particularly well in the first quarter adding several high profile client relationships the launch of our book secrets of enterprising families and the nationwide events created around it have generated significant client engagement and proven to be an attractive source of new lead flow asset servicing generated solid new business growth at attractive margins in the first quarter as weve discussed our goal is to generate new business that is scalable this means a greater proportion of new mandates that require lower levels of incremental costs there were several notable wins in the quarter northern trust was appointed to provide a full suite of asset servicing solutions to true potential a rapidly growing ukbased wealth management firm supporting approximately billion in assets under management our open architecture approach derivatives expertise and consultative manner were key factors in helping us secure this win we were also appointed as the sole asset servicing provider for sanlam asset managements billion of funds domiciled in ireland the award builds upon an existing relationship with sanlam investments uk an integrated trading solutions client this win shows how increasingly our capital markets solutions are becoming leading products for us bringing new clients to the firm whose relationships then expand into core asset servicing and other ancillary products the progress were making and success were seeing from our one northern trust strategy is most evident within asset management by both enabling and encouraging teams to work in tight coordination were delivering clients the solutions and capabilities of the entire firm more joint meetings between our asset management and asset servicing businesses is leading to more new business opportunities and wins asset management has also bolstered the internal team that coordinates with our wealth management business and recently completed a national roadshow meeting with wealth clients and advisors in markets this provided increased visibility and the enhanced product leadership and performance which should lead to increased flows from wealth clients over time and in the first quarter asset management also launched several new laddered annuity products geared towards wealth clients and the proprietary offshore money market fund for japanese institutional clients overall asset management generated positive liquidity flows for the fifth consecutive quarter and continued to generate strong momentum within active fixed income and alternatives northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 in closing we entered the second quarter with strong market tailwinds and positive new business momentum and are wellpositioned to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic and market uncertainty and with that ill turn it over to jason to review our financial performance jason jason j tyler executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thank you mike and let me join jennifer and mike in welcoming you to our first quarter earnings call lets dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on page this morning we reported first quarter net income of million earnings per share of and our return on average common equity was as noted on the slide our reported results included a million loss on the sale of securities related to a repositioning of the portfolio we completed in january they also included a million fdic special assessment which is in addition to the million we recognized in the fourth quarter our assets under custody and administration and assets under management were up sharply on both a sequential and yearoveryear basis strong equity markets coupled with favorable client flows drove most of the improvement in both periods excluding notable items in all periods revenue was up on a sequential quarter basis and on a yearover year basis expenses were up sequentially and up over the prior year trust investment and other servicing fees totaled billion a sequential increase and a increase compared to last year excluding notables in both periods all other noninterest income on an fte basis was up sequentially and up over the prior year we experienced good momentum in our capital markets businesses particularly fx trading where we saw a strong client volume level bond underwriting referral fees were also unusually strong recognized within securities commission and trading income net interest income on an fte basis was million up sequentially and down from a year ago overall credit quality remains very strong our allowance for credit losses declined reflecting a reserve release of million and the impact of a million chargeoff during the quarter largely due to a large commercial loan nonperforming loan levels decreased from million to million the lowest level since and nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans remained stable at basis points turning to our asset servicing results on page assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were trillion at quarter end asset servicing fees totaled million custody and fund administration fees were million up yearoveryear reflecting the impact from strong underlying equity markets and new business activities other fees were up million sequentially due to seasonally higher fees for benefit payment services and other yearend activities assets under management for asset servicing clients were trillion investment management fees within asset servicing were million up a strong yearoveryear and sequentially northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 moving to our wealth management business on page assets under management for our wealth management clients were billion trust investment and other servicing fees for wealth management clients were million up yearoveryear and sequentially growth within our gfo business was particularly strong up yearoveryear and sequentially moving to page and our balance sheet and net interest income trends our average balance sheet increased on a linkedquarter basis primarily due to higher deposit levels it declined compared to the prior year due to lower borrowings average deposits were billion up nearly billion or from the fourth quarter and were meaningfully better than our expectations we experienced a strongerthanexpected surge in deposits late in the quarter with an ending balance up billion or to billion despite significant leverage capacity we reduced our average shortterm borrowings by relative to the fourth quarter and total borrowings by this translated to million in net interest income and a net interest margin of moving to the asset side of the balance sheet following the securities sales completed in november and january related to our portfolio repositionings and the increase in deposits average cash on our balance sheet increased by nearly billion or the duration of our securities portfolio is now years average loan balances were just below billion down both sequentially and relative to the prior year our endofperiod loan balances were again elevated at billion reflecting market timing dynamics our loans have since returned to approximately billion a heightened activity at the end of the quarter did not have a material impact on net interest income in either the first or second quarters the total balance sheet duration continues to be less than one year our average liquidity levels remain very strong with highly liquid assets comprising of our deposits and nearly of total earning assets on average our net interest income is highly sensitive to deposit levels and will continue to be driven largely by client deposit behavior assuming a stable rate environment minimal incremental pricing pressure and some variability in deposit volume we currently expect a to sequential decline in nii turning to page as reported noninterest expenses were billion in the first quarter down sequentially and up as compared to the prior year excluding notable items in both periods as listed on the slide expenses in the first quarter were up sequentially and up yearoveryear translates to a basis points of yearoveryear trust fee operating leverage in the quarter our expense to trust fee ratio however remained elevated ill hit on just a few highlights which exclude all notable items compensation expense was up a little over versus the prior year and up sequentially the sequential increase reflected approximately million in seasonal equity incentive payments and the impact of current year incentives from higher profitability fulltime equivalent head count was essentially flat sequentially and down or over the prior year non compensation expense was up yearoveryear mostly due to increased depreciation and amortization expense within equipment and software as new projects continue to be put into service and growth in tech spend and other consulting areas within outside services marketrelated expenses such as market data thirdparty advisory fees and costs associated with our supplemental pension plans which are sensitive to underlying equity and fixed income movements were also up million yearoveryear which added basis points to our expense growth northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 finally we experienced favorability in the occupancy line reflecting actions we took last year to rationalize our footprint as we look out into the second quarter ill touch on our largest expense categories compensation expense will no longer contain the seasonal equity incentives from  but will include the impact from last years base pay adjustments of million in the aggregate spread over the second third and fourth quarters it also reflects modest employee head count growth associated with growth in the underlying businesses all in this should translate to a sequential decrease of million to million within outside services we could see as much as a million to million sequential lift reflecting ongoing technology including costs related to cybersecurity and other resiliency expenditures we also expect to incur the lagged impact from various marketrelated fees within equipment and software we also expect to see a million to million sequential increase with roughly half as incremental depreciation and amortization sequentially growth was flat in the first quarter so theres some timingrelated impact but we dont expect to see the same stepup in the second half of the year our capital levels and regulatory ratios remain strong in the quarter and we continue to operate at levels well above our required regulatory minimums our common equity tier ratio under the standardized approach was flat with the prior quarter at as capital accretion offset a modest increase in riskweighted asset levels this reflects a basis point buffer above our regulatory requirements tier leverage ratio was down basis points from the prior quarter at quarter end our unrealized pretax loss on available for sale securities was million overall we returned million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of million and common stock repurchases of million with that natty please open the line for questions northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we will take our first question from alex blostein with goldman sachs jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi good morning jason and mike jennifer good morning everybody so wanted to start maybe with nii guidance down to for the second quarter it sounds like the biggest driver there is your assumptions around deposits so maybe give us a sense of kind of where deposits stand today perhaps what was the source of upside that you saw over the course of the quarter and then just curious on within that guide do you guys assume any benefits from the visa proceeds that im guessing is going to be at least temporarily parked in cash jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes so ill go through a couple dynamics there one just going back to the first quarter and what happened that we saw a really nice improvement in deposit levels and it was across both asset servicing and wealth management and the overall base increased nicely but that end of quarter level of billion there are some very chunky large clients that we always have in place and that sometimes can have lead to significant increases thats definitely the case at the end so we have seen deposits come down and in the first couple of weeks of the quarter and but that said the runup we had at the end of the quarter that wasnt really the driver of the average it happened very late in the quarter so the end of first quarter in general was good as we look out into second quarter weve got to remember that things like the buildup that we have in april for tax payments which frankly was part of the dynamic of where we ended the quarter that starts to go away as tax payments get made and so deposits come down thats one of the factors and so we could even at this point be at a peak for the quarter and then you asked about visa no significant lift from that in the quarter youre right its going to be parked at least in the short run weve got ideas on what to do there but in the very short run it would be parked in cash but not a significant lift the impact is more from a capital and leverage perspective more than nii in the short run and just alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i got it jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp in general weve got to remember this has just been it has been very hard to predict deposit levels and its not us driving it were we did a lot of work with clients to make sure they know that we want deposits and feel like we did a really good job on that but this has been the most difficult area of the income statement to predict northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i got you yes no all makes sense i guess as a followup to that so well stick with the nii related questions you guys saw a pretty meaningful pickup in cash as you highlighted so 10billionish sequentially how are you guys thinking about redeploying that over time should we generally expect the cash balances on the asset side of the balance sheet to remain fairly elevated especially given the sort of uncertain rates backdrop and perhaps higher for longer or at what point do you feel comfortable extending that into securities jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes its another dynamic that feeds into your first question actually that we brought duration of the securities portfolio and more importantly which feeds into your question the duration of the balance sheet is very short right now that was strategic we felt like that was the right thing to do thats a big part of why we did the repositioning of the balance sheet but at a point we also might take the opportunity to extend a little bit usually the rate curve means that that would be helpful but in this rate curve environment you might end up giving a little bit giving up a little bit of nim and so and youre right that cash very elevated part of that is because of the chunky nature of some of the deposits and you just want to stay very short there and but part of it has been strategic as weve let a lot of maturities just roll and then obviously the repositioning was done intending to come to the shorter part of the yield curve but where were now and our anticipation of our view of the yield curve were more at a neutral point right now and depending on what we see in the economy might take an opportunity to step out alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i got you all makes sense thanks very much jason jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure thanks operator we will take our next question from ebrahim poonawala jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning ebrahim how are you ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning jason how are you so i guess maybe moving on expenses i just wanted to make sure we heard you right comp expense is down about million to million sequentially and then i think youve accounted services and equipment and software both up million to million quarteroverquarter jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thats right northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc so does that imply relatively flat expenses in and i guess the question is just give us some visibility around youve talked previously about the focus in terms of flexing expenses lower bringing the expense growth below last years just give us a sense of the work thats being done your level of confidence in terms of hitting some of those targets around the expense to trust fee asset ratio jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah so first of all that goal of or below that is still the goal and secondly its early in the year and we got through first quarter and a little bit above that but at the same time were still working very hard to get expenses down and the numbers that we gave in the opening give a sense of some of the bigger line items but there are other areas where were continuing to push and even on those items were continuing to push hard were constantly trying to find opportunities to get expenses down enormous focus inside the company and youre right to confirm the numbers that we had there things like outside services where weve got tech services and even cloud migration and consulting those are all areas where weve seen some elevation all for strategic reasons but weve got to find productivity and make sure were finding efficiencies to get expenses where we want them to be early in the year and were still pushing for that or better ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just i guess one followup to jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah one thing just sorry to interrupt ebrahim yeah i think as we think about the first quarter of the year i think people should also appreciate how much the lift in markets had an impact on our expenses and so you think about things anywhere from market data to thirdparty advisory fees to subcustody and referenced it quickly earlier on but even something like the markets impact on our supplemental benefit plans has significant impact on expenses but for that supplemental benefit plan expense theres an offsetting increase in revenues theres no impact to profitability so got to put that aside a little bit but the lift in markets definitely has an impact and so a lot of the work that weve done in the first quarter and over the last year it masked a little bit but thats just something we should all keep in mind as weve gone through this period of the sp being up yearoveryear to on a sequential quarter basis that plays into expenses as well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thanks thanks for that and just one quick followup appreciate that its very hard to sort of handicap deposit behavior but just give us a sense of pricing competitively have things stabilized gotten better today versus three or six months ago thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 pricing specifically in which michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp deposits deposits jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp in deposits yeah we did see and one of the biggest benefits we had in the quarter was that pricing came through better than we anticipated we actually were up a couple basis points in nim and had anticipated that to go in the opposite direction and so and weve been a broken record saying that were not a price maker or a price taker in this but i think a lot of the work that we did communicating with clients and bringing on highquality deposits it helped and so it appears that that pricing pressure that we were experiencing very significantly in the third quarter in particular it has abated things less pressure on that dynamic right now ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp you bet operator we will take our next question from ken usdin with jefferies jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning ken how are you doing ken if youre talking youre muted mokshith reddy q analyst jefferies llc hey guys this is mokshith on behalf of ken could you just talk about your servicing pipelines and just your wealth management growth just some more color on that would be fantastic jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure mike michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure ill start off with wealth management so we did see nice organic growth in the first quarter and we expect that to continue as we go forward as was mentioned in the commentary there i continued to see it on the advisory fee side of the equation and also weve gone through a number of quarters where the product level fees in wealth management have been more of a headwind just related to flows in some of the specific asset categories and we saw that subside in the first quarter so we expect that to also be a positive going forward northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 and you heard our family office business growing at a higher rate in the first quarter also seeing strength in ultrahigh net worth which those are the two segments that were primarily focused on and i would say in asset servicing the growth has been relatively broadbased certainly seeing strength with asset owners in north america but also in europe as well so that has been a positive and were seeing that outside of ill say core asset servicing with the capital markets area being an area where with integrated trading solutions were seeing that as a ill say increasingly utilized area for us to generate new relationships and then broaden them out from there so i feel good about the breadth of the organic growth in that business as well mokshith reddy q analyst jefferies llc got it just another question on just flow of client assets between cash and feegenerating and where that stands jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes so overall the cash has been obviously a positive story not just in deposits but also in our money market mutual fund complex which is up meaningfully sequentially and yearoveryear and our that complex is very important to us its highly profitable its large so our most sophisticated clients see it as a good opportunity to invest there with good yield with the benefits of being in a collective fund but at the same time not having significant concentration and so the overall liquidity in cash in the investment management business but also in the broader financial model has played very significantly into the strength of the quarter mokshith reddy q analyst jefferies llc thanks for taking my questions jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp of course operator we will take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp good morning betsy nice to hear you northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp welcome back betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh good thanks just wanted to make sure you could hear me so i guess two questions one on capital and i realize that your business model is one that is capitalrich and just wanted to understand how you think about capital levels capital accretion and whens the right time to start leaning in more to buybacks given the excess capital that you have jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp so the youre right that the capital levels are strong and even with where we are right now at in cet1 id argue that thats a little artificially low right now we talked about the fact that loans are elevated because of the operational dynamics at the end of the quarter and so betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp we expect rwa is already down as a result of loan volumes which we mentioned earlier coming back more to normal levels plus weve got million in aoci pulling to par plus weve got visa and plus were still returning on an operating basis at a good level and so those are all good there are also youre right to note that we like having strong capital levels and still able to develop good returns at these levels and we also are always looking at where our peers are to make sure that when we say strong its not just absolute but relative now all that said particularly with visa coming online you can imagine likely its going to have an upward impact on the trajectory of share repurchase its not like were going to do something enormous right away but it goes into our capital framework and with capital levels being higher as a result of that and even in anticipation of it it obviously will have an upward lift all other things equal betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great and then separate question just on i think you mentioned earlier about opportunities to extend duration in the book in the securities book at some point and maybe you could just give us some context and color as to how youre thinking about that given the fact that typically you have a very very short duration so when you say longer duration what are you thinking about in terms of how long is long thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes thats a good focus everythings relative so we had gotten out to about two years on the securities portfolio a couple of years ago and now being meaningfully under one year it gives you at least some sense of range but i also think its important to note everybody should take a lesson from what weve seen in the markets over the last couple in banking over the last year that deposits have a shorter duration than anybody anticipated northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 and so on bias were going to be shorter relative to history than what we have been before but were quite short right now and particularly as deposits seem to be leveling off in general and a little bit more predictable it gives us an opportunity and more confidence and then we have to test do we see the investment opportunities and does the yield curve indicate to us that it makes sense to go out and thats part of the reason that weve been shorter we felt like it was that it was going to be better to be at the short end of the curve over the last year that led to that repositioning work that we did and so its not going to be dramatic but it any given the way the shape of the yield curve is right now any stepout protects us nicely from significant declines in shortterm rates but it gives up a little bit in short term nii betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah got it okay thank you thats very clear jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp great operator we will take our next question from brennan hawken with ubs jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank good morning thanks for taking my questions hi how are you jason had a couple of followups one on the deposit front jason you commented how deposits have declined but it seemed like you were commenting more on an eop basis than versus the average we saw the average balances of above that ph billion to billion range that you had previously talked about and we saw some stability in noninterest bearing so when we think about the goforward on an average basis is have we hit a level where now things should be relatively stable comparing it to where we were on an average basis i appreciate that you said this is the hardest part of the balance sheet to predict so i recognize im asking a challenging question jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes yes i think i said our overall financial results to predict its been really hard thats a youre right to point out that the billion the comments i made were relative to the billion we have seen obviously the balance has come down we naturally do the first couple of weeks of the quarter but this dynamic of tax payments is one that can have an impact and also just the fact that clients may be doing exactly what we were talking about a minute ago with betsys question of thinking about redeploying out of cash into different types of securities and maybe buying treasuries that has that dynamic as well or maybe moving into money market funds to pick up even if its not six months or two years of duration picking up in days northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 and so all those dynamics have a downward impact on average deposits and we just want to make sure were prepared for that as we think about the scenarios were trying to give you guys a reasonable estimate of the upside downside that we feel and but that having deposits down meaningfully in the quarter is thats inside our expectation of what could happen michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp and brennan its mike just to add at a very macro level i if you just look at deposits starting back pre pandemic and then quantitative easing obviously had a very meaningful impact on those deposit levels going up and then we saw the reverse with quantitative tightening and so some of this will depend on just the broader macro impact of tightening and when the fed and other central banks decide to stop bringing down the size of their balance sheet and i think then well reach a new level of normalization of deposit levels and right now were i would say well above the prepandemic prequantitative easing levels so to the extent that were closer to the end of quantitative tightening the expectation would be that we start to settle out somewhere in this neighborhood operator we will take our next question from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and good morning and good morning if i can ask my first question on nii so just looking at the second half and of course everythings difficult to predict with deposits and everything but if you can just talk about how visa might work its way i think theres a couple of stages of deployment so its more of a and lift versus i think you said it was pretty minimal for the guide so maybe just talk about the timing of that and then i guess do you see a scenario in which you might actually have positive net interest revenue growth in versus given the really strong start to the year jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so just on timing of visa youre right well be able to get a portion of it done in second here in the second quarter but some of it will bleed over into third quarter and if youre just correlating to whats the impact on nii obviously that it doesnt have that much lift just because were not getting as much timing from it but youre right there will be some lift but ill come back to the the biggest benefit visa is more on its capital and our liquidity if you think about the most simplest component of putting those dollars at the fed at ioer or iorb then you dont get a dramatic lift beyond what would happen with a billion or million deposit coming in and so at northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 no cost but its not that dramatic of an impact and so the real help is a little bit longer term and us being able to think about strategic ways to deploy that and ensuring that we get a good return on it so were trying to keep a lot of different ph paths open and again this is also half of the position that were talking about this year theres still another half to come hopefully next year and some of that may bleed further brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then on the possibility for nii growth in given the strong start jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah i think its i mean you started with it its so early in the year to predict that and to predict where things go were still getting some lift from different components of maturities coming in and in other elements and so there are some tailwinds that we have but its very difficult to predict that far out brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great yes and then just on expenses the second quarter the numbers you gave obviously those are just the biggest categories but it looks to me like that implies maybe a million to million drop in expenses from the guidance that you gave not including other things just i guess if you can confirm if its accurate and then based on your comments of working harder on expenses and getting some of this what looks to be some of that seasonal lift in the second half kind of getting pulled forward should we maybe expect less expense build in the second half versus the second quarter that we typically see on the seasonal lift and then putting that all together is i know youre targeting obviously positive operating leverage on fees but if you actually have a good nii backdrop may we actually potentially see positive operating leverage inclusive of nii indiscernible jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah so im going to hit the second and third parts of that you broke up on the first im going to ask you to repeat it when i go through part of it on brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp the second half lift in expenses youre absolutely right second quarter is a big stepup its a big stepup in both outside services and equipment and software not seeing those types of increases in the second half at all not saying theyre going to be flat but definitely not thats not the trajectory that we will be on and were working very hard to find productivity and a lot of that can be inside this year and so still work to be done there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 and then as we think about fee operating leverage thats what we focus a lot on i mean the nii is unpredictable and its less correlated from a management perspective to expenses and so the real focus is on fee operating leverage and thats how we think about the financial model and ensuring that were being disciplined about the expenses relative to what were bringing on mike talked about bringing on more scalable business that improves our chances of getting good fee operating leverage but wouldnt comment on overall operating leverage given the volatility and lack of controllability in nii but tell me what tell me what we missed on the first part of your question brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc it was just a technical on the guidance you gave for i think it implies expenses down like million to million versus just on at least the categories that you talked about and the three different ranges that you put out there i just want to make sure that was i want to confirm that was accurate jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah let me i can go through the brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp i can go through the chunks that we talked about really quickly so the implication would be that compensation will be down million to million and equipment and software and outside services each up million to million brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes okay great great thank you very much jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp you bet brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes operator we will take next question from david smith with autonomous research jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 hi david david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning just speaking a bit more about balance sheet positioning setting aside the somewhat artificial nature of the 10k asset sensitivity disclosures that everyone has can you give us your best realworld guess right now for the incremental nii impact of more versus fewer fed cuts putting both pricing and balance sheet volume dynamics together jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah its assuming right youre right to point to the supplemental disclosures have the sensitivities to it but if youre thinking more about those are more stressed up basis points basis points and more if youre thinking more about single or double rate cuts then its difficult to its actually difficult to tell and you can see just assuming whats more likely of a 25basispoint or 50basispoint decline were going to be following the market and what happens there and theres scenarios in which you could see banks trying to hold on to deposits and others saying that they want to hold on to margin and so even on the way up it was not a linear exercise for us the betas were very low at the beginning of the increase and then at the end of the increasing cycle the betas were very very high in some instances over and so its just difficult to predict right now theres no science we debate internally even what the most likely impact is for these first couple of cuts on the way down david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and then one other nii followup do you think youre done with securities repositionings at this point or could we see another one later in the year jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp unlikely well see another one we got a lot of the a lot of what we did a lot of the very low yielding securities and remember theres real benefit from a capital perspective as well and being able to take some of the securities that had negative rwa treatment and reinvest those in cash at a point in the yield curve where we felt thats where we wanted to be incrementally from a strategic perspective from an investment perspective and also have improvement from the capital perspective that trade each time weve done it that component of the repositioning has lessened an impact and so it is much less likely but thats just given the current state of the yield curve and how we feel about the economic environment david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and lastly anything you can do to help us think about using the visa proceeds for organic versus inorganic investment opportunities northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes its were obviously looking really hard at ways internally to make sure were investing anywhere we can to grow at attractive capital levels our return on capital is targets are to and were putting that same type of framework in place as this capital comes in and to the extent the best thing we can do is grow with our existing types of businesses and with our existing yes with our existing clients that said we have not been short capital before and so its not like there are things we could do but we couldnt afford it from a capital perspective and so its not like theres a laundry list of things we can say oh now we can go get this done and so were going to be prudent and patient but at the same time not hesitate to reflect our capital framework which at this point would indicate all other things equal a little bit bias heavier on share repurchase david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp thats helpful thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator we will take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hello steve sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning this is its actually sharon leung filling in for steven this morning just a quick followup on noninterestbearing deposits they seem to have stabilized this quarter and are now about of the total do you think that this is kind of like a good trough level even if you see continued deposit pressures related to qt et cetera jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp its definitely flattened out in terms of even the percentage decline despite the fact that we had an overall increase in deposits and so noninterestbearing deposits performed well relative to what we would have expected and definitely seem to have flattened out it didnt grow as much as the rest of the base but performed well in the period so im not predicting a significant movement down at this point sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc okay great and then just a followup on aum and auc growth we saw healthy expansion but can you talk about what maybe drove some of this pressure on fee rates across your businesses this quarter northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes the fee rates i think is i always caution to focus on that when we apply it to our asset levels whether its on assets under management or assets under custody because only a portion of the business roughly half is even tied to asset levels and then a lot of the contracts that we have get to transaction volumes and then there are significant mix shift of areas like our family office business are going to have a lower overall yield on assets relative to the regions in wealth management for example and then theres other components in asset servicing that are very similar and so we actually dont do a lot of analysis on as were unpacking the quarter or the year were not looking at those rate changes as the biggest indicators of whats happening in the business were looking more granularly at whats happening with our clients the mix within different products and whats happening in the regions and family office et cetera sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc great thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator we do not have any further questions i would like to turn the call back over to jennifer childe for closing remarks jennifer childe senior
