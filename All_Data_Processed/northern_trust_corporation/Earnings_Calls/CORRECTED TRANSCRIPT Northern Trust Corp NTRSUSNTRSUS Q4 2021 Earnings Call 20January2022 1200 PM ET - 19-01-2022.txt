i would be happy to answer your questions elli will you please open the line northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 question and answer section operator of course thank you operator instructions and well go ahead and take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp good morning glenn jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp hi glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc good morning how are you so a quick question for you on that last comment you made about focusing all those things you are not alone there and so you had nice fee operating leverage for the year the fee to the expense ratio came up a little bit obviously because it was a super low number in the third quarter so as you balance all those things as we look out into can that be the same key focus that its been in the past as you balance all those things meaning youll get the benefit of rates over time but the cost inflation is here now so should we be prepared for being a tougher year for that metric jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah we should glenn i mean then youre hitting on an important point which is that we all are seeing the prospective rates and we are extremely leveraged to the front end of the rate curve both in nii and also in waivers obviously but the inflation is thats hitting faster and we saw it in third quarter as we were looking at incentive comp accruals we saw it in fourth quarter as we made some offcycle adjustments which we can talk about in salaries but that inflationary component by the way its not just in compensation it shows up in other areas of the income statement its going to hit first but at the same time the leverage we have to the front end of the yield curve means that when rates do go up its extremely beneficial to us and weve been talking about that for two years obviously how much net interest margin and also waivers in the money market products have been impacted glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc i appreciate all that ill let one of my peers ask on the nii stuff i did want to ask a quick question on organic growth as a followup you mentioned that you spoke to it its clearly there because you can see it in your asset growth but can you talk about whether it be new business wins in asset servicing and asset management or a one but not yet funded pipeline thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 sure thanks glenn both of the businesses and as you know when we talk about the organic growth we tend to talk about yearoveryear not on a linked quarter basis and thats a really important distinction that said and you touched on it both asset servicing and wealth management had good lift from an organic perspective year overyear and frankly in the quarter as well and so you saw weve been talking about increased momentum in the wealth management business youre starting to see that come through with higher fees on a quarterover quarter basis thats driven by new business and we get the same effect coming in asset servicing the pipeline in both of the businesses in the short run it looks strong the pipeline for the businesses has different timing but in both instances theyre reflecting good activity in new business and i think in the cis in particular they see good activity overall in the front end it might be a little bit different the back end is a little bit harder to tell glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure thanks glenn operator and well move on to our next question from steven chubak from wolfe research please go ahead michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning everyone so wanted to start with just a question on capital management as you noted capital ratios continue to be quite strong i believe jason on the last call you had talked to or spoken to the fact that the rwa inflation the loan growth was consuming a lot of the capital bill that you guys were generating this quarter that wasnt the case we didnt really see any rwa growth and yet you tempered the buyback i was hoping you can give some perspective as to what informed that decision and how should we be thinking about the pace of buyback from here especially if the pace of rwa growth does begin to moderate jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure well a couple thoughts there one just for the quarter the rwa growth is one dynamic but of course aoci hits capital and thats another dynamic we have to manage as well which is why we were flattish quarter overquarter that said as we think about the overall i know a lot of people are wondering what our game plan is from a buyback perspective if you just take its a good time to just take a look back at the year and we generated billion in capital last year from earnings and so you take a step back and just say just the math youre doing where did the billion go well we did return million to shareholders in the form of dividends over the course of the year but we very intentionally grew the loan book we saw highquality opportunities on the horizon and we wanted to be there for clients and northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 so you look yearoveryear and loans are up billion and even within this quarter they are up billion or billion and so and if you think about where our capital ratios are that billion increase in loans that drives that takes another million in the capital that we generated and so you look at dividends and what happened with loans thats right there thats of the capital we generated now even so we did buybacks in the year about million and so thats why you saw cet1 drift down a little bit but the next important question is is the loan growth good and it was very good its good strategically for us because we supported clients but its also good economically if you think about the roe of loans its very attractive particularly in a low interest rate environment and so we feel really good with what we did in in the door was closed last year we think we did the right thing for clients and shareholders by growing relationships and earnings but as youre trying to predict what were going to do in its very different we dont see the same loan growth on the horizon and we even talked about the fact that some of the loan growth weve had is in some of the areas of our business where it can be very spiky and just as our clients put on they can put on billion or billion or billion in a deposit they can do the same thing in lending and so we could see lending be spiky both up and down but dont see that same type of billion growth yearoveryear steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no thanks for that color jason and just for my followup wanted to ask sorry about that on the expense side you did give that perspective noting that on an adjusted basis the expenses grew to this past year obviously we had some nice market tailwinds which will drive some impact on the variable expense lines but as we think about some of the inflationary pressures that started to manifest late last year and are going to continue into this year versus that up to that you had talked about in should we expect the expense growth to be similar or even above that given the inflationary pressures that you spoke to jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp let me hit the big three maybe ill hit comp and then ill hit technology which gets it outside services and equipment and software expense if you look at the comp line given weve already seen some inflation hit that line this year and you see just the increase in comp this quarter linked quarter million of that alone came from salaries and the impact of what weve done in these offcycle adjustments not done yet and so just from the actions weve already taken were going to see another million lift in the comp line just from those salary adjustments secondly theres what are we going to do with our normal base pay adjustments which is that starts in second quarter but thats going to be higher and its reflective of inflation its usually we see that be an million to million a quarter impact this year its going to be more like million a quarter and so those salary actions combined are going to give just in and of itself thatll lift the total comp line yearoveryear for the year and on top of it we then have to think about what hiring are we going to do and what other adjustments might wed have to take but that at least gives you a lens of what we can see at this point now let me switch to tech and thats the other area where all financial services companies are spending a lot of time and a lot of investment that hits us all across the pl but mostly in outside services in equipment and software and you saw big sequential increases of about in both of those categories this quarter but as we look forward very different impacts of what we think is going to be existing in northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 in outside services theres tech services within that category a lot of project work that were doing we got a lot of that done in fourth quarter we do not see significant impact and significant lift in in outside services in fact the number you see now for fourth quarter thats a good starting point for and any motion from there is going to be driven more by business activity and obviously theres a lot of businessrelated activity in that line item that could drive it but the tech component largely done from an increase perspective equipment and software very different we are on a ramp there again increase there we ended that year well where the category was up yearoveryear over were going to see that same type of lift in that category in maybe slightly higher so what are we doing there its really four factors one depreciation and that alone is we know we can see as we sit today thats going to be up million or million so just depreciation which is kind of in the bank at this point we know its going to grow equipment and software by about alone and we know that there are some other increases coming two inflation of the underlying costs and that hits in different ways three were continuing to invest in technology to get stronger and maintain a very strong foundation and then lastly business growth including digital so a lot of investment going on there in a handful of different categories but those are the three big categories of expenses to give you a sense of what we know at this point steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no very helpful breakdown thanks so much for taking my questions michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp thanks operator well take our next question from ken usdin from jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks and good morning jason you mentioned earlier that the company is meaningfully asset sensitive and i wanted to ask you your disclosures in the 10q and k give you an expected change over base forecasts but i wonder if you could give us a more simple way of thinking about this cycle what each basis points of rates would give you in terms of nii dollars jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure well first of all and you know this really well its not linear and so let me give me you the first one i wish that the fourth and fifth were the same but the first alone is at a high level if you think about weve got about billion in floating rate earning assets and we think well get about a million lift on a quarterly basis alone on the asset side well give up maybe million of that in higher borrowing cost so thats net million before we really talk about significant data but we think that first lift is probably in that million a quarter range now that first lift it also gets to waivers ken and so and weve talked about the fact that our money market mutual fund family is its priced much more institutionally and so it only takes one lift to work fully through the duration of the portfolio to get the vast if not all of the waivers off the table as well and as you know this past quarter we waived million and run rate on thats lower now but so i think its important to think about both northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 of those go back to nii as we get those second third fourth rate hikes then thats when we start to give up some of the gain coming from deposit cost ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah yeah perfect and then just second one quickly on cis you mentioned lower transaction activity that line was flattish can you just kind of give us a help on magnitude on what type of holdback that might have been and maybe just talk through fx translation headwinds as well jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure its interesting as we talk about transaction costs and transaction volume i think people look to fx and they look to security commissions and trading even within the custody and fund administration fees theyre transactionrelated fees that feed into that line and so thats what were referencing when were saying that those costs were lower in the quarter and so and youll note in fx for example good quarter and so this transaction volumes in fx and other areas were high but within as we really dug into why what happened within the custody and fund admin lines weve been seeing that within cis it was more the transaction component the nonasset the auc nonaumbased fees that were light in the quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and was i guess was that meaningful and was fx translation a meaningful headwind this quarter too sequentially jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah yeah mark go ahead mark mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah and ken its mark combined youre looking at about there with the transactionbased fees being more than half of that so the two were a id say a fairly significant drag when you look at custody and fund administration on a sequential basis ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp thanks ken operator well take our next question from alex blostein from goldman sachs please go ahead northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp hi alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks good hey guys good morning everybody so a couple of questions around the rate dynamics i guess as we think about your deposit betas and i appreciate nobody has a crystal ball but as you think about the current cycle versus the prior cycle has the nature of the deposit base changed much for us to sort of contemplate as we think about deposit betas over the next several quarters right so or do you think the experience you guys saw in the last cycle is a pretty good one as a sort of benchmark for deposit betas this time around jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp its we talk about it a lot and ive thrown out to our team is it similar to last time and its hard to tell what i can give you some facts that and its less to the deposit beta but more to this the overall asset sensitivity of the securities portfolio on the balance sheet the duration has come down from i think last quarter it was and now its at and ironically though if you look at the duration of the overall asset side of the balance sheet cumulatively its much higher than what it was in the prior cycle and so i can actually tell you this as it sits right now its about and if you go back to the last tightening cycle it was and so its thats meaningfully different now we have to see how the deposits specifically react but that at least gives you a sense of what the exposure of the overall balance sheet is like but mark i dont know if you have anything to add mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp and the other thing that weve heard as well from our team to keep in mind alex is the trajectory of the rates i think last time the rate hike started much slower jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp right mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp than what it appears that might happen this time so you might go through those rising betas in a quicker way because of that so well have to see how that plays out as well alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 got it thanks for that and then my followup is around i guess expenses again and jason i appreciate you guys giving different pieces and thats helpful and i obviously acknowledge that you guys dont give flatout guidance in terms of expense growth i do like the way you talk about expenses to fees as a ratio and that got to some of the glenns point as well but if you guys are at around by our math in terms of expense to fees in you talked about inflationary pressures but also youre getting money market fees back likely in which i would have thought would come in at a really high kind of incremental margin so when you blend it all together netnet were staying kind of in this range for and beyond as we kind of think about that ratio as a guidepost sort of thing between the revenues and expenses michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp alex its mike i think your framework is correct or at least i would say aligned with the way that were looking at it as well of course we dont know what the market levels are going to be and how quickly the fee waivers come back and obviously were managing through the expense side of that but to your point of kind of being in a range of ill call it efficiency there were in that range and particularly in a inflationary environment that can be challenging to try to get that ratio to go down and as jason alluded to earlier where you really see the other side of the coin if you will is on interest rates and therefore nii that then drops down to operating leverage and so in the same way were saying okay stay in that expense to trust fee ratio as far as efficiency but then look to pick up through nii so that you have positive operating leverage and youre your pretax margin is in that range that you want to get the right returns alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah that makes sense thats consistent with kind of how were thinking okay awesome thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp thanks alex operator well go ahead and take our next question from brennan hawken from ubs please go ahead michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp hi brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc hey thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to follow up circle back a little bit on capital and pull together a couple of the comments that you made on that jason it seemed like what you said was that in the current quarter there were some aoci consumption of capital and while you had billionsomeodd base of loan growth the outlook for the loan growth is swelling and not really there so number one does that mean that your further consumption of capital on the loan growth side may swell of course that could be a hand off to aoci northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 and then number two when you talked about the billion versus the million it seemed like that suggested a pretty high riskweight density in the loan book can you talk about the riskweight that you have in that loan book and what kind of loans are driving that growth thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure well let me start with the end but dont let me forget the first part of it the loans that we have are and you can see it in our reporting its the first cut is its weighted more heavily toward wealth management obviously and within that its a blend of personal commercial real estate corporate commercial and the risk rates on those dont vary dramatically from a risk weight allocation perspective and so at a really high level that you can just you look at what our outstandings are and its not going to vary within those categories significantly now then theres also some off balance sheet commitments that arent reflected there but that gives you a general sense and weve talked about and i could now if youd like if its helpful to give you more of a breakdown of the loans and what they look like by category but and the growth has actually been relatively consistent if you think about the increase just for example if youre trying to do the math there if i look at increase in loans from third quarter to fourth quarter commercial has been about it is up about billion commercial about million and personal loans about million commercial real estate million and then some other stuff with the remainder and so you can tell its relatively consistent to our overall volumes in the billion portfolio if i come back to your first brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah go ahead jason sorry i was going to just to remind you about the first part thats all youre on thanks jason jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp i am notoriously bad at multiple car park questions you got to remind me we just dont we dont see the same outlook on loan growth and i think you couple that with again we had we generated billion in capital and were starting and if we do get what we walked through earlier if we get multiple rate hikes and we start to have improvement from a net interest margin perspective we start waivers start to go away then the nav becomes different and we can think about different ways to return that capital generated to shareholders and we obviously we go through the same framework that we always have we think about the dividend first to make sure that its something were comfortable with and its within the range weve talked about and then we start to look at the outlook for the size of the balance sheet to stay within a range that we feel is appropriate given all the dynamics weve talked about historically brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc excellent that was very thorough and helpful and you touched on the size of the balance sheet there so maybe id like to ask for the followup when you think about deposit runoff because you typically with the business northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 model you tend to see deposit growth when the fed is expanding its balance sheet and runoff when its shrinking but last cycle the runoff for northern for you guys was less than it was for some of the other custody bank peers so when you think about whats driven the deposit growth at different types of businesses that have driven the deposit growth for the past two years is it largely does it look similar to how it looked last cycle or has the composition of deposit growth shifted which might suggest we should think about deposit runoff in a different way jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp i look at it a little bit differently one is i think we have to look at just whats happened with the asset values and if you go back to the end of prehealth crisis and you look at whats happened with the sp from then to now the sp is up something like its something like and if you look at our deposits on average we went from averaging billion to billion up to billion to billion its a very similar increase and then the second thing to look at is whats operational versus nonoperational and did we have similar growth did all of the growth come in nonoperational deposits and the answer is absolutely not more of our growth has come in operational deposits and then the third dynamic which you got at is there is just this overwhelming dynamic of the fed having put trillions of dollars of liquidity into the market and whatever our little tiny billion balance sheet looks like theres its still going to be impacted by what the fed does and so you put all those things together and you just i dont think there is reason to believe at this point from what we see just from that data that theres some massive unwinding coming now it could come but those data points tell you that not necessarily brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it thats helpful thanks jason jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator well go ahead and take the next question from brian bedell from deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp hey brian northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning jason thanks for all that color on the expense areas and great granularity to indiscernible one followup on just a couple more areas and thats just the northern trust open i think obviously youre not doing that this year but i think you alluded to in the past of potentially doing a marketing campaign in its place and then maybe just any commentary around the travel potentially higher travel expenses if were all back to office and covid hopefully recedes jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah so maybe ill touch on travel and business promo and then maybe mike can talk about golf tournament so were seeing business promo pick up again it was up in fourth quarter and so and no ones cringing at that i mean it means that were in front of clients more and so is it going to get back to the levels we saw before boy thats highly highly unlikely but already partially in the run rate in fourth quarter and in other expenses and we do expect that to continue to come now its not thats not adding million a quarter in expenses but it is adding to the expense run rate mike do you want to touch on golf michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure and the golf tournament has been a very successful marketing effort and client entertainment effort for us particularly around branding and as much as weve ended that relationship at this point we still need to continue to invest in the brand and so some of the proceeds that are the funds that are deployed for that brand building through the golf tournament are being redeployed in other areas at this point brian its not going to be at the same levels as what we are spending on the golf tournament brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then maybe just on expenses overall i mean its actually a pretty good playbook over the last years in terms of your expense history with a pretty reliable middle singledigit type of expense growth in each year which kind of i think technical difficulty jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp i think we lost you brian maybe mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp if he requeues jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp maybe brian northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp maybe you could requeue and we could take that mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp otherwise weve got i think one more elli do you want to alex can you hear us youre next in queue alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i could hear you guys i dont know if im speaking live michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp we can hear you so go for it alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc oh great sorry so thanks for taking the followup here so loud and clear on the deposit trajectory in terms of the sizing on the balance sheet im curious how that could play out with money market funds because that industry has obviously seen tremendous amount of inflows as well if you go to the last cycle its really not that clear there was a huge amount of decline in money market fund balances as the fed started to unwind their policies in qe how are you guys thinking about the sustainability of all the market share gains youve seen in the money market fund space because that will obviously inform the amount of money market fee waivers thats going to come back so 80ish million dollars is kind of what youre waiting today per quarter all of it is presumably going to come back with the first hike but that obviously seems the balance should stay in the same place jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah so i think the similar math that we went through earlier on the deposits i mean we were at something like billion in aum precrisis and then we ended at billion we ended at billion and i can tell you as we sit day before yesterday we were at billion so it came down a little but we have gained market share by any measure that we look at and thats not we dont think its accidental we did a lot of things related to cutoff times and the investment performance has been exceptional in those funds and so we think weve earned higher market share there and i think its tough to tell theres not just what happens as clients unwind but theres also the prospect of regulation in the fund industry and as you know in europe theres much more of a demand for large institutional clients to use balance sheets as opposed to funds and well see what happens here if theres a shift and its one of the reasons why weve done other things to try to launch new products to help our clients on liquidity to be able to provide other services and to be a thirdparty repo provider and to launch new funds that are more appealing with better cutoff times northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 and so well see what comes there but the best defense we can have in the short run is having a good liquid balance sheet and have availability to bring on deposits if our clients want to which is one of the reasons we always leave room to try and to bring more onto the balance sheet thats why our leverage ratios have tended to be strong alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it all right awesome thanks for the followup operator and well go ahead and move back to brian bedell please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc oh great thanks sorry about that indiscernible can you hear me now jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp youre good youre good brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thank you sorry about that yeah the followup was also in expenses and i dont know if you heard me start the question it was really about your expense growth on an annual basis its been pretty reliable over the last decade annually in that midsingle digit area almost exactly on an annualized basis which i know you tried to target some natural organic revenue growth however in the last tightening cycle in it was more elevated naturally in that to area given obviously the leverage from rates and i just wanted to get a sense of is that and as we think about sort of the trajectory is that a reliable type of indicator versus sort of the average over the last years jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp couple of thoughts and then mike may jump in as well one i dont in this cycle things are driven less by what is the fed doing to control growth its what is the fed doing to control inflation and inflation is correlated to our cost base and so were going to feel that and thats going to be different and walking through the expenses earlier just in the comp line having a growth there and then equipment and software having a growth at or above the we had yearoveryear you can tell were in a mode where were feeling expense growth over time thats just got upward pressure on it now the good thing is that the growth in the business is good and the benefit coming from rates which is its not distinct its correlated to the inflation when inflation exists we are getting a benefit partially coming from the fact that the fed is fighting that inflation with higher rates and luckily we have good leverage in that and when we walked through earlier on this call the impact to nii and the impact to fees and so its good but i dont think that historical is necessarily something wed look at and say is that the right target given the environment were in today mike northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp just to add yeah just to add on that brian is the reality is to serve our clients but equally important to compete and win in the marketplace we need the best people and we need digital capabilities and so as jason is saying if youre in an inflationary environment thats something you have to deal with because you need that expertise you need the people to develop the technology as well you need the people who service those clients and the price or cost of that is different and the same thing with developing the technological capabilities to be able to compete as well so hard to pick a number on that but as far as the dynamics that youre going through i think its a combination of what jason said there and then just whats happened in the competitive marketplace brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc right yeah i was thinking the growth would be closer to that level of to rather than the historical given everything that youve been saying if that makes sense michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay okay great great thats pretty helpful thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp thanks brian operator and well then move on to our next question from gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi how are you jason jason you brought up a good point about the appreciation in the markets correlating with the feds balance sheet growing so dramatically in your slides you gave us that the total revenue for the full year the trust investment and other services fees were up i think you also showed us that the sp on a fourth quartertothe fourth quarter was up or thereabout how much of the growth would you attribute to the markets going higher versus your customers bringing in new business jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp you can get it pretty close on that northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah you want me to jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah go ahead sure mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp so gerard this is mark youre looking at the full year trust fee growth jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp correct mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp and so see if we can get there directionally for you because we did have obviously the significant waiver drag as well so waivers if you did the math i think were about a to 7point drag so that kind of brings you up to about a growth without the waivers and you know more than half of that was markets with the rest of it being organic but fairly close i mean call it or or so of that would have been from markets then theres other some other impacts like currencies and things like that but the markets that would give you good proxy for the markets gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no thats very helpful and then jason following up you mentioned a couple of times about you dont expect your loan growth in which was up i think in could be that strong can you maybe give us some color around where youre expecting to kind of pull it back or just not to be as aggressive in versus jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah its not a pullback its more we felt a couple of years ago our bankers felt indiscernible which was i think we were seen as a reluctant lender with our clients and our clients were doing things they took pride in having large assets for us to manage and advise but they didnt they thought we might not want to be a lender to them and we wanted to deliberately go back and explain to those clients that if they wanted to buy a third home if they were going to buy another business if they were involved in private equity and needed warehouse lines were there for them to do that and were excellent in doing the underwriting and were competitive on the pricing and we didnt want to go out and do new types of lending with new types of clients we wanted to do the same types of lending with the clients we knew and so weve gotten through a lot of that and we will so from here i think our lending opportunities will be more what does the market provide but that go back to those clients and explain to them how much we want to be supportive of them a lot of that has played through northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 and then the second dynamic and ive talked about it before is in this type of volatile environment some of our ultra ultrahigh net worth clients they will do very large loans and so thats driven some of the growth as well and its just unpredictable whether that will stay on the books for a long time gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and i know jason you dont want to give a forecast on loan growth but could it revert back to like pre2019 levels in terms of that kind of growth as we look forward thats indiscernible jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah i think that its less easy to predict i do think at this point weve the message is out that were there for our clients and so the answer is probably somewhere in between but the spiking is which could go up and could go down is just something that our portfolio sizewise isnt as granular on a percentage basis and so i just always try to remind people that as they are doing calculations quartertoquarter and yeartoyear gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great appreciate all the color thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah thanks gerard operator and with that that does conclude our questionandanswer session and i would like to turn it back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks michael g ogrady chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp thank you thanks for joining us and well talk to you in april for our first quarter earnings operator and with
