full year grew and our return on equity was fourth quarter results reflected trends that were consistent with those we saw through the first three quarters of the year namely on a yearoveryear basis weaker markets pressured our trust fees but this was more than offset by strong increases in net interest income northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 within our wealth management business assets under management and advisory fees grew sequentially in the fourth quarter total fees declined however due to the lagged effect of markets strategic price reductions in our index funds and shifts in client allocations out of liquidity products overall new business generation in wealth management was healthy in however we did see some deceleration in the second half of the year as market activity waned we continue to execute on our growth strategy in wealth management including increasing the size and effectiveness of our sales force expanding our digital marketing efforts and leveraging the differentiated capabilities of the northern trust institute in asset management assets under management were up sequentially but fees declined due to the outflows

president northern trust corp thank you mike and let me join jennifer and mike in welcoming you to our fourth quarter earnings call dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on page this morning we reported fourth quarter net income of million earnings per share were and our return on average common equity was our results were unfortunately impacted by the inclusion of million in pretax charges which reflect million in net income impact and in earnings per share impacts these charges included the following on a pretax basis million of investment security losses related to the intent to sell certain availableforsale debt securities which were subsequently sold in early january million of severancerelated charges million of occupancy charges related to early lease exits and million of pension settlement charges also recall that in the first quarter of this year we implemented an accounting reclassification of certain fees which continues to impact the yearoveryear comparisons as noted on this page lets move to page and review the financial highlights of the quarter including the charges previously mentioned yearoveryear revenue was down the expenses increased and net income was down in a sequential comparison revenue was down expenses were up while net income was down excluding the charges previously mentioned yearoveryear revenue was up and expenses increased excluding the charges previously mentioned on a sequential basis revenue was down and expenses were up lets look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page yearoveryear unfavorable currency translation reduced our revenue growth by approximately basis points trust investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled billion and were down from last year and down sequentially our trust fees continue to be unfavorably impacted by the weaker equity and fixed income markets and unfavorable currency movements as a reminder a significant portion of our trust fees are recorded on a month or quarter lag basis so this quarters performance is largely reflective of the third quarters market performance as well as the months of october and november the yearoveryear and sequential declines in all other remaining noninterest income are primarily driven by the million pretax investment security loss due to the intent to sell certain availableforsale debt securities these securities were subsequently sold in early january which ill describe in more detail in a few minutes net interest income on an fte basis which ill also discuss in more detail later was million and was up from a year ago and up sequentially lets look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page for our asset servicing business fees totaled million and were down yearoveryear and down sequentially within asset servicing custody and fund administration fees were million down yearoveryear but importantly they were flat sequentially custody and fund administration fees decreased from the prior year quarter primarily due to unfavorable markets and unfavorable currency translation partially offset by new business assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were trillion at quarter end down yearoveryear and up sequentially the yearoveryear decline was primarily driven by unfavorable markets and currency translation the sequential increase was primarily driven by favorable markets and currency translation northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 investment management fees within asset servicing were million up yearoveryear and down sequentially investment management fees decreased sequentially primarily due to asset outflows and unfavorable market investment management fees increased from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower money market fund fee waivers partially offset by asset outflows and unfavorable markets assets under management for asset servicing clients were billion down yearoveryear and up sequentially the yearoveryear decline was driven by asset outflows weaker equity in fixed income markets and unfavorable currency translation the sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and currency translation partially offset by asset outflows moving to our wealth management business trust investment and other servicing fees were million down compared to the prior year and down from the prior quarter within the regions the yearoveryear declines were primarily driven by unfavorable market impacts and asset outflows partially offset by the elimination of money market fund fee waivers sequentially the decline within the regions was primarily driven by unfavorable markets asset outflows and a strategic repricing initiative within global family office the yearoveryear growth was driven by lower fee waivers and new business partially offset by unfavorable markets the sequential decrease was mainly related to asset outflows unfavorable markets and the repricing initiative assets under management for our wealth management clients were billion at quarter end down year overyear and up on a sequential basis the yearoveryear decline was driven primarily by unfavorable markets and asset outflows the sequential increase was primarily due to favorable markets moving to page net interest income was million in the quarter and was up from the prior year earning assets averaged billion in the quarter down versus the prior year average deposits were billion and were down versus the prior year while loan balances averaged billion up compared to the prior year on a sequential quarter basis net interest income grew average earning assets were up average deposits declined while average loan balances were up the net interest margin was in the quarter up basis points from a year ago and up basis points from the prior quarter the prior year quarter increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates the sequential increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates partially offset by an unfavorable balance sheet mix turning to page on a yearoveryear basis expense growth benefited by approximately basis points due to currency translation as reported expenses were billion in the fourth quarter higher than the prior year and higher than the prior quarter the current quarters expenses included million in charges these charges in part reflect steps were taking in conjunction with the launch of our office of productivity to shift away we approach and manage our expenses through this initiative we expect to leverage data and analytics to help us better understand the efficacy of our spending so as to optimize our cost base and drive greater efficiencies throughout the organization well update you on our progress in the coming quarters as appropriate excluding charges in both periods expenses in the fourth quarter were up yearoveryear and up sequentially also recall that the current quarter includes the impact of the previously mentioned accounting reclassification which increased other operating expense by million compared to the prior year northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 compensation expense was up compared to the prior year and up sequentially the yearoveryear growth was primarily driven by higher salary expense in part due to inflationary pressures and the previously mentioned severancerelated charges partially offset by favorable currency translation the sequential increase is primarily to the aforementioned severance related charges and higher salary expense partially offset by lower incentives employee benefits expense was down compared to the prior quarter and down sequentially the year overyear decrease was primarily driven by lower ongoing pension expense partially offset by higher medical costs the sequential decrease was primarily due to lower pension costs including the lower pension settlement charge relative to the prior period partially offset by higher medical costs outside services expense was million and was up from a year ago and up sequentially the year overyear increase was primarily driven by higher technical service costs legal services and consulting services partially offset by lower third party advisory fees and subcustodian expense the sequential increase was primarily due to higher technical services costs and legal services partially offset by lower subcustodian expense and consulting costs equipment and software expense of million was up from a year ago and up sequentially the year overyear and sequential growth were both primarily driven by higher software costs due to continued investments in technology as well as inflationary pressures and higher amortization we also recognized a million termination charge associated with our mainframe strategy occupancy expense of million was up from a year ago and up sequentially the yearoveryear and sequential growth were both primarily driven by the previously mentioned million of charges related to early lease exits other operating expense of million was up from a year ago and up sequentially the yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by higher staffrelated expense business promotion and miscellaneous expense the sequential increase was primarily due to higher business promotion supplemental compensation plan expense and miscellaneous expenses in the current period turning to the full year our results in are summarized on page on the right margin of this page we outlined the charges that we called out for both years included these items net income was billion down compared to and earnings per share were down from the prior year in these charges had a million impact on net income and a impact on earnings per share in these charges had an million impact on net income and impact on earnings per share full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on page and include the charges previously mentioned trust investment and other servicing fees grew in the growth during the year was primarily driven by lower money market fee waivers and new business partially offset by unfavorable markets and unfavorable currency translation net interest income grew average earning assets during the year decreased by while the net interest margin increased basis points driven by higher average interest rates the net result was revenue growth of in compared to and expense growth of excluding these charges in both periods revenue for the full year was up from the prior year and expenses were up turning to page our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity tier ratio of under the standardized approach up from the prior quarters our tier leverage ratio was up from in the prior quarter a decrease in net unrealized losses in the availableforsale securities portfolio and less foreign northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 exchange volatility were the primary factors in this quarters increase in capital ratios accumulated other comprehensive income at the end of the quarter was a loss of billion during the quarter we returned million to common shareholders through cash dividends of million and share repurchases of million in early january of this year we sold billion of higher capital consuming loweryielding nonhqla debt securities and reinvested the proceeds into lower capitalconsuming higheryielding hqla assets this repositioning offered a unique opportunity to derisk our portfolio free up capital and improve our liquidity ratios while simultaneously generating more attractive returns with that marjorie please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you very much operator instructions well pause for a moment to allow the opportunity to signal for questions but while we do well take our first question from glenn schorr from evercore please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi good morning so i guess ill try to focus on deposits so the interestbearing down the noninterest bearing down yearonyear but theres a clear declining impact on a sequential basis so im curious a much higher rate paid and a slow and a decelerating outflow of deposits how do we can you help us think through what to expect in on both attrition mix and betas for deposits thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure well let me theres a lot going on with the balance sheet with the repositioning as well so let me give you a couple of the key ingredients and then let me know if theres additional detail youd like so just on volume we saw volume up at down last to billion we still think that that billion to billion is a good starting point for first quarter and as you know the quarters have some seasonality we usually get a spike at the end of fourth quarter first quarter gets some build from tax preparation and in the second quarter well start to see outflows as clients pay taxes but as you think about first quarter at least billion to billion still a good range then let me take beta in three different and or rate really in three different parts first beta and you noted that beta was high wed indicated we thought it would be at this point in the cycle and we still think that thats a pretty good indication of what it will look like over the course of the next three months so beta for interestbearing deposits was it was in line we do anticipate that to be similar balance sheet repositioning that takes billion a little bit more at what was about or then reinvest it on the short end of the curve a couple hundred basis points higher right now were mostly overnight but well northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 continue to think about what we want to do with that from a nonhqla perspective but at least the starting point you should be thinking about is moving that billion to overnight and then just lastly as were talking about rate just a quick reminder the oneoff on the portfolio is just over billion and youre moving that from to higher rates were repositioning as we mature securities to the short end so theres a similar pickup there and then last thing on outlook just as you think about first quarter is just remember that day count costs us about million going from fourth quarter to first quarter so those were the big ingredients hopefully thats helpful glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi wow thats well prepared thank you appreciate it and maybe just followup is similar question on average earning assets up quarteronquarter should we feel in the range of stable now or i guess jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah its hard to tell i mean i think about it very much from where obviously as you know its a liability driven balance sheet and so the commentary on deposits is really whats driving the size of average earning assets in general and what we saw in the quarter it certainly does look like things have that like client behavior has settled and leveled out a little bit but were not calling it flat at this point were still operating in a way that were anticipating some muted but continued decline thats why that billion to billion thats really the you should think of that as the driver of average earning assets glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay i appreciate all that thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator thank you and well take our next question from betsy graseck from morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 so i heard all the commentary around the expenses and the efforts to kind of slow the growth rate as we go forward here but maybe you could help us understand maybe the pace at which you think you can do that because when i strip out the onetimers from the expense ratio it still looks like the expense ratio moved up a bit around basis points qonq so how should i think about the trajectory from here does it stabilize where it is is there still some pushup from here or should we expect that the arc begins to come down in how should we think through that jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp well its not it doesnt stay where it is and it certainly doesnt doesnt increase over time that expense ratio needs to come down its pretty good youre talking about assumed expense to trust fee betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp and so a few yeah a few things to think about one and we can get into more detail on it but in the short run at least from an expense perspective as we think about what first quarter is going to look like i can give you some thoughts there just as you start to model out what does it look like compensation is obviously our biggest line and so weve got to start there and so weve got the million which you indicated even pulling that out and so what does that look like going forward we actually think that in general that line item should start to flatten out in the near term as some of those severancerelated activities come online and we should get a benefit from that to your question on timing we should get a benefit on it this year were not going to get a benefit of it right away but a significant portion more than half of the actions were going to take with severance were anticipating to take place first in the by the end of the first quarter so were going to start to see benefit of that were going to backfill some of those roles but theyre not going to be in expensive locations this is less about us addressing fte or head count and its getting at what the economics are which is the salary run rate line for the business showing up in comp and were going to get a benefit of that this year and so as you think about first quarter dont forget that weve also got retirementeligible incentives coming online that hits million in that quarter but thats very predictable and seasonal the other dynamics for compensation id call it a wash as we think about going into the first quarter and then equipment and software is where weve seen a big uplift over the last couple of years and weve talked a few weeks ago externally about the fact that we thought that line would be at about million it came in higher than that at million but that difference of that is the million is a contract termination we decided to do very late in the quarter otherwise we feel like that line item is starting to flatten out as well we will have a stepup as we come into first quarter but we think beyond that that line item is going to flatten out thats obviously where all of our depreciation is but were going to see an uplift of about million in first quarter in equipment and software of that coming from depreciation and amortization but other than that were anticipating that line item to start to flatten out were not going to see this kind of growth going forward and northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 then the other side of it is as we think about trust fees and growth in the business thats going to help the ratio that you started with as well mike i dont know if you want to talk just more strategically about how youre thinking about this michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah i would just add betsy to your point it is about trajectories and curves if you will so weve been on a downward trajectory with trust fees as a result of the factors that jason has gone through obviously were trying to drive that the other way primarily through growth when it comes to nii weve had a strong trajectory up thats not likely to carry through into the new year or into just as a result of the rate cycle and then looking at the expenses as jason went through there were clearly trying to bend down that expense growth curve without a doubt through the productivity office but also just in every day in how we operate the business betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and that curve bend downwards sounds like its a second half like well see that more in second half than in first michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah i think thats right because as jason is saying some of these things theres actions that we already took in the fourth quarter which we had talked about on the previous call the intent to get going on those and then more of them that are happening in the first quarter as well and then carrying through so youre right by the time you see the impact its delayed relative to the action betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you appreciate it jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator and our next question comes from brennan hawken from ubs please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc excuse me good morning hope you guys are doing well hoping to get some more specifics here so the productivity office helpful that were seeing that emerge but like what are the objectives right so what are the northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 metrics that theyre looking to drive you gave some generally kind of high level comments on how to think about bending the curve and whatnot there in response to betsys question but really expenses have been a bit out of control just being blunt especially relative to the peer group and especially relative to the revenue trends so investors are really im getting hit a lot this morning looking for some more details better understanding and what specific metrics youre using and how we can make sure too that youre hitting your goals when youre pushing through to make these changes jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah i can first of all the thing that we look at to litmus test how were doing from an expense management perspective is still expense to trust fees and even pulling out the charges from this quarter being anywhere near thats not where the business is going to be in the long run thats going to come down and so then you start to think more tactically how does the productivity office look to do that just to say what are the numbers associated with it historically weve talked about productivity matching inflation and when inflation was at or we felt like we were doing that really well and with inflation at or we are not going to get productivity to that level but we should absolutely have productivity above of our expense base second every group in this company has productivity goals we go through it all the time every year in our planning process and then next if you start to just think tactically how is this office going to get this work where are the buckets that were going to get at ill give you how the group is laid out first of all its technology thats the largest component of our and the fastestgrowing expense item we have thats billion and so we have to weve got to get at technology costs we accomplished a lot in and but weve got to do it efficiently and that means determining how were purchasing how were developing technology how were consuming it how were delivering it two is vendor strategy and how were thinking about engaging with our partners externally three investment governance there are areas around the company where were investing in growth for the business were investing to get deeper and stronger but weve got to accomplish those things but at the same time test whether or not we still want to be investing at the same rate at the same timing and then lastly fourth is a big pillar is workforce analysis and a couple things there thats you already see us getting at larger severance than we normally take and that should get to or positions that will be impacted thats why were focused on driving productivity across operations and then even separately than this we took out hundreds of technologyrelated contractors in fourth quarter and just as an indication of how aggressively were getting at this internally and thats a big effort to do that but again we accomplished a lot and now its time to turn the corner on it michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah and brennan i would just add i think jason described it well but think about it as a bottomsup and top down right which is each of the groups as jason say they have to have their productivity initiatives that work their way up to their productivity goals that are in the plan and then the topdown part is the productivity office which is doing things they can cut across the enterprise and also have the structure to work with the groups to help them meet those productivity initiatives so thats the approach to it and again this is we always have productivity as a part of the planning process but as jason is saying when you have inflation like we do you have to be able to ramp up those activities in order to get greater efficiencies northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc sure sure and everybodys dealing with inflation and its certainly troubling and its weighing on the results without question and that was a lot of color and i appreciate that color jason and mike i would encourage you please to provide some actual metrics though to the investment community so that we can measure your progress understand what your goals are and actually have some visibility in order to think about where youre going and what youre trying to do not just from a conceptual perspective but from a numbers perspective because i think that would really help in improving the confidence one followup question would be on wholesale funding i just took a look at wholesale funding was up again this quarter should we think about it getting back to the levels where it was like mid6 of the funding side of the balance sheet is that reasonable because it still looks like theres a little ways to go to get there or is this the upper end of the range and are you trying to limit that growth jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp theres not theres nothing strategic that weve been doing in that area to bring it down and so it is instructive as youre doing to look back at more historical levels its not to say thats the target but it is to say that where we are right now is not its not reflective of any strategy that we have for lower levels brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right thanks for the color jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator thank you very much well take our next question from alex blostein from goldman sachs please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp morning alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning thanks for the question so maybe pivot a little bit i was hoping to spend a couple minutes on the wealth management and the global family office trends you guys highlighted outflows client outflows asset outflows i think in both of those for the quarter wealth management tends to kind of ebb and flow but global family office historically i think has been a source of stronger organic growth so maybe help us unpack whats driving the outflows in both of these businesses and maybe also hit on the strategic price reductions that you mentioned how much of that is fully captured in the  results is there any kind of negative carryover effect into  as we think about fees and again maybe a little bit more color on the reasons behind these pricing reductions and what you ultimately expect to achieve there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so lets just walk the fees because thats probably would its kind of how youre framing the question and fees down roughly million for the quarter right at half of that is markets and then a quarter of it is the repricing that we mentioned earlier and as this group knows extraordinarily well in the asset management side of the business fee compression is still persistent and so weve not done those types of reductions a lot recently we want to make sure that were priced appropriately and so with some of the index products we took fee reductions thats only on the product side not on the advisory side and those were done theres a stepdown there no incremental benefit going forward and at this point no plans to do more the other quarter of the decline was outflows and that was but that was productrelated outflows so really client repositioning in the money market space in the liquidity space and weve seen a journey there for our clients across both wealth as well as asset servicing its very closely aligned to what we saw in deposits of large decline as we came into covid and decline as markets gained more confidence and then started to redeploy assets into risk assets and so if we think about the way we litmus test the business and wealth is to think about our advisory fee frankly not the product side but what are the assets and what are the fees related to the advice we have with clients and thats gone well in the quarter client flows for wealth management from an advisory perspective overall were positive on a linked quarter and yearoveryear basis the net new business and flow activity that we track was positive lowsingle digits but it was positive so the business is not in decline what were seeing is a lot of clients deploying away from their historical mix of using our money market funds and then in this quarter repricing of product alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it as you think about pricing broadly for the products not the advisory component but if you think about the money market offering given the fact that money market funds actually given a pretty healthy yield is there any thought around reducing your money market fees as well to become more competitive to maybe capture either more of those flows or prevent folks from leaving and seeking a better kind of yield options net of fees michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp we look at it all the time and it actually it comes its more that comes more into play on the institutional side and weve got a really weve got a very large and successful money market mutual fund business we do a lot of liquidity work for our clients and so even now there are some strategic waivers that we have in the institutional side of the business where were working pricing to ensure that were as attractive as we can be but its not just pricing that clients look at on the institutional side in particular they look at size and they look at the underlying quality of the assets and so a lot of the ultralarge investors have investment policy restrictions on how big they can be within a fund and so the fact that weve got funds that are billion billion billion it enables those large investors to put money to work and so the competition set is a little bit lower on the institutional side and were above that threshold so in the long run thats very good for us therell be ebbs and flows based on other factors in the long run its good northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 on the wealth side thats just going to ebb and flow with the business traditionally its been more aligned this is just a period of time where our clients are theyre also thinking about deploying to building their own treasury portfolios and laddering in portfolios there and then potentially other product theyll use ultrashort and so we do have high confidence that the mix of the usage of this product is going to come back to where it was historically and youre exactly right its a very attractive engagement for us economically alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay thanks ill hop back in the queue operator thank you well take our next question from ken usdin from jefferies jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning guys jason sorry to come back to nii but i was just wondering can you kind of put that all into context for us in terms of if the balance sheet shrinking you get a little bit of help from the repositioning just can nii grow from here or based on what you still expect on the rate curve and i guess that would be the question thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah yeah yeah no i appreciate you pushing on that the answer is yes it can absolutely grow from here and we anticipate that throughout the year it will and i dont think first quarter is going to see im not sure its going to see meaningful growth but the trajectories are still in our favor i mean the balance sheet repositioning in and of itself is thats an attractive lift and then betas are not and so with the fed actions were going to do well and then weve also got the runoff which helps us too and so that the only offset to that is volumes and thats what were not sure what thats going to look like but even that remained relatively flat why was it it was at the top end maybe a tiny bit above of what our anticipation was last quarter so if i look out through the year absolutely anticipation for nii to be to be growing from this million level ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you and my followup to that is how do you think about incremental betas from here in terms of deposit cost increases you had said youd expected a decent move up this quarter you did get that so how do we just understand that that mix of deposits and the beta that youre looking at thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure yeah i mean the mix i dont we havent seen that changing dramatically but youre raising an interesting point which is that the betas are actually different depending on the currency that youre talking about and so i northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 just think thats something thats important for people to think about and then most of the way the industry also calculates beta is on just the interestbearing portion i think its instructive to think about the total beta as well because as weve talked about the mix of interestbearing to noninterest bearing changes over time and so that has an effect as well but betas on the institutional side i think you got to call them close to at this point it varies by currency but i think you got to call it close to and then on the wealth management side its less than that its and you can imagine for us to get to a blended level that im talking about in kind of that to range wealth is closer to and the institutional side closer to ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you jason jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah operator thank you well take our next question from brian bedell from deutsche bank jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp morning brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning folks good morning jason thanks for taking my question maybe just to also ask about nii just but actually more to focus on that deposit growth trend and you talked about billion to billion in as you come into second quarter maybe its hard to assess this early but what type of headwind would tax payments be on that and then sort of a related question would be to what extent do you want to or do you think you need to defend the strategic wealth deposits and raise the beta further as we get into jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah were looking ill go in reverse order i mean weve talked about heavy defensive wealth deposits the economics are important and thats those are the things we want to be doing with our clients hard stop and so were going to do everything we can to defend those and theyre largely relationship driven but theres also there are pockets where our clients look really aggressively at rate and so weve got good governance and infrastructure to make sure were doing what we can to maximize that and then throughout the year youre just asking what are we how are we thinking about it over the course of the year weve tended you can go back and look historically at first quarter to second quarter and see what kind of decline there has been we dont think we dont anticipate anything different this year and then what i can tell you is that from there we dont expect we have more of a flattish outlook but weve got to just remember that that second quarter decline does take place and history should be a pretty good judge northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah thats helpful and then maybe just on expenses you mentioned the equipment and software up million in the first quarter is that from the million level in or is that million ex that charge jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah thanks for confirming that its off the million level brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great okay great thank you ill get back in the queue jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp thanks operator thank you and well take our next question from jim mitchell from seaport global please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning jim jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just a little bit on the pension accounting did that get triggered again this year and should we expect more charges this year jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp every year we come into and we dont expect there to be to trigger settlement accounting and its ironic because in we had the thresholds but then we did a larger rif and those ended up triggering and then this past year it was interest rates going up significantly that led to a higher level of retirements than we anticipated and so in no year do we anticipate it at this time but were in the exact the bad news is were in the exact same boat this time which is that we look at the thresholds with our outside actuaries with our consultants but we cant predict with high degrees of certainty what the experience will be from a retirement perspective and so we have to let that play through that said what weve experienced in and we had not experienced prior to that and so its not like this is something that its happened the last two years but if you look over the last years it hasnt happened and outside of these last two years and so thats how we think and it seems like more of a trend than what than certainly than what were planning or anticipating northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay and maybe just on capital you had nice sequential improvement in capital ratios is there any indiscernible you didnt really do much in the way of buybacks in do you see that being a bigger part of the eps story this year jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yes at some point and so if you about the framework weve used historically and ive talked about it a lot theres no red flags there and we dont have to have all of those components of the framework saying green if we look at it in combination at any given point in time and that were at right now we also still have billion in aoci thatll come down a little bit actually in a chunk because of the securities repositioning because we did that after the quarter and so weve got call it billion thats going to be accreting into capital over time the returns in the business are still strong and so its theres no reason we wouldnt be back at some point jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator thank you well take our next question from rob wildhack from autonomous research jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp morning rob robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research morning guys on the fee side i just wanted to check in on organic growth and the competitive landscape this quarter and into for both the institutional and the wealth businesses thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so different id say different stories there and on if we start with the we talked about wealth a little bit earlier and if we think about just the core underlying business really focusing more on the account management side then the business had a very strong first half of the year and the second half of the year was weaker and weve also noted gfo was much stronger than the regions but again thats going to ebb and flow over time but organic growth the way we have calculated and communicated it historically was negative in the regions for the quarter and call it flat for gfo northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 if you actually slightly positive for gfo if you think about it on a yearoveryear basis so it at least gives you a sense of where that business is and then on the but then again from the advisory side there even at the for the yearoveryear and at the end of the quarter the advisory fees did well and so the core business theyre strong just we think its the product mix and other factors leading to the way weve calculated organic growth is being negative in asset servicing different story we talked at the early part of the year that we felt pipeline was good that pipeline started to onboard in fourth quarter and we feel good about the growth in that business and the proxy there should be more custody and fund servicing fees just as i talked about account management fees in wealth management the proxy for the the same corollary there is custody and fund servicing and that was a positive in fourth quarter was actually really attractive we had new business that mike talked about early coming online in the business to the tune of kind of midsingle digits and we feel like that business is back to its historical organic growth rate and thats evidenced by what we onboarded the ph one knot onboarded business we have right now is higher than our threeyear average and the pipeline of business they have that theyre still bidding on in late stages is higher than the three year average for the business and so a lot of positive signs in the asset servicing business from an organic perspective robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research thats helpful just on that starting to onboard business in asset servicing i think in the past you had talked about that not really coming online until the second half of so is that a pull forward there jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp actually theres go ahead indiscernible a jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah actually that was it was early that we talked about there being business in the back half of the year those onboarding so that did come into place we do have right now theres a chunk of business that we know is onboarding in the short run the pipelines good and then you go out far there to the end of and theres another chunk of large business that were anticipating to come on in a couple different areas fourth quarter and even into first quarter of and so the pipeline for that business is at various stages is looking good robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research got it thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp welcome northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 operator thank you your next question comes from mike mayo from wells fargo securities please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi on the expenses its oh my i get it look you guys are dealing with the first decline in both stock and bond markets in over years you said youre preserving growth by investing in people and tech theres inflation but wow this is the worst quarterly operating leverage that i can recall for you guys and for the year it was negative operating leverage of basis points and even comp has grown twice the pace of revenue growth so i guess what im looking for is more assurance that expenses havent gotten away from you i get it at the high level you said it looks like youre rightsizing head count with severance you took out hundreds of tech related contracts you have some kind of mainframe strategy i have to tell you i just dont understand what that means from a bottom line standpoint so i guess the question is you said your expenses to trust fee ratio of is unacceptable but what is acceptable and when should you get there like or what kind of sense of urgency do you have because this is not the northern weve gotten to know over the past long while aside from your resiliency through tough times thanks michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp so mike its mike to your point if you go back a number of years where we were at levels that are like this its been a long time and thats why it is considered unacceptable where we are and we were effective in driving that ratio down into an area where yes we thought it was within that range for us to be able to continue to operate and thats kind of that to range and we have the same objective now of getting it back into that into that range that calculation is a numerator and a denominator and were trying to drive both of those right so beyond the challenging environment on the fee front which is going to happen at various times were trying to drive the organic growth there and as much as we had good growth in the year it was not one of our stronger organic growth levels so challenged on the numerator both i would say conditions but also what we did on our part and then on the other side i from an expense perspective i as jason said like we got a lot done not just this year but the last couple of years and really making ill call it the company more resilient and ill get into a little more detail on that but just contextually if you think back a few years with the pandemic and then the last couple of years the technology infrastructure of the company is just critical to your ability to be just what you said which is resilient and therefore your clients in any set of conditions and so thats required a lot of investments in technology some of it if you think about it you have to be able to operate completely remotely and so you have to invest to be able to do that and you also have to be reliable for clients and so when it comes to modernizing all the technology you have it does require investment on that front northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 and in the meantime we also push forward with our digitalization efforts which is much more the clientfacing part of that which is essential to being competitive and essential to growing so its been very active across that some of that is ill call it nondiscretionary right it needs to be done to be able to do what i said other parts of it you do have more discretion in the speed particularly around the digitalization front and youre looking at the returns that youre going to get for that so weve talked about things like matrix which has been a meaningful investment which will drive both productivity but also will drive our capabilities and therefore revenue and organic growth on that front the same thing is happening in wealth management where we have to make sure that our interface with our clients is frictionless as steve would say in the technology interface with the clients that part of it again we can pay some and thats part of what well have to do on the technology front and the last part of it is just the need for efficiencies around the technology spend and then just more broadly which weve done many times and need to just increase the focus on execution around those what ill call more traditional ways to drive productivity so you asked the question on okay when does it get into that range is it is it i dont know because i dont know exactly whats going to happen with the numerator and the denominator but thats what were driving towards is to get it into that range and in the meantime also trying to drive profitability meaning driving pretax margins above so thats kind of the view and the plan mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc can you give any specifics for the year i know its not always your style but in terms of kind of expense growth for the year or what the savings are from the elimination of all the tech contracts or even just if i think of investing along a j curve it seems like youre on this tech journey like a lot of others are and some are still in the investing phase and some are in the harvesting phase when do you think you go from investing to harvesting on this broader tech strategy which seems to be impacting your expenses michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah so ill answer both but then let jason add too but were clearly in the investing stage but i would say and youre always investing of course in that because the needs change over time et cetera but from a cresting perspective et cetera were more towards that than we are away from it if that makes sense and now that we have gotten a lot done in the last couple of years on that front so thats my view and then as far as the expenses weve talked about for the year expenses at so thats the part where were saying that doesnt work and so how do we bring that down now theres still going to be growth in expenses for the year because there are certain aspects that just carry into the year right so you do have base pay increases that flow in and you do have some of the technology costs that are amortization that just come into the year but outside of that youre trying to do everything you can with productivity to offset other increases mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you all right you said jason was going to follow up jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 well i can give you a little bit more color on the year if its helpful and whatever information is helpful obviously im happy to give what we see at this point but one thing as youre thinking about the next several quarters not just the next one is outside services was elevated and lots of things happening there in fourth quarter some of thats episodic some of that is has im sorry other expense some of thats episodic agency expense supplemental pension plan some of those have more of a longer term trend so think travel marketing that was actually up million over third quarter thats likely going to stay elevated but some of these are episodic and so we dont think were going to see other expenses at a million it should even that should quickly unless and some of its out of our control because things like the supplemental pension plan are market affected but that should get to below million and hopefully stay that way going forward and then you just think about the impact also of compensation just to give you some color there we know base pay is going to come online in second quarter thats going to be a million lift and then to severance activity we think that should thats going to help us help offset that a little bit probably million to million on a quarterly basis starting in the second third quarter and then well have some additional hiring but thats going to be in line with the growth of the business so that at least gives you a sense of some of the line items and then last visibility on equipment and software and the depreciation that we got coming into first quarter that levels out a lot theres some growth call it a couple million dollars a quarter after that but nowhere near this level and so a lot of that thats where you get to whats the impact of those hundreds of contracts coming out were starting to flatten that depreciation and amortization line which sits within equipment and software which has been the fastest grower it just reflected that weve gotten a lot of work done mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp you bet operator thank you well take our next question from gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi jason coming back to the expense topic in conversation on the salaries can you share with us the cost of those salaries is it going more to entrylevel folks or is it more your senior people and then second are you at risk of losing people which is why you had to bump up salaries and then maybe a little more details about just the salary portion northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah so two very different dynamics happening the actions were taking this year are not across the board much more targeted than they have been historically and very centered around frankly around technology and some operationsoriented functions effectively and so that just gives you a sense of where were going and then to why weve had some of the increases some of the salary increase we had last year obviously was an inflationrelated higherthanaverage merit increase but a lot of the growth we had last year was doing off cycle adjustments to retain talent specifically in the wealth management business and we think that thats largely done at this point we can never claim that thats with certainty that thats fully over but that was meaningful and we wanted you know how important that franchise is to us and how important that talent base is and so we were going to defend that base and with that episode that seems to be over at this point and were more to a businessasusual growth rate across the organization but were identifying areas where we can get significant salary run rate savings and getting after those aggressively gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup can you share with us on the sale of the fixed income portfolio which resulted in the losses that you reported can you give us some color on what types of securities were sold and the yields of those securities and then by reinvesting the proceeds from that sale how long will it take you to earn back that loss that you had to take to exit the portfolios jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah so what we looked for was were securities that have that had a combination of a couple things one poor rwa treatment and secondly lower coupon lower yield and third that they still had significant time to maturity and so that bucket ended up being billion billion the coupon on those was in the to on average and the reinvestment of those coming in at think about in earnings on reserve balances at the fed in the range at this point and in terms of the payback on that its more like a threeandahalf years but remember from a regulatory reporting perspective we had already stripped out the unrealized loss in that portfolio and so the drivers of this were very largely around the opportunity to improve capital ratios not that we needed to improve capital or liquidity we didnt but seeing the opportunity to benefit cet1 in the form of lower rwa treatment help improve liquidity ratio and at the same time not hurt the economic value of your earnings stream it was very attractive to go after and thats really what led us to do this gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator thank you well take our next question from steven chubak from wolfe research northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so gerard actually asked my question but i did want to clarify one item relating to the securities portfolio repositioning which is whether you have any appetite to actually engage in further repositioning of the book from here jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp well we would have appetite frankly because its an attractive thing to do but at the same time we feel like weve harvested just about everything thats there and im glad you asked the followup because as soon as i finished i realized gerard and now you might be interested in theres a little bit more color corporate bonds within the billion was about half munis and mortgagebacked securities were about a quarter each just so you know but its an attractive time to go after something like that given the yield curve and the ability to change non hqla assets to hqla assets pickup capital pickup liquidity and no impact from an economic perspective and in fact making it positive steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great thanks for taking my followup jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator thank you well next go to mike brown from kbw jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp morning mike michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great hey good morning i just want to follow up on one of the capital and share purchase question from earlier i guess i look at your capital ratios are well above your minimums which is consistent with how you youve always manage the capital but youve got a number of tailwinds on that front and jason you mentioned that you plan to resume the buybacks at some point but i guess it seems to me that theres really no time like the present so my question is should we expect the share repurchases to engage in a more meaningful way in the first quarter and when we think about the full year what are the guardrails we should consider for your capital ratios as we think about modeling capital return from here northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so we wont comment more on timing and if i get to the guardrails its instructive i think to look and again none of these are determinative theyre just part of how we think about it but these are the factors we think about look at the absolute levels which tells you to look at history look at where we are relative to peers and then relative to regulatory perspectives we look at those things and then the other dynamic is that rwa has been less predictable than precovid and we used our balance sheet to be there for our clients and we were one of the few institutions that actually let rwa increase over the last several years and its because we wanted our clients had loan demand and they wanted us to be there in fx activity and sec lending and we did that because we had it was because we were able to because we had the capital strength and flexibility to do that and so thats the thing that were also looking forward on to make sure that were not missing any significant changes in client demand that we that might impact our behavior but youre right in that sitting at is a much better position and then back to this concept of billion in aoci pulling to par over the next several years plus the return on equity in the business is still attractive and so were still each quarter accreting capital and so no reason we we wont be in the market at some point michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc if i could just follow up on that jason so the loan balances were down about sequentially it sounds like i guess how are you thinking about that loan demand from here our view is it sounded like it was kind of softer going forward but you kind of alluded to the fact that maybe you want to be there to meet client demand so are you expecting that loan demand to pick up here in and then i guess just one other followon on the capital side how do you think about inorganic actions here in terms of capital allocation like do you see any other opportunities to change your strategic asset mix and scale so that perhaps that could be another avenue that you would consider on the capital allocation front jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so on loan demand i always remind people super spiky and on the base of business we have and the clients that we have that can come with really significant asks and were happy to do it because a lot of times theyve got potentially billions of dollars in assets and then they might have a liquidity need and they dont want to liquidate the asset its a great opportunity for us to help them at very large dollar amounts it solidifies relationships well and so we just dont look quartertoquarter at loan volumes as much as i think its appropriate to for other institutions in general our growth expectations are for more of a businessasusual growth rate we do anticipate some growth this year in the business not a ton but more businessasusual and then on capital theres no problem were trying to fix and mix or scale and frankly in capability were just thinking opportunistically if things come up weve got the capital to be able to look at it we have talked about having more of a bias at this point toward wealth management weve done some things from an acquisition perspective in asset servicing over the last several years theyve gone well but weve got a whole product circle there that we feel good about were doing well but the more we can bring on attractive wealth clients that dont northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 necessarily have the holistic product approach that we can bring its a great opportunity for us to create value and so that would be thatd be top of the list but no problems were looking to solve from a mix or sale or scale perspective michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay very interesting thank you for taking my questions jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp you bet operator thank you well go to our last question from brian bedell from deutsche bank jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great great thanks for taking my followup switch gears a little bit just on the wealth side to what extent are you seeing any impact from some of your entrepreneur clients that they may have had lower valuations in their private businesses or in their public businesses are you seeing any kind of pullback from those clients is it significant or is it really just not that big a deal michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah brian its mike i would say we definitely are seeing a different perspective on the part of the clients that youre talking about or prospects right i mean a lot of the activity in beginning of was as a result of business owners who were selling their businesses were monetizing assets and so that was an uplift for us and with the reduced activity that youre seeing of ipos and market activity there but then also certainly in the private marketplace lower activity there definitely has had an impact for us of just less market opportunity for us brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah okay thanks and then just i had one more on expenses a lots been asked and answered but just in terms of the onboarding for the asset servicing pipeline should we expect what is typically in the business where you have some onboarding expenses ahead of when the contracts are installed and generating revenue is that something also that might create some noise for given the larger chunky mandate that i think youre bringing on jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah a couple things one nothing that wed call out at this point if that changes wed call it out for you and in some instances even some of those expenses are capitalized in longterm contracts but nothing at this point that we want you to be thinking ahead on northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great great thank you so much for taking my followups jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp you bet operator we will
