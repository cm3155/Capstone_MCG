item risk factors summary risk factors the company is subject to a number of risks that if realized could affect its business financial condition results of operations cash flows and access to liquidity materially as a financial services organization certain elements of risk are inherent in our businesses accordingly the company encounters risk as part of the normal course of its businesses some of the companys more significant challenges and risks include the following we are vulnerable to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets disruptions and volatility in financial markets can have a material adverse effect on our ability to access capital and liquidity on acceptable financial terms negative and fluctuating economic conditions such as a changing interest rate environment may cause our lending margins to decrease and reduce customer demand for our higher margin products and services we are subject to substantial regulation as a financial institution we are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies including limitations on permissible activities required financial stress tests required nonobjection to certain actions investigations and other regulatory proceedings if we are unable to meet the expectations of our regulators fully we may need to divert significant resources to remedial actions be unable to take planned capital actions andor be subject to fines or other enforcement actions among other things these circumstances could affect our revenues and expenses and other aspects of our business and operations adversely we may not be able to detect money laundering or other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis we work regularly to improve our policies procedures and capabilities to detect and prevent financial crimes however such crimes are evolving continually and there will be instances in which we may be used by other parties to engage in money laundering or other illegal or improper activities these instances may result in regulatory fines sanctions andor legal enforcement which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects credit risk is inherent in our business our customers and counterparties financial condition repayment abilities repayment intentions the value of their collateral and government economic policies market interest rates and other factors affect the quality of our loan portfolio many of these factors are beyond our control and there can be no assurance that our current or future loan and lease loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses liquidity and funding risks are inherent in our business changes in market interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously may be unpredictable and highly volatile and can significantly increase our cost of funding we rely primarily on deposits to fund lending activities however our ability to maintain or grow deposits depends on factors outside our control such as general economic conditions and confidence of depositors in the economy and the financial services industry if deposit withdrawals increase significantly in a short period of time it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates interest rates are highly sensitive to factors beyond our control such as increased regulation of the financial sector monetary policies economic and political conditions and other factors variations in interest rates could impact net interest income which comprises the majority of our revenue reducing our growth and potentially resulting in losses we are subject to significant competition we compete with banks that are larger than us and nontraditional providers of banking services who may not be subject to the same regulatory or legislative requirements to which we are subject if we are unable to compete successfully with current and new competitors and anticipate changing banking industry trends our business may be affected adversely pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic can affect our business pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic can affect our business closures disruptions to businesses and other actions that could restrict economic activity in the us due to pandemics or other public health emergencies may result in adverse effects on our customers and our business risks relating to data collection processing storage systems and data security proper functioning of financial controls accounting and other data collection and processing systems is critical to our businesses and our ability to compete effectively inadequate personnel inadequate or failed internal control processes or systems or external events that interrupt normal business operations could each impair our data collection processing storage systems and data security and result in losses we and others in our industry face cybersecurity risks we take protective measures and monitor and develop our systems continuously to protect our technology infrastructure and data from cyberattacks however cybersecurity risks continue to increase for our industry and the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of parties behind such attacks present risks for compromised data theft of funds or theft or destruction of corporate information and assets the financial results of our auto lending business could impact our results our auto lending business has historically been a significant source of earnings for the company factors that could negatively affect the auto lending businesss financial results could consequently affect shusas financial results the above list is not exhaustive and we face additional challenges and risks please carefully consider all of the information in this formk including matters set forth in this risk factors section risk factors risk management and mitigation are important parts of the companys business model and integrated into the companys daytoday operations the success of the companys business is dependent on managements ability to identify understand manage and mitigate the risks presented by business activities in light of the companys strategic and financial objectives these risks include credit risk market risk capital risk liquidity risk operational risk model risk investment risk compliance and legal risk and strategic and reputational risk we discuss our principal risk management processes in the risk management section included in item of this annual report on returns we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws if the judgments estimates and assumptions we use in preparing our tax returns are subsequently found to be incorrect there could be a material effect on our results of operations changes in taxes and other assessments may adversely affect us the legislatures and tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate regularly enact reforms to the tax and other assessment regimes to which we and our customers are subject such reforms include changes in the rate of assessments and occasionally enactment of temporary taxes the proceeds of which are earmarked for designated governmental purposes the effects of these changes and any other changes that result from enactment of additional tax reforms cannot be quantified and there can be no assurance that such reforms would not have an adverse effect upon our business aspects of recent us federal income tax reform such as the tax cuts and jobs act of limit or eliminate certain income tax deductions including the home mortgage interest deduction the deduction of interest on home equity loans and a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes these limitations and eliminations could affect demand for some of our retail banking products and the valuation of assets securing certain of our loans adversely increasing our credit loss expense and reducing profitability credit risks if the level of our npls increases or our credit quality deteriorates in the future or if our loan and lease loss reserves are insufficient to cover loan and lease losses this could have a material adverse effect on us risks arising from changes in credit quality and the recoverability of loans and amounts due from counterparties are inherent in a wide range of our businesses nonperforming or low credit quality loans have in the past negatively impacted and can continue to negatively impact our results of operations in particular the amount of our reported npls may increase in the future as a result of growth in our total loan portfolio including as a result of loan portfolios we may acquire in the future or factors beyond our control such as adverse changes in the credit quality of our borrowers and counterparties or a general deterioration in economic conditions in the united states the impact of political events events affecting certain industries or events affecting financial markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively control the level of the npls in our loan portfolio our loan and lease loss reserves are based on our current assessment of and expectations concerning various factors affecting the quality of our loan portfolio these factors include among other things our borrowers financial condition repayment abilities and repayment intentions the realizable value of any collateral the prospects for support from any guarantor government macroeconomic policies interest rates and the legal and regulatory environment our loan and lease loss reserves may also be influenced by other factors such as the degree that our loan portfolios are concentrated by loan type industry segment borrower type or location of the borrower or collateral such concentrations could increase the possibility that similarly situated borrowers and their collateral may collectively be affected by certain economic or market conditions or events such as for example natural or manmade disasters many of these factors are beyond our control as a result there is no precise method for predicting loan and credit losses and there can be no assurance that our current or future loan and lease loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses if our assessment of and expectations concerning the abovementioned factors differ from actual developments if the quality of our total loan portfolio deteriorates for any reason including an increase in lending to individuals and small and medium enterprises a volume increase in our credit card portfolio or the introduction of new products or if future actual losses exceed our estimates of expected losses we may be required to increase our loan and lease loss reserves which may adversely affect us if we were unable to control or reduce the level of our nonperforming or poor credit quality loans this also could have a material adverse effect on us in addition the fasbs topic financial instruments credit losses establishes a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost as a result of the adoption of this standard companies must recognize credit losses on these assets equal to managements estimate of credit losses over the assets remaining expected lives it is possible that our ongoing reported earnings and lending activity will be impacted negatively as a result of the application of this asu see changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings below our loan and investment portfolios are subject to risk of prepayment which could have a material adverse effect on us our fixedrate loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk which results from the ability of a borrower or issuer to pay a debt obligation prior to maturity generally in a low interest rate environment prepayment activity increases and this reduces the weighted average life of our earning assets and could have a material adverse effect on us we would also be required to amortize net premiums into income over a shorter period of time thereby reducing the corresponding asset yield and net interest income prepayment risk also has a significant adverse impact on credit card and collateralized mortgage loans since prepayments could shorten the weighted average life of these assets which may result in a mismatch in our funding obligations and reinvestment at lower yields prepayment risk is inherent in our commercial activity and an increase in prepayments could have a material adverse effect on us the value of the collateral securing our loans may not be sufficient and we may be unable to realize the full value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio the value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio may fluctuate or decline due to factors beyond our control including as a result of macroeconomic factors affecting the united states the value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio may be adversely affected by force majeure events such as natural disast ers including as a result of climate change partic ularly in locations in which a significant portion of our loan portfolio is composed of real estate loans natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods may cause widespread damage which could impair the asset quality of our loan portfolio and have an adverse impact on the economy of the affected region we also may not have sufficiently recent information on the value of collateral which may result in an inaccurate assessment of impairment losses of our loans secured by such collateral if any of the above were to occur we may need to make additional provisions to cover actual impairment losses on our loans which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and fi nancial condition in addition auto industry technology changes accelerated by environmental rules could affect our auto consumer business particularly the residual values of leased vehicles which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects we are subject to counterparty risk in our banking business we are exposed to counterparty risk in addition to credit risks associated with lending activities counterparty risk may arise from for example investing in securities of third parties entering into derivatives contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us or executing securities futures currency or commodity trades that fail to settle at the required time due to nondelivery by the counterparty or systems failure by clearing agents clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries we routinely transact with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual funds hedge funds and other institutional clients we rely on information provided by or on behalf of counterparties such as financial statements and we may rely on representations of our counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information defaults by and even rumors or questions about the solvency of certain financial institutions and the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by other institutions many routine transactions we enter into expose us to significant credit risk in the event of default by one of our significant counterparties liquidity and financing risks liquidity and funding risks are inherent in our business and could have a material adverse effect on us liquidity risk is the risk that we either do not have sufficient financial resources available to meet our obligations as they become due or we can secure them only at excessive cost this risk is inherent in any banking business and can be heightened by a number of enterprisespecific factors including overreliance on a particular source of funding changes in credit ratings or marketwide phenomena such as market dislocation while we implement liquidity management processes to mitigate and control these risks unforeseen systemic market factors in particular make it difficult to eliminate these risks completely adverse and continued constraints in the supply of liquidity including interbank lending may materially and adversely affect the cost of funding our business and extreme liquidity constraints may affect our current operations and our ability to fulfill regulatory liquidity requirements as well as limit growth possibilities our cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing market interest rates and our credit spreads increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can significantly increase the cost of our funding changes in our credit spreads are marketdriven and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile if wholesale markets financing ceases to be available or becomes excessively expensive we may be forced to raise the rates we pay on deposits with a view to attracting more customers andor to sell assets potentially at depressed prices the persistence or worsening of these adverse market conditions or an increase in base interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our ability to access liquidity and cost of funding we rely and will continue to rely primarily on deposits to fund lending activities the ongoing availability of this type of funding is sensitive to a variety of factors outside our control such as general economic conditions and the confidence of depositors in the economy in general and the financial services industry in particular as well as competition among banks for deposits any of these factors could significantly increase the amount of deposit withdrawals in a short period of time thereby reducing our ability to access deposit funding in the future on appropriate terms or at all if these circumstances were to arise they could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects we anticipate that our customers will continue to make deposits particularly demand deposits and shortterm time deposits in the near future and we intend to maintain our emphasis on the use of banking deposits as a source of funds the shortterm nature of some deposits could cause liquidity problems for us in the future if deposits are not made in the volumes we expect or are not renewed if a substantial number of our depositors withdraw their demand deposits or do not roll over their time deposits upon maturity we may be materially and adversely affected there can be no assurance that in the event of a sudden or unexpected shortage of funds in the banking system we will be able to maintain levels of funding without incurring high funding costs a reduction in the term of funding instruments or the liquidation of certain assets if this were to happen we could be materially adversely affected credit market and liquidity risk may have an adverse effect on our credit ratings and our cost of funds any downgrading in our credit rating would likely increase our cost of funding require us to post additional collateral or take other actions under some of our derivative contracts and adversely affect our interest margins and results of operations credit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally any downgrade in our or santanders debt credit ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs and require us to post additional collateral or take other actions under some of our derivatives contracts and could limit our access to capital markets and adversely affect our commercial business for example a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market certain of our products engage in certain longerterm and derivatives transactions and retain customers particularly customers who need a minimum rating threshold in order to invest in addition under the terms of certain of our derivatives con tracts we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or terminate the contracts any of these results of a ratings downgrade in turn could reduce our liquidity and have an adverse effect on us including our operating results and financial condition we conduct a significant number of our material derivatives activities through santander and santander uk we estimate that as of december if all of the rating agencies were to downgrade santanders or santander uks longterm senior debt ratings we would be required to post additional collateral pursuant to derivatives and other financial contracts refer to further discussion in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements while certain potential impacts of these downgrades are contractual and quantifiabl e the full consequences of a credit rating downgrade are inherently uncertain as they depend on numerous dynamic complex and interrelated factors and assumptions including market conditions at the time of any downgrade whether any downgrade of a companys longterm credit rating precipitates downgrades to its shortterm credit rating and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers investors and counterparties actual outflows could be higher or lower than this hypothetical example depending on certain factors including which credit rating agency downgrades our credit rating any management or restructuring actions that could be taken to reduce cash outflows and the potential liquidity impact from loss of unsecured funding such as from money market funds or loss of secured funding capacity although unsecured and secured funding stresses are included in our stress testing scenarios and a portion of our total liquid assets is held against these risks it is still the case that a credit rating downgrade could have a material adverse effect on the company sbna and sc in addition if we were required to cancel our derivatives contracts with certain counterparties and were unable to replace those contracts our market risk profile could be altered there can be no assurance that the rating agencies will maintain their current ratings or outlooks in general the future evolution of our ratings will be linked to a large extent to the macroeconomic outlook and to the impact of significant events on our asset quality profitability and capital failure to maintain favorable ratings and outlooks could increase the cost of funding and adversely affect net interest margins which could have a material adverse effect on us market risks we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and other market risks which may materially and adversely affect us market risk refers to the probability of variations in our net interest income or in the market value of our assets and liabilities due to volatility of interest rates exchange rates or equity prices economic activities exposed to market risk include i transactions where risk is assumed as a consequence of potential changes in interest rates inflation rates exchange rates stock prices credit spreads commodity prices volatility and other market factors ii the liquidity risk from our products and markets and iii the balance sheet liquidity risk market risk affects i our interest income charges ii the market value of our assets and liabilities in particular of our securities holdings loans and deposits and derivatives transactions and iii other areas of our business such as the volume of loans originated or credit spreads interest rates are highly sensitive to m any factors beyond our control including increased regulation of the financial sector monetary policies domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors variations in interest rates could affect our net interest income which comprises the majority of our revenue reducing our growth rate and potentially resulting in losses this is a result of the different effect a change in interest rates may have on the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on our borrowings in addition we may incur costs which in turn will impact our results as we implement strategies to reduce future interest rate exposure increases in interest rates may reduce the volume of loans we originate sustained high interest rates have historically discouraged customers from borrowing and have resulted in increased delinquencies in outstanding loans and deterioration in the quality of assets increases in interest rates may also reduce the propensity of our customers to prepay or refinance fixedrate loans increases in interest rates may reduce the value of our financial assets and the collateral used to secure our loans and may reduce gains or require us to record losses on sales of our loans or securities in addition we may experience increased delinquencies in a low interest rate environment when such an environment is accompanied by high unemployment and recessionary conditions some of our investment management services fees are based on financial market valuations of assets certain of our subsidiaries manage or hold in custody for clients changes in these valuations can affect noninterest income positively or negatively and ultimately affect our financial results significant changes in the volume of activity in the capital markets and in the number of assignments we are awarded could also affect our financial results to the extent any of these risks materialize our net interest income and the market value of our assets and liabilities could be materially adversely affected recent government fiscal and monetary policies and other factors have led to increased inflation in the us and globally governmental and regulatory authorities throughout the world implemented fiscal and monetary policies and initiatives to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on the economy and individual businesses and households these fiscal and monetary policy measures accelerated the economic recovery in but in turn significantly increased public debt and introduced risks of economic overheating in certain countries in inflationary pressures intensified due to a number of factors including the revitalization of demand for consumer goods labor shortages supply chain issues and the rise in the prices of energy oil gas and other commodities exacerbated by the war in ukraine in an effort to contain inflation central banks increased interest rates during and contributing to a slowdown of the global economy many countries experienced persistent high inflation and even though inflation has begun to fall in most markets central banks are expected to sustain high interest rates to address persistent underlying inflation pressures through mid2024 prolonged periods of high inflation are likely to result in higher operating costs a decrease in the purchasing power of families with a consequent increase in delinquencies in our credit portfolios and lower economic growth derived from the tightening of monetary and fiscal policies aimed at containing inflation among other risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and prospects market conditions have resulted and could result in material changes to the estimated fair values of our financial assets negative fair value adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in recent years financial markets have been subject to volatility and the resulting widening of credit spreads we have material exposures to securities and other investments that are recorded at fair value and are therefore exposed to potential negative fair value adjustments asset valuations in future periods reflecting thenprevailing market conditions may result in negative changes in the fair values of our financial assets and also may translate into increased impairments in addition the value we ultimately realize on disposal of the asset may be lower than its current fair value any of these factors could require us to record negative fair value adjustments which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition to the extent fair values are determined using financial valuation models such values may be inaccurate or subject to change as the data used by such models may not be available or may become unavailable due to changes in market conditions particularly for illiquid assets and in times of economic instability in such circumstances our valuation methodologies require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates in order to establish fair value and reliable assumptions are difficult to make and are inherently uncertain in addition valuation models are complex making them inherently imperfect predictors of actual results any resulting impairments or writedowns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects we are subject to market operational and other related risks associated with our derivatives transactions that could have a material adverse effect on us we enter into derivatives transactions for trading purposes as well as for hedging purposes we are subject to market credit and operational risks associated with these transactions including basis risk the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding andor hedge cost and credit or default risk the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder including providing sufficient collateral the execution and performance of derivatives transactions depend on our ability to maintain adequate control and administration systems and to hire and retain qualified personnel moreover our ability to adequately monitor analyze and report derivatives transactions continues to depend to a great extent on our it systems these factors further increase the risks associated with these transactions and could have a material adverse effect on us in addition disputes with counterparties may arise regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivatives contracts including with respect to the value of underlying collateral which could cause us to incur unexpected costs including transaction operational legal and litigation costs or result in credit losses all of which may impair our ability to manage our risk exposure from these products risk management failure to successfully implement and continue to improve our risk management policies procedures and methods including our credit risk management system could materially and adversely affect us and we may be exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks risk management is an integral part of our activities we seek to monitor and manage our risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial credit market operational compliance and legal reporting systems we must also maintain a culture of risk management among our employees although we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques such techniques and strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all economic market environments or against all types of risk including risks that we fail to identify or anticipate some of our tools and metrics for managing risk are based on our use of observed historical market behavior we apply statistical and other tools to these observations to arrive at quantifications of our risk exposures these tools and metrics may fail to predict future risk exposures these risk exposures could for example arise from factors we did not anticipate or correctly evaluate in our statistical models this would limit our ability to manage our risks our losses therefore could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate in addition our statistical models do not take all risks into account our approach to managing risks could prove insufficient exposing us to material unanticipated losses we could face adverse consequences as a result of decisions based on models that are poorly developed implemented or used or as a result of a modeled outcome being misunderstood or used of for purposes for which it was not designed in addition if existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate they could take their business elsewhere or seek to limit transactions with us this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation operating results financial condition and prospects as a commercial bank one of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk for example an important feature of our credit risk management is to employ an internal credit rating to assess the particular risk profile of a customer since this process involves detailed analyses of the customer taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors it is subject to human and it systems errors in exercising their judgment on the current and future credit risk of our customers our employees may not always assign an accurate credit rating which may result in a higher exposure to credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system we have been refining our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers however we may not be able to timely detect all possible risks before they occur or due to limited tools available to us our employees may not be able to implement them effectively which may increase our credit risk failure to effectively implement consistently follow or continuously refine our credit risk management system may result in an increase in the level of npls and a higher risk exposure for us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations model risk we rely on models for many of our decisions their inaccurate or incorrect use could have a material adverse effect on us we use models for approval scoringrating capital calculation behavior provisions market operational risk compliance and liquidity a model is a system approach or quantitative method that applies statistical economic financial or mathematical theories techniques or hypotheses to transform input data into quantitative estimates it involves simplified representations of realworld relationships between characteristics values and observed assumptions that allows us to focus on specific aspects model risk is the negative consequence of decisions based on their inaccurate improper or incorrect use sources of model risk include incorrect or incomplete data in the model itself or the modelling method used in systems and 2ii incorrect use or implementation of the model model risk can cause financial loss erroneous commercial and strategic decisionmaking and or damage to our transactions in addition the fair value of our financial assets determined using financial valuation models may be inaccurate or subject to change and as a consequence we may have to register impairments or writedowns that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects market conditions have resulted and could result in material changes to the estimated fair values of our financial assets negative fair value adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects bu siness and industry risks the financial problems our customers face could adversely affect us market turmoil and economic recession could materially and adversely affect the liquidity businesses andor financial condition of our borrowers which could in turn increase our npl ratios impair our loan and other financial assets and result in decreased demand for borrowings in general any of the conditions described above could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations increased competition and industry consolidation may adversely affect our results of operations we face substantial competition in all parts of our business from numerous banks and nonbank providers of financial services including in originating loans and attracting deposits providing customer service the quality and range of products and services technology interest rates and overall reputation and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify our competition comes principally from other domestic and foreign banks mortgage banking companies consumer finance companies insurance companies and other lenders and purchasers of loans there has been a trend towards consolidation in the banking industry which has created larger banks with which we must now compete some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are which may give those competitors advantages such as a more diversified product and customer base the ability to reach more customers and potential customers operational efficiencies lowercost funding and larger branch networks many competitors are also focused on crossselling their products which could affect our ability to maintain or grow existing customer relationships or require us to offer lower interest rates or fees on our lending products or higher interest rates on deposits there can be no assurance that increased competition will not adversely affect our growth prospects and therefore our operations we also face competition from nonbank competitors such as brokerage companies department stores for some credit products leasing and factoring companies mutual fund and pension fund management companies and insurance companies nontraditional providers of banking services such as financial technology companies internet based ecommerce providers mobile telephone companies and internet search engines may offer andor increase their offerings of financial products and services directly to customers these nontraditional providers of banking services currently have an advantage over traditional providers because they are not subject to the same regulatory or legislative requirements to which we are subject several of these competitors may have long operating histories large customer bases strong brand recognition and significant financial marketing and other resources they may adopt more aggressive pricing and rates and devote more resources to technology infrastructure and marketing new competitors may enter the market or existing competitors may adjust their services with unique product or service offerings or approaches to providing banking services if we are unable to compete successfully with current and new competitors or if we are unable to anticipate and adapt our offerings to changing banking industry trends including technological changes our business may be adversely affected in addition our failure to anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in customer behavior effectively including among younger customers could delay or prevent our access to new digitalbased markets which would in turn have an adverse effect on our competitive position and business furthermore the widespread adoption of new technologies including distributed ledger artificial intelligence andor biometrics to provide services such as cryptocurrencies and payments could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we continue to grow our internet and mobile banking capabilities our customers may choose to conduct business or offer products in areas that may be considered speculative or risky such new technologies and the rise in customer use of internet and mobile banking platforms in recent years could negatively impact the value of our investments in bank premises equipment and personnel for our branch network the persistence or acceleration of this shift in demand towards internet and mobile banking may necessitate changes to our retail distribution strategy which may include closing andor selling certain branches and restructuring our remaining branches and workforce these actions could lead to losses on these assets and increased expenditures to renovate reconfigure or close a number of our remaining branches or otherwise reform our retail distribution channel furthermore our failure to keep pace with innovation or to swiftly and effectively implement such changes to our distribution strategy could have an adverse effect on our competitive position increasing competition could also require that we increase the rates we offer on deposits or lower the rates we charge on loans which could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations it may also negatively affect our business results and prospects by among other things limiting our ability to increase our customer base and expand our operations and increasing competition for investment opportunities if our customer service levels were perceived by the market to be materially below those of our competitors we could lose existing and potential business if we are not successful in retaining and strengthening customer relationships we may lose market share incur losses on some or all of our activities or fail to attract new deposits or retain existing deposits which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations inability to manage the growth of our operations or to integrate our inorganic growth successfully could adversely impact profitability we allocate management and planning resources to develop strategic plans for organic growth and to identify possible acquisitions and disposals and areas for restructuring our businesses from time to time we evaluate acquisition and partnership opportunities that we believe offer additional value to our shareholders and are consistent with our business strategy however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or partnership candidates and our ability to benefit from any such acquisitions or partnerships depend in part on our successful integration of those businesses any such integration entails significant risks such as unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems unexpected liabilities or contingencies relating to the acquired businesses and delivery and execution risks we can give no assurances that our expectations with regards to integration and synergies of these businesses will materialize we also cannot provide assurance that we will in all cases be able to manage our growth effectively or deliver our strategic growth objectives challenges that may result from our strategic growth decisions include our ability to manage the operations and employees of expanding businesses efficiently maintain or grow our existing customer base assess the value strengths and weaknesses of investment or acquisition candidates including local regulation that can reduce or eliminate expected synergies finance strategic investments or acquisitions align our current it systems adequately with those of an enlarged group apply our risk management policies effectively to an enlarged group and manage a growing number of entities without overcommitting management or losing key personnel any failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations good will impairments may be required in relation to acquired businesses we have made business acquisitions for which it is possible that the goodwill which has been attributed to those businesses may have to be written down if our valuation assumptions are required to be reassessed as a result of any deterioration in the business underlying profitability asset quality interest rate environment or other relevant matters impairment testing with respect to goodwill is performed annually more frequently if impairment indicators are present and includes a comparison of the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than the fair value the impairment is measured as this excess of carrying value over fair value we did not recognize any impairments of goodwill in or however based on future market conditions and the companys financial performance it is possible we may be required to record additional impairment of goodwill of up to billion attributable to one or more of the companys reporting units in the future there can be no assurance that we will not have to write down the value attributed to goodwill further in the future which would not impact riskbased capital ratios adversely but would adversely affect our results of operations and stockholders equity see note to our consolidated financial statements goodwill and other intangibles for a discussion of the risk of potential future impairment of our cre reporting unit we rely on recruiting retaining and developing appropriate senior management and skilled personnel our continued success depends in part on the continued service of key members of our management team the ability to continue to attract train motivate and retain highly qualified professionals is a key element of our strategy the successful implementation of our growth strategy depends on the availability of skilled management and employees both at our head office and at each of our business unit s changes to the labor market as a result of the covid19 pandemic such as increased employee attrition labor availability and increased wages may make it more challenging to attract and retain talented personnel if we or one of our business units or other functions fails to staff its operations appropriately or loses one or more of its key senior executives and fails to replace them in a satisfactory and timely manner our business financial condition and results of operations including control and operational risks may be adversely affected the financial industry in the united states has experienced and may continue to experience more stringent regulation of employee compensation which could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified employees in addition due to our relationship with santander we are subject to indirect regulation by the european central bank which has recently imposed compensation restrictions that may apply to certain of our executive officers and other employees under the crd iv prudential rules these restrictions may impact our ability to retain our experienced management team and key employees and our ability to attract appropriately qualified personnel which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations damage to our reputation could cause harm to our business prospects maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers investors and employees and conducting business transactions with our counterparties damage to our reputation could materially and adversely affect our perception among current and potential clients investors vendors partners regulators and other third parties which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects as well as damage our customers and investors confidence harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct litigation or regulatory outcomes failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality dealing with sectors that are not well perceived by the public eg weapons industries dealing with customers on sanctions lists ratings downgrades compliance failures unethical behavior press speculation perception of our environmental social and governmental practices and disclosures and the activities of customers and counterparties including activities that affect the environment negatively further adverse publicity regulatory actions or fines litigation operational failures or the failure to meet client expectations or other obligations could materially and adversely affect our reputation our ability to attract and retain clients or our sources of funding for the same or other businesses our reputation could also suffer if we are the subject of negative coverage in the media whether it has merit or not actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect our reputation since we are part of the global santander group and conduct business under the santander brand negative public opinion about the actions or activities of other santander businesses around the world could affect our reputation adversely additionally the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis and increased regulatory supervision and enforcement have caused public perception of us and others in the financial services industry to decline activists increasingly target financial services firms with criticism for relationships with clients engaged in businesses whose products are perceived to be harmful to the health of customers or whose activities are perceived to affect public safety the environment climate or workers rights negatively even when such businesses are legal such criticism could take many forms including protests at our locations and could increase dissatisfaction among customers investors and employees of the company and damage the companys reputation alternatively yielding to such activism could damage the companys reputation with groups whose views are not aligned with those of the activists in either case certain clients and customers may cease to do business with the company and the companys ability to attract new clients and customers may be diminished activist pressure can also be a factor when we consider pursuing new business opportunities potentially resulting in our not pursuing otherwise profitable opportunities additionally we could suffer significant reputational harm that could affect our business results of operations and prospects from any negative perceptions regarding topics related to environmental social and corporate governance policies there has been increased focus by customers shareholders investor advocacy groups employees regulators and other stakeholders on these topics and our policies practices and disclosures in these areas could come under scrutiny governments may implement new or additional regulations and standards or investors customers and other stakeholders may impose new expectations or focus investments in ways that cause significant shifts in disclosure consumption and behaviors that may have negative impacts on our business if regulators or stakeholders consider our efforts to be ineffective inadequate or unsatisfactory whether real or perceived it could harm our reputation business and prospects and we could be subject to enforcement other supervisory actions or other harm prese rving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems procedures and controls that address known risks and regulatory requirements as well as our ability to timely identify understand and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate the regulatory environment and customer expectations we could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest properly the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions against us therefore there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us while negative public opinion once was primarily a response to adverse coverage in traditional news media increased use of social media platforms has resulted in rapid dissemination of information and misinformation which can magnify potential harm to the companys reputation we may be the subject of misinformation and misrepresentations propagated deliberately to harm our reputation or for other deceitful purposes including by others seeking to gain an illegal market advantage by spreading false information about us there can be no assurance that we will be able to neutralize or contain false information that may be propagated regarding the company which could have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects fraudulent activity associated with our products or networks could cause us to suffer reputational damage the use of our products to decrease and our fraud losses to be materially adversely affected we are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants customers and other third parties handling customer information the risk of fraud continues to increase for the financial services industry in general credit and debit card fraud identity theft and related crimes are prevalent and perpetrators are growing more sophisticated our resources customer authentication methods and fraud prevention tools may not be sufficient to accurately predict or prevent fraud additionally our fraud risk continues to increase as third parties that handle confidential consumer information suffer security breaches and we expand our direct banking business and introduce new products and features our financial condition the level of our fraud chargeoffs and other results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fraudulent activity were to increase significantly highprofile fraudulent activity could negatively impact our brand and reputation in addition significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention and reputational and financial damage to our brands which could negatively impact the use of our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations sbna engages in transactions with its subsidiaries or affiliates that others may not consider to be on an armslength basis sbna and its subsidiaries have entered into a number of services agreements pursuant to which we render services such as administrative accounting finance treasury legal services and others sbna and its affiliates are likely to continue to engage in transactions with their respective affiliates future conflicts of interests among our affiliates may arise which conflicts are not required to be and may not be resolved in shusas favor risks related to pandemics and public health emergencies the covid19 pandemic materially impacted our business and a similar pandemic or public health emergency could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations covid19 was first reported in china in december and quickly spread throughout the world including the united states the outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern and a pandemic by the world health organization actions taken by authorities were not always implemented on a consistent basis contributing to the continued spread of covid19 further these actions were not always coordinated across jurisdictions and at times led to economic hardship in the jurisdictions in which they were implemented for example in many jurisdictions businesses were required to temporarily close or restrict their operations further even for businesses that remained open inperson interactions were limited and consumer demand deteriorated as a result we experienced a significant decline in our origination of loans and leases during the early stages of the covid19 pandemic although the world health organization has since declared an end to covid19 as a public health emergency certain adverse consequences of the pandemic continued to impact the macroeconomic environment in and may persist for some time if new covid19 waves the emergence of variants resistant to existing vaccines or any other highly contagious disease or public health emergencies force countries to readopt measures that restrict economic activity the macroeconomic environment could deteriorate and adversely impact our business and results of operations which could include but are not limited to i a continued decreased demand for our products and services ii material impairment of our loans and other assets including goodwill iii decline in the value of collateral iv constraints on our liquidity due to market conditions exchange rates and customer withdrawal of deposits and continued draws on lines of credit and v downgrades to our credit ratings moreover our operations could still be impacted by risks from remote work or bans on nonessential activities if as a result of any future public health emergency we become unable to operate our business from remote locations successfully including for example due to failures of our technology infrastructure increased cybersecurity risks or governmental restrictions that affect our operations this could result in business disruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on our business the resurgence of covid19 or other variants or any future outbreak of any other highly contagious disease or other public health emergency may have adverse effects on our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations or increase the likelihood of experiencing other risks described in these risk factors technology and cybersecurity risks any failure to effectively maintain secure improve or upgrade our it infrastructure and management information systems in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on us our ability to remain competitive depends in part on our ability to maintain protect and upgrade our it on a timely and costeffective basis we must continually make significant investments and improvements in our it infrastructure in order to meet the needs of our customers there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the level of capital expenditures necessary to support the continuous improvement and upgrading of our it inf rastructure in the future to the extent we are dependent on any particular technology or technological solution we may be harmed if that technology or technological solution becomes noncompliant with existing industry standards fails to meet or exceed the capabilities of our competitors comparable technologies or technological solutions becomes increasingly expensive to service retain and update becomes subject to thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement misappropriation or other violation or malfunctions or functions in a way we did not anticipate additionally new technologies and technological solutions are continually being released accordingly it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in improving our technologies functionality there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully adopt new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete and better ones become available any failure to improve or upgrade our it infrastructure and management information systems effectively and in a timely and costefficient manner could have a material adverse effect on us risks relating to data collection processing storage systems and security are inherent in our business like other financial institutions with a large customer base we have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the subject of attempted cyberattacks in light of the fact that we receive manage process hold and transmit proprietary and sensitive or confidential information including that of our customers and employees in the conduct of our banking operations as well as a large number of assets our business depends on the ability to process a large number of transactions efficiently and accurately and on our ability to rely on our digital technologies computer and email services spreadsheets software and networks as well as on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our thirdparty service providers the proper and secure functioning of financial controls accounting and other data collection and processing systems is critical to our businesses and our ability to compete effectively cybersecurity incidents and data losses can result from inadequate personnel inadequate or failed internal control processes and systems or external events or actors that interrupt normal business operations we also face the risk that the design of our cybersecurity controls and procedures proves to be inadequate or is circumvented although we work with our clients thirdparty service providers counterparties and other external parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and prevent information security risk we routinely exchange personal confidential and proprietary information by electronic means which may be a target for attempted cyberattacks this is especially applicable in the current environment in which there has been a shift in recent years to workfromhome policies for a significant portion of the workforce as they access our secure networks remotely if we cannot maintain effective and secure electronic data and information management and processing systems or if we fail to maintain complete physical and electronic records the result could be disruptions to our operations claims from customers regulators employees and other parties violations of applicable privacy and other laws regulatory sanctions and serious reputational and financial harm to us many companies across the country and in the financial services industry have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems cybersecurity risks have increased significantly in recent years due to the development and proliferation of new technologies increased use of the internet and telecommunications technology to conduct financial transactions and increased sophistication and activities of organized crime groups statesponsored and individual hackers terrorist organizations disgruntled employees and other insiders activists and other threat actors financial institutions the government and retailers have in recent years reported cyber incidents that compromised data resulted in the theft of funds or the theft or destruction of corporate information and other assets we take protective measures and continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption we have policies practices and controls designed to prevent or limit disruptions to our systems and enhance the security of our infrastructure these include performing risk management for information systems that store transmit or process information assets identifying and managing risks to information assets managed by thirdparty service providers through ongoing oversight and auditing of the service providers operations and controls we develop controls regarding user access to software on the principle that access is forbidden to a system unless expressly permitted limited to the minimum amount necessary for business purposes and terminated promptly when access is no longer required we seek to educate and make our employees aware of information security and privacy controls and their specific responsibilities on an ongoing basis nevertheless while we have not experienced material losses or other material consequences relating to cyberattacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us our third parties or other external parties that our third parties rely on our systems software and networks as well as those of our clients thirdparty service providers counterparties and other third parties may be vulnerable to unauthorized access misuse computer viruses or other malicious code phishing attacks cyberattacks such as denial of service malware ransomware phishing and other events of a similar nature such events could result in security breaches or give rise to the manipulation or loss of significant amounts of personal proprietary or confidential information of our customers employees suppliers counterparties and other third parties disrupt sabotage or degrade service on our systems or result in the theft or loss o f significant levels of liquid assets including cash we may also be impacted by cyberattacks against national critical infrastructure in the geographic locations in which we operate such as telecommunications networks our it systems are dependent on such national critical infrastructure and cyberattacks against such infrastructure could affect our ability to service our customers negatively as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and increase in sophistication we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of our policies practices and controls to protect against all such circumstances that could result in disruptions to our systems this is because among other reasons the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including not only cybercriminals but also activists and states regarded by the international community to be rogue states threat actors may seek to gain access to our systems either directly or by using equipment or passwords belonging to employees customers thirdparty service providers or other authorized users of our systems in the event of a cyberattack or security breach affecting a third party entity on whom we rely our ability to conduct business and the security of our customer information could be impaired in a manner to that of a cyberattack or security breach affecting us directly we also may not receive information or notice of the breach in a timely manner or we may have limited options to influence how and when the cyberattack or security breach is addressed as financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected with central agents exchanges and clearinghouses they may be increasingly susceptible to negative consequences of cyberattacks and security breaches affecting the systems of such third parties it could take a significant amount of time for a cyberattack to be investigated during which time we may not be in a position to fully understand and remediate the attack and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences associated with a particular cyberattack the perception of a security breach affecting us or any part of the financial services industry whether correct or not could result in a loss of confidence in our cybersecurity measures or otherwise damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business should such adverse events occur we may not have indemnification or other protection from the third party sufficient to compensate or protect us from the consequences as attempted cyberattacks continue to evolve we may incur significant costs in our attempts to modify or enhance our protective measures against such attacks to investigate or remediate any vulnerability or resulting breach or in communicating cyberattacks to our customers an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information sent to or received from a client vendor service provider counterparty or third party or a cyberattack could result in our inability to recover or restore data that has been stolen manipulated or destroyed damage to our systems and those of our clients customers and counterparties violations of applicable privacy and other laws or other significant disruption of operations including disruptions in our ability to use our accounting deposit loan and other systems and our ability to communicate with and perform transactions with customers thirdparty service providers and other parties these effects could be exacerbated if we would need to shut down portions of our technology infrastructure temporarily to address a cyberattack if our technology infrastructure is not sufficiently redundant to meet our business needs while an aspect of our technology is compromised or if a technological or other solution to a cyberattack is slow to be developed even if we timely resolve the technological issues in a cyberattack a temporary disruption in our operations could adversely affect customer satisfaction and behavior expose us to reputational damage contractual claims regulatory supervisory or enforcement actions or litigation us banking agencies and other federal and state government agencies have increased their attention on cybersecurity and data privacy risks and have proposed enhanced risk management standards that would apply to us for example the california consumer privacy act requires among other things notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data and imposes increased privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information of indivi duals other states in which we do business or may in the future do business or from which we collect personal information of residents have adopted or are considering adopting similar laws during federal banking regulators established a cybersecurityrelated rule that would require banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible and within hours of incidents that among other things have materially disrupted or degraded or are reasonable likely to materially disrupt or degrade the banking organizations ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization or impact the stability of the financial sector this rule also imposes requirements on bank service providers to notify their affected banking organization customers of certain computersecurity incidents additionally in the sec adopted new rules related to disclosures of cybersecurity risk management strategy governance and incidents by public companies these new rules have two main components for domestic public companies disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents on form 8k within four business days of determining that a cybersecurity incident is material and annual disclosure of a companys risk management strategy and governance relating to cybersecurity matters on s may have adverse regulatory economic and reputational consequences if we are not able to file our periodic reports within the time periods prescribed by the sec among other consequences we would be unable to use form s3 registration statements until we have timely filed our sec periodic reports for a period of consecutive months our inability to use form s3 registration statements would increase the time and resources we need to spend if we choose to access the public capital markets
