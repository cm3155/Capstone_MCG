better than the improved guidance that we gave last quarter and finally we have continued to generate very strong growth in organic capital reached at the end of the year which is above our target range we in november paid a dividend new shares equivalent to per share and the board of directors intention is to go back to the to as soon as we can we are also proposing to our shareholders in the end of march a per share in cash against results josé antonio will review that in more detail the fullyear results but just to point out again that we delivered a billion underlying profit that suffered a increase in provisions due to covid with very good cost control as you can see and net operating income in constant euros as i mentioned which is up yearonyear again these underlying results and provisions represent a prudent approach to the covidrelated potential losses which we have been guiding through the year at the base of these strong underlying numbers is again our geographical and business diversification it has shown its worth in previous crises again in this one we have delivered robust performance in the americas i want to point out that north america has been our bestperforming region the best order and profit performance in with growth in loyal customers based on increased collaboration between mexico and the us importantly in the us we delivered billion net profit thats the statutory attributable profit and a growth in the underlying profit for the year europe we are very much focused on transforming the business what we call one europe is a new operating model were very confident this will lead us to results that will be increasingly positive we are basing our growth in revenues at an increasing productivity and importantly we have generated billion net cost savings excluding perimeter in the last two years and south america remains the growth engine for the group we have delivered rote but very importantly operating income increased on a yearonyear basis in brazil and loyal customers and customer loans grew at and and finally were also increasingly diversified by businesses you can see here cib very strong numbers wealth management also and our digital consumer bank which is the pro forma merger of santander consumer europe and openbank which is already of the total revenues i mentioned at the beginning that covid has been a challenge for all of us at the personal level we are very clear that our priority throughout and continues to be our people this is the best way that we can take care of our customers we have supported million of our customers with moratoria lending billion per day to smes and corporates we have also supported our communities in a very important way with million across the group in aid in different aspects and this is something which we are very keen because we know that that is at the base of our success for the future we are also during very focused on further embedding esg across the bank its something which is at the base again of our aim and i define it as being a more responsible bank we have continued supporting our customers in a transition to green this is something which we are absolutely very focused on billion in green financing as you can see since and going green ourselves banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 so in we were net zero in our own operations and this is something we will continue going forward we are promoting financial inclusion especially in the americas we supported about million credit to microentrepreneurs and also supporting society through scholarships and our support for universities very importantly we have continued to invest in our talent and also diversity we are aiming to continue in this line we are now close to of women in leadership positions a very diverse board in terms of nationalities backgrounds with women on the group board and again at the base of all of our strategy is a increasingly strong culture which we have defined as being simple personal and fair so after this introduction i will pass it over to josé antonio to give you a summary of both the group and the businesses in josé antonio josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa audio gap so excluding then total income remained stable as the decrease in activity and lower interest rates were offset by higher volumes the lower cost of deposits and good performance in global businesses we accelerate our cost reduction and we expect to keep on track in this year as a result net operating income in a very difficult year grew yearonyear in constant euros higher loanloss provisions due to the covid crisis with the cost of credit in line with our guidance during the year all in all underlying attributable profit reached million as i already mentioned we had a very positive fourth quarter we improved our business activity and customer revenue reached its highest figure in the last eight quarters finally we recorded in the year billion a negative net capital gains and provisions following the billion impairment we announced in june the bank has recorded charges of billion in the fourth quarter these charges in the fourth quarter were mainly restructuring cost in spain but also in other countries in europe due to the transformation process we are implementing to increase productivity and efficiency in europe we expect total restructuring cost in and of around billion and we expect savings of billion in and going through the pl along the main lines of the pl  customer revenue continue to consolidate this upward trend while trending towards the precovid levels growth in nii versus  with the highest nii in the last two years mainly driven by spain uk and south america fee income grew primarily backed by south america costs were up in the quarter partly affected by seasonality labor agreements in argentina and brazil were are the main drivers and higher technology expenses particularly in mexico as a result net operating income decreased quarteronquarter but was higher than in  taking a more detailed look at the customer revenue nii increased from higher lending and deposit volumes with more than offset the interest rate impact and negative regulatory impact in brazil particularly in brazil and poland net fee income was affected by the covid crisis in this environment our strategy remains focused on increasing customer loyalty and growth in higher valueadded services and products very positive quarter for cib and wealth management insurance together they represent of the fee income of the bank in costs you see the trends the figures speak by themselves in europe decrease in north america down mainly in the us down in south america cost increased excluding argentina due to the high inflation we expect to continue to reducing costs and improving our efficiency ratio in banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 going to the cost of credit the cost of credit stood in line with our expectations ana already mentioned the increasing the year due to expected higher expected macro scenario the increase largely reflects the ifrs forwardlooking view based on potential macroeconomic scenarios and collective and individual assessment to cover respected credit losses in these scenarios however the underlying trends in credit quality remain solid in npl decreased basis points coverage increased percentage points loanloss reserves increased billion to more than billion by stage we increased the stage billion due to the increase in the loan book stage billion and the stage remaining indiscernible this classification speaks about the underlying quality trends in the loan book when it comes to moratoria sampling weve got a we were very proactive in the moratoria some of them were offered by the bank to the customers some of them were mandatory by the different government at some point we have billion in moratoria so the majority of this has expired and used just of the expired moratoria are classified as stage of the active moratoria remain secured and is concentrated in europe mainly in portugal and in spain in portugal governmentmandated extension of our moratoria until september and in spain longer initial terms than other countries almost of the one you have in the scheme expire in the coming month although yesterday the spanish government took some actions to extend some moratoria for a specific sector having vulnerable people when it comes to capital the capital ratio reached after increasing sic basis points in the quarter and basis points in the year the basis points of organic generation partly offset by the impact of restructuring cost corporate transactions and market performance it also includes basis points related to an accrual of dividend payments based on the limits established by the ecb that allows a maximum payment of per share the fullyloaded core equity tier ratio was tangible net asset value was virtually stable since september although we took some restructuring cost charges as you had seen in the pl going to the regions and making some comments about the three regions and the main countries with the creation of one europe we are accelerating our business transformation to achieve with two main goals achieve superior growth and having a more efficient operating model regarding commercial activity loans grew boosted by sme and large corporation in spain mortgages in uk and cib portugal rose loan book deposit increased and mutual funds this growth is remarkable in europe moving to results underlying attributable profit amounted to billion in less than in affected by higher loan loss provisions in all markets so other points i want to mention is the cost decreases well ahead of our schedule ph where i comment before the total income net interest income remained flat but improving the later part of the year partly driven by the recovery in commercial activity and consumer lending and improvement in the cost of funding before going to more detail into santander spain and uk i would like to highlight santander consumer finance for positive performance in the year clearly outperforming the market showing high resilience in results and recovery in the second half of the year in  profit increased compared with an already strong  this is a business that clearly reflects the benefits of the diversification ana will describe later our price in ph the italian consumer bank in more detail in spain we have been very active in supporting our customers been very active with ico funding where we granted billion since the state of alarm was declared we have granted billion to selfemployed people banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 on corporates we made further progress in enhancing customer experience we are escalating in net promoter score in relation with our competitors the volumes grew loans grew and customer funds in the net in the income statement the profit for the year was million sic lower yearonyear by line the income fell basically due to the lower fee income in relation with the lockdowns we have had and also the reduced income from real estates and smaller alco performance ph comparison net interest income grew driven by the positive performance in volumes margin management and the positive contribution for tltros we had another positive year in cost dropping lastly loanloss provisions doubled driven by the expected potential losses in our macro scenario arising from the pandemic and several collective assessments in the most vulnerable sectors that say our portfolios credit quality remain solid npl decreased basis points indiscernible remain at lower levels than pre covid provided the different support programs in place indiscernible billion in december

significantly better than expected santander has once again recorded an excellent year both in terms of results and volumes while we remain focused on capturing growth opportunities commercial activity in the second half of the year exceeds precovid19 levels boosting revenue growth in the year and achieving doubledigit increases in volumes loans grew and customer funds fullyear net

good asset quality and continue to gain market share in the most important segments in the company taking a look to the global business corporate investment banking have excellent year we continue to support our customers increasing our market share income grew profit was higher driven by growth in the income we mentioned and cost reduction we grew double digit in our core business particularly in global markets and global debt financing in  profit declined as improvement performance of the improved performance in nii and fee was broadly offset by lower trading gains due to ph cba and lower volatility than in the third quarter and higher provisions related to covid19 specific names wealth management insurance the business performed well in the year the assets under management amounted to billion in line with december in constant euros in the quarter growth was total fee income generated accounted for of the groups total underlying attributable was up thanks to growth in revenues in private banking positive sales and business growth fees grew in santander asset management and strong volume rebound from the lows in may and further progresses in our esg strategy lastly in insurance underlying profit rose the main growth driver continued to be noncreditrelated business and now im turning over to ana to continue with the presentation banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea executive chairman banco santander sa so thank you so much josé antonio allow me now to say first of all again that i am really proud of the progress we have made since i am excited about the opportunities ahead and i would like to start by saying again that our aim and values remained the same as weve said for several years they provide very strong foundation for the santander of tomorrow whilst allowing us to develop today our aim is to be the best open financial services platform by acting responsibly and earning the lasting loyalty of all our stakeholders just a few minutes to show you how we have delivered results following the strategy for a number of years again our team and our approach to capital management and discipline have been key if we look back to the last six years to of course was the outlier we have doubled profits improved audio gap sorry i hadnt put the if we look back to our performance for the last six years was a clear outlier i just want to remind ourselves that we have doubled profits improved our underlying return on tangible equity by more than basis points in today very importantly and i think these numbers show the transformation of our model our capital base has grown by billion thats a increase with only a increase in rwas again testament to a radical change in the model which we will continue into the future and thats what gives us confidence again for the next few years if we look ahead we will continue following the strategy which has served us well allocating resources efficiently focusing on the profitable growth which makes us very different from many of our peers and of course shareholder value creation we will continue to grow our rorwa organically again most of this growth will continue from our businesses in the americas in terms of segments well continue to invest and expand on our feebased and capitalized businesses corporate investment banking wealth management and payments through pagonxt and of course the digital consumer bank which is as i will explain again in a few minutes the pro forma merger of santander consumer and openbank this should lead us to a growth in earnings per share and tangible nav per share which in turn would underpin cash dividend growth bringing us to the path of the to cash payout as soon as regulators allow us to capture organic profitable growth we will continue to invest in the higher return and capitalized geographies and businesses we have made progress again in in accretive capital rebalancing first by ph reweighting our capital to these more profitable geographies mainly the americas to higher return and capitallight businesses cib wealth management insurance and payments we have been setting minimum profitability thresholds in all segments also and very very important we have a lot of focus on faster asset rotation and we have aligned the top management remuneration with these profitability goals as a result in this is an important number in what has been again a difficult year about of our capital has delivered doubledigit underlying return on tangible equity so as we look to the santander of tomorrow we have three priorities for this profitable growth there is no doubt that our industry is going to continue to be challenging even in a postcovid world low interest rates increasing competition but we have very clear three strategic priorities to build on our foundations including the one santander a new operating model second pagonxt and third the digital consumer bank again think of this of further leveraging our scale and using technology to strengthen customers loyalty but also to access new fee based revenue pools i will go now through each one of these banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 so what do we mean when we say one santander what we are really saying is that we are aiming to create a much better bank for our customers to drive growth to drive profitable growth we have made huge progress in the last few years i just shared with you the numbers of these five years six years which showed that but we want to accelerate this transformation we created the regions now with the one santander we are redefining again our operating model we want to make sure that we can leverage our million customers and also based on clear principles the first one is simplify its the key word here simplify our mass market value proposition redefine how we interact with our customers and further leverage the capacity we have across europe and then across the group to build together and create a common model to share processes and do this across markets this is not just in the one europe were doing that across the americas and this is what will allow us to reach top three nps in nine countries over of total sales will be digital and to further improve our efficiency ratio to about we will follow very clear milestones as we execute along these three priorities if i turn first to the one europe the one europe goal is to go to to underlying return on tangible equity and an efficiency ratio of we will work across all regions but especially in europe to leverage the payments platform the pagonxt global solutions that i have referred to in north america continued focus on collaboration between the two countries we are seeing increase in revenues in in areas like commercial banking and cib and targeting to return on tangible equity and efficiency in the medium term south america were expanding getnet and superdigital to other countries we did announce yesterday afternoon in brazil the listing of getnet brazil i will comment on that later and our aim is to deliver an underlying return on tangible equity of to compared to the for the region this year and efficiency so allow me to turn to the second priority which is pagonxt pagonxt is a global payments company where were bringing together different assets across the group initially its going to focus very much on two segments first is the merchant acquiring and second the smes but will also be looking to the consumer segment payments is not a new strategy its not a new priority payments has always been at the core of our loyalty strategy and this is what allows us to earn the loyalty of our customers santander has the scale to become one of the top global payment platforms in the world merchant acquiring is a global revenue pool of billion its a fastgrowing market especially on the ecommerce globally growing at international trade again global revenue pool of billion also growing globally we already have significant scale in these businesses so we have a very strong starting point in merchant acquiring for example we have more than a million active merchants and business customers and million active credit and debit in trade we will leverage our more than million sme customers this is probably one of the biggest in the banking world and over smes that are trading internationally think of pagonxt as the backbone the technology backbone that will allow our banks the one santander to leverage our scale to really have million customers in one place with common products this is what pagonxt is aiming for and to build those products that are essential to our customers most important to our customers will allow us to grow faster but very importantly to deliver a better customer experience the aim is that this will be a single autonomous company and will probably be one of the largest private fintech companies in the world again we announced yesterday the listing during of getnet brazil so you can have much better visibility about all these revenues that are highgrowth revenues inside our business banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 so i already mentioned focus on merchant and trade solutions i just want to point out here that this is not starting from scratch and these are just two examples where we are building our own software our own solutions and this is brazil and spain where as you can see here market share growing from to in brazil in spain from to growing at where we also bought back our acquiring stake from elavon so again we believe we can build better solutions ourselves we have the scale and we have proven it works we are now going to bring all of these together and we will bring together getnet brazil with our getnet global platform with wirecard ph with sems in a single company for acquiring our vision on the trade side is to deliver fast and efficient trade finance supplychain and fx payments again this is not starting from scratch weve made significant investments and progress we already have customers onboarded into what is a global platform and ebury is at the heart of this trade strategy ebury has generated more than million in net revenues transactions even in a challenging environment they have grown the number of transactions per customer and growing about on the year another of the key assets for trade is the payments hub again this is an internal development it went live and became the main sepa provider for ebury last quarter in december our payments hub processed over million in incoming payments weve reached agreement to become the main payments engine for all our corporate bank in london paris milan frankfurt hong kong and new york it is already servicing third parties outside santander and finally mercury is the platform that has allowed us to finance million of which of the trades were done digitally again more than customers have already been onboarded and just interesting fact is that in many of these imports were related to medical supplies so the third priority the way santander is going to become an open financial services platform how were going to grow and every time and im sure ill get a question from you in terms of are we going to do ma well we do not need to do banking ma we aim to grow in new markets through our digital consumer bank this is the pro forma merger of santander consumer in europe and openbank openbank is the first european bank running fully on the cloud approved endtoend by the ecb we are very confident that this is a strategy that will deliver great results the reason for that is that openbank includes already very successful strategy in terms of cross selling but as you can see here we are going to merge that with a very significant consumer operation so santander consumer brings merchant pos openbank million customers million new consumers per year in markets in the case of santander consumer and also the santander auto where we are servicing dealers and with a very high quality and growth franchise we are aiming that the digital consumer bank will run on a digital banking api model a saas model and this is crucial as it will allow us to fully leverage the data for both sides of the business and generate growth but also fundamentally change the way we operate our consumer business this would lead and this is the ambition to grow revenues and double pat in the mediumterm reaching underlying return on tangible this is something which will take a few years but its really a new paradigm we will be using common apps single streamlined operating model simplified license we have already started on this as we launched openbank in germany holland and portugal and a very different way of running the business it will enable new auto consumer lending but also new products to the consumer customers i want to point out and josé antonio gave some facts santander consumer finance in and this goes back to the diversification delivered revenue growth in a very challenging year underlying return on tangible in as i said our ambition is now bigger we aim for efficiency and underlying returns banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 we have painted this as a flywheel because i think this is the best way to picture how the combination of these two businesses is going to really power growth its a virtuous circle and if you start what we have built over the years our significant customer base at the top through merchants they offer consumer financing at checkout to customers merchants go from large to small across industries many started as an offline but now are adding online capabilities and of course we have a very fast growth in onlineonly businesses this generates about million contracts we actually already have digital customers and were now expanding to other sectors such as telecom and education these new digital customers are our target for other lending products insurance we believe theres significant growth opportunity for both our lending and our digital banking services and of course this gives us significant data at the point of the first transaction which gives us very valuable insights into these customers current and future financial needs then these new customers are candidates for other banking products through openbank these are oneclick signups even for a loan one click new current account customers of course generate new deposits these are loyalty strategy provide in turn low funding for lending i mentioned already that our digital bank averages products per customer but let me say also that in we grew by more than new customers yearonyear again the api services in turn attract new merchants in turn add new customers again the flywheel spins creating data depth and insights and of course revenue growth so just to end wanted to reiterate that based on the latest imfoecd outlook our goals are cost income ratio below for cost of credit trending downwards from to underlying return on tangible for the medium term midsingledigit revenue growth in constant euros bestinclass nps again this is the goal for the new operational model and we want to reiterate the following goals that we communicated in of to underlying return on tangible equity to cet1 and the boards intention to restore the payout of to on underlying so in summary we have delivered in again strong underlying results that show the resiliency of our model diversification again has proved that it has value it has delivered robust performance in the americas solid growth in our global businesses providing balance against a more challenging environment in europe robust credit quality deteriorating by just basis points thanks to active risk management we have continued to build organic capital reaching to above our target we have a strong capital position we are comfortable with these current capital levels and buffers and especially we are well placed to continue allocating capital through the internal significant opportunities for profitable growth to create value and we have a clear strategy going forward for that ive just reviewed which gives us a high degree of confidence that we will deliver on our mediumterm goals so thank you again very much and we are now available for questions sergio gámez martínez global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa yes indeed thank you ana josé antonio please now we have time for our qa so go ahead we can go ahead with the qa session banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 question and answer section operator thank you very much ladies and gentlemen the qa session starts now operator instructions thank you the first question comes from jernej omahen from goldman sachs please go ahead jernej omahen q analyst goldman sachs yes first of all good morning from my side im just going to ask two questions please the first one is on the return on tangible equity target and how that could translate into tangible book value per share growth i guess weve seen santander records considering the circumstances high levels of underlying profitability but the tangible book value per share went backwards this year for reasons that were all familiar with i mean what gives you the confidence that if you meet the target that youve set yourself for this year that they will translate into tangible book value per share growth as well and then the second question i have is on the eba stress tests theyve announced the underlying assumptions for these tests and some of them seemed to be very very severe i mean just forecasting a perpetual recession pretty much and i was wondering to what extent if at all do you expect the results of the tests to drive the supervisory decisions around capital return dividends buybacks et cetera thank you very much ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so thank you so much so this year tangible nav as youve seen and you said it has been very affected by exchange rates we are working very hard on continuing and accelerating the change in the model which we have really done a lot of that in the last five six years at the end its about reallocating capital to profitable growth first second ensuring diversification us has given us a very good return in dollars so we need to ensure a proper balance between higher volatility currencies and the more lets say stable currencies like the dollar and the euro i say this maybe the pound also so that is really the main way we are planning to improve the tangible nav continuous capital reallocation to the higher growth and profitability ensuring the balance and diversification through the cycle if we look at the to mediumterm target i can say first its based on revenue growth so we are saying midsingledigit revenue growth as the basis of that if we look at the shorter term in terms of were looking to volume growth based on volumes especially in the americas we are looking at positive assets repricing we are looking at delivering half of the billion so million additional reduction in cost in europe and the cost of credit that trend downwards so again really doing everything weve done this year but just doing it a bit more and a bit better for and for the medium term focusing on these three priorities this year we have already seen i think josé antonio mentioned that its not just the corporate investment bank and wealth management which are now close to again these are higher lets say higher return on capital businesses but acquiring on payments through pagonxt should also help us a lot on this change in the model on the eba stress test yeah there are some issues there that maybe josé antonio wants to comment however we feel that our capital buffers and our diversification the fact that our preprovision profit this year which is around billion we could double provisions of and still not eat into capital the buffers we have even after that of billion billion all of that gives us confidence that whatever happens with the stress test i banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 dont know if youre going to give some details on there are some issues in the stress test that mean that we might be penalized but i dont know how you want to josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa well as you know jernej in the stress test weve been performing very well we were a top performer there our capital depletion was lower than our conservation buffer and well we have a p2g on top of this yeah so we expect to continue to perform well there although the synergies are more severe and there are two issues that weve been raising over time that particularly affect emerging market exposure like our case that is the static balance sheet that is probably as you know in emerging markets loan books particularly are very short run and in one year you renew the whole balance sheet but it is what it is and the second one that is new somehow new is the provisions on the emerging markets are not allowed to depreciate with the depreciation of the currency that while technically speaking is not very natural but it is what it is having said that we continue to expect during our diversification and the resilience of our business model and the stronger we have the stronger preprovision profit in the industry and we continue to perform well on our capital depletion being among the lowest in the industry ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa yeah if i may add just another for context we have had in years probably two of the biggest global crises that have happened in decades and just to understand the stability in our model if we look at our performance in underlying profit in about billion thats more than double what we had at the low point in and in in the crisis again it shows that weve made a lot of progress and of course this with more capital than we had then so again the stability in our earnings diversification and how we perform on the stress i think is evident from what we have done in two global crises so far sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks jernej next question please operator thank you the next question comes from ignacio ulargui from exane bnp paribas please go ahead ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas hi good morning everyone thanks for taking the questions i just have two questions and one is on the fee strategy and just wanted to get a bit of your thoughts on how do you see this sort of like new business additions on payment wealth management or investment banking tools to be ph having to make a bit more dynamic performance on fees so i mean i do see a very clear tailwind from the bit of the unwinding of the strategy in terms of funding costs and that is being very visible in nii in the uk and also in spain so i mean just wanted to get a bit of your thoughts on how do you see fees into the next couple of years and i mean what is the relevance of the payments business on that process and also second question is on the brazilian business and it has been a very good performance much better than what we expected at the beginning of the year in this pandemic i mean which levers do you plan to take just to continue improving the contribution of the country to the group thanks banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so the growth in fees would continue to come from cib wealth management of course also retail is incredibly important and insurance so the one europe strategy but also in the americas retail fees are also a big driver it is clear that theres still uncertainty over the next few months so we could have in the first half not a great performance in fees thats yet something which will depend a lot on the health situation but what we have seen is that once and we see that in the second half of the year that once things open up a bit the performance is much better on the payments you will see again with the listing of getnet brazil just a flavor of what we can do in this space the key thing here is that we already have performed incredibly well in acquiring in brazil or spain within a couple of years of having our own lets say payments factory once we extend this to other countries you ask about the timing thats always difficult but i would say a few years weve said medium term you should see a very significant increase coming from these areas you want to answer on brazil i mean brazil i think its every time brazil or we have a crisis theres always uncertainty as to the performance but it actually has done a very good job and again remember that brazil has historically low rates so we now have a bit steeper interest rate curve which is also positive and we are looking to growth in volumes and positive assets repricing for i think i said that already for and cost of risk trending downward in general in all our geographies once more than others and there could be variations there but i think thats really the picture for brazil and of course the lower rates mean that that helps customers for payments and good performance i think as they exit moratoriums is that roughly josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yeah its basically we rely on volumes we expect to keep growing doubledigit in brazil as we did in so this is probably the main lever margins more stable than the ones we had in in remember that we have the regulatory impact of what they call their personal check that is kind of ph overdraft that affected significantly their nim and nii and well at the end the driver is market share gains and our capacity to keep growing the number of customers and you see the number of customers in the country had been booming in the last years yeah so we are still there and i already mentioned getnet indiscernible getnet is an example we can go to auto finance where our market share is you can go to agro business where weve gone from market share to market share and we keep accounting in corporate world our cost of risk went down and in cib were a market leader so well the franchise has a very good momentum and we expect to continue these trends yeah sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks ignacio next question please operator thank you the next question comes from ignacio cerezo from ubs please go ahead ignacio cerezo q analyst ubs ag london branch banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 yeah hi good morning and thank you for the presentation two questions from me the first one if you can clarify or give us some colors around regulatory headwinds on capital in and and the second question is on the us business obviously the cost of risk performance has been very positive in the year and much lower than could be anticipated probably at the beginning of the year theres a new stimulus plan coming with probably the possibility of cash and checks actually being handed again to customers do we have to still expect an increase of provisions in sc usa in particular or do you think the level of provisions in is sustainable for the future thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so let me answer the us and then ill pass over to you josé antonio so in terms of the us weve been reviewing this in line with the peers that have presented results were very much aligned with our peers regional and even the large banks if we compare likesforlikes in term of portfolios we believe were being prudent provisioning so i would expect that to continue into the stimulus is going to be obviously very important for this and so there is really nothing there which should be out of line with the rest of our peers again if you compare portfolios of the same type of segments i mean some of the larger banks have more ci than we do and thats why youve seen some reversals that is not the case for us and in terms of the consumer lender again were in the range of our peers but it has performed very well we believe that will continue to be the case until in terms of do you want to answer the other question josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yeah in terms of capital regulatory headwinds in we were the impact of the different regulatory changes were around ph relatively above basis points in you mentioned and well in that they have more visibility we are still continuing to see some impacts coming from basically all the trim review of the models lowdefault portfolios all these issues that probably will come difficult to say always when you face this but we expect to be lower the impact than the one we had in that i remember was ph relatively above basis points and in well probably the trend is downward clearly we spent indiscernible trim goes and all the review of the models and all these things we will capture significant riskweighted asset reduction in some models that we are building sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks ignacio next question please operator thank you the next question comes from francisco riquel from alantra please go ahead francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes and thank you for taking my questions and first one i wonder if you can comment a bit more on the getnet listing in brazil if you plan to offload more assets from pagonxt into this unit and what are your ambitions with this listing if you plan to eventually monetize this asset or not banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 and second question is a followup on the us business so you mentioned operationally i wonder if you can update strategically your views about the us retail business i have also seen that you have frontloaded some restructuring expenses if you can also comment on these costcutting plans here thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so at the moment we have just announced the listing of getnet brazil this is not selling of shares its just a listing of getnet brazil we are as i explained on pagonxt well be giving more information during the course of the goal is that pagonxt include three types of businesses but really mainly two one is acquiring business where we will be bringing together getnet brazil with getnet global platform and eventually wirecard which we closed just a few days ago and ph sems so that would be a global merchant acquirer eventually but getnet its about a listing in terms of the trade its also going to be part of pagonxt so there we have ebury mercury the payments hub and probably other products related to trade so we have all of that in the global platform we believe that is a very interesting business its a highgrowth business in paymentsrelated activities in some cases we have already given service to third parties like in the payments hub so that is really the goal with pagonxt and getnet josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa well the second question about the us strategy ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa yeah the us josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa and i may take the costcutting in the us ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa yeah josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa were going to continue to naturally to track to improve efficiency in the us well we have two angles there there are probably there is more efficiency gains to make in the bank while sc usa is growing and probably the cost will go up overall in the us i will say the costs going forward will be quite flattish yeah in the whole us but not specific restructuring cost in the way we are doing in europe no this is not in our vision for in our plans for ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 yeah in terms of the strategic view of the us first is that the us market is the best riskreturn market probably in the world aside from being large and a source of talent and innovation institutional stability their strong and increasing connections not just to latam but to europe and whats very important is that both santander consumer and sbna are working increasingly together a lot of the origination in santander consumer is financed by sbna so we look at the us as a country not as pieces of a different business this is not different by the way to what we do in brazil or europe and again this year we have had some positive oneoffs but even in constant currency we have had an increase in profits from the us and the adjusted returns once we adjust for excess capital which will not be there forever actually are at or even a bit above the cost of equity depending how you see that of so there are no plans to sell the business and we are working as in the one europe with increasing connectivity not just in terms of working with customers across different santander countries again i think i mentioned in corporate investment bank and commercial we are seeing increases yearonyear but also in building together and so this is incredibly important it was not an option a few years ago today you can leverage the same way you can build for poland uk and spain you can build for mexico us and eventually why not brazil or europe so this is really the very different approach to the management of the business which is what we are calling the one santander new operating model so again we are very focused on growing in a profitable way and building on the foundations of the last few years sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks paco next question please operator the next question comes from carlos cobo from société générale please go ahead carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain hello thank you very much for the presentation and the extra detail on your vision for the future going a little bit back to the numbers of the quarter could you touch on the regulatory impacts for again sorry to insist have you said below the basis points in the last guidance that i had was an impact of to basis points in are you still comfortable with that or there is some room for slightly higher impact just to finetune the model and then two quick questions a more strategic if payments is a global business and thats how you present it why listing the brazilian subsidiary just for me to understand why starting that why not being more global in the listing and the second question will be on covid losses could you try to help us to gain a little bit more confidence on whats the vision or the outlook for whats the scenario of the default study youve covered for because without the regulatory forbearance and the support from the indiscernible rolling over the grace periods from capital amortization and on the restructuring of credits we dont really have any visibility it doesnt feel like is the year to see the big increase in npl so whats the scenario that you have for where we should assume further progress in the cost of risk reduction whats the percentage of total say stage loans you start to default and how much of that has been covered already thank you very much banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so i will take the strategic ones and then i will you can answer the capital and the covid but in terms of the getnet listing in brazil this is the first step the reason for that is exactly that what you said was the goal is to create a global platform which would be lets say parallel to the banks so think about the one santander the bank says owning customer relationships think about pagonxt as a global platform for acquiring which provides the backbone lets say product factory for payment this is really how we think about it and so this is just the first step to create that global acquiring platform which would allow us to add value to not just do payments our vision is that payments will happen we will not actually do payments but they will be the cornerstone of value added services so again its not about a processing business its about a valueadded services business to our customers built of course on the eventually on the processing but its more than that and to do that we actually need to have it all together outside our listed banks but also outside our nonlisted banks i hope that answers the question we are we will be giving more information and adding to this during and a lot more a year from now again these are assets we have been building individually for the last five years we have shown they work and now we want to make sure we take it to the next level we have been rightly so challenged by investors and analysts you guys why do you not work better across countries well we have done that in cib in wealth management we are now going to do that for mass market and smes so think of pagonxt and our payments businesses as providing a global platform where we can truly leverage the million customers that we have in retail that we have in smes million of them that we have in merchants and again well provide further clarity but this is really the vision so i think the second question was again on the regulatory headwinds i believe for and covid losses josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yeah the first one well i already elaborated on the regulatory capital impacting that we expect to be lower than the one in the main impact comes from the indiscernible from the models and well we expect like two stages there the first stage is to go up and to have an impact in and the second stage once we get ph more than whats approved remember that we still have significant amount of our portfolio under standard models some of our models our risk weighting is higher than our competitors and at some point we will converge with this in the mediumterm so in the short run the numbers i gave you is lower impact than in in the mediumterm we expect some positives from this side probably to split this ir can talk to you in the small numbers and in more detail on this on the covid losses if i understood you well youre asking about okay so we guide you in to this is an area naturally this is an area of uncertainty and everything is based on models we still have the health crisis going on what do we expect we say as ana mentioned before we are working with kind of imf indiscernible so with this scenario we expect this year the cost of risk to go down from the we had and start the convergence towards the in i dont have any reason to think if we were right in anticipating our indiscernible in the ifrs forwardlooking we build billion of capital provisions that till now are in our balance sheet that we expect this to banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 cover the majority if not all the losses that arise from this can we be wrong in the scenario maybe maybe more negative or more positive but we are relatively comfortable with this and we even in the quarter we ph didnt review our scenarios our portfolios building provisions accordingly with conservative and prudent approach and i do think from the i will bet on reducing in and reducing again in so this will be my initial expectation sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you carlos the next question please operator thank you the next question comes from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley hello good morning ive got a couple of questions i guess on capital allocation the first one hopefully the capital build journey is now over when i think about going forward it sounds like clearly the emphasis of growth is still americas but it sounds like it would be a bit more balanced than previously if i think about the pagonxt the digital and the consumer bank initiatives obviously getnet was a tremendous success because basically you returned back to your natural market share with the acquisitions like wirecard in germany and the push to become a global payments platform how should we think about you achieving sort of growth outside your natural footprint what gives you that confidence and second on openbank and consumer bank youre aiming to double profits i think it is which is quite i mean it feels ambitious maybe you can talk us through which regions do you expect to grow most and again if some of it is outside your natural sort of footprint like germany although youve got the consumer bank there clearly but what are the growth sources where in the regions there and the second question also is more sector level is around obviously the sector the inability to distribute is accumulating capital not just for you but across europe and i would love to hear your thoughts and do you think this is going to have long lasting effects in terms of competition do you think it can trigger sort of ma and even crossborder ma and in that sort of sense ive heard you loud and clear several times that you dont need to do ma but what would it take for santander to be open to crossborder ma or ma in general what would you be looking for thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so you have heard me say and i will repeat loud and clear were not interested in crossborder ma in europe we need further significant changes on the regulatory side took for that to begin to be something we might look at we are and as youve seen in the last month we are much more active on the digital and payment side we believe that we already have enough customers enough scale theres a lot of talk about scale you need scale we have achieved cost income were guiding to even lower than that in the next few years because we do have scale we are the number one bank and i say number one bank across europe and the americas in terms of number of customers this is the scale that matters second our revenues with stable revenues in a year like i think that is remarkable and so that is the scale we are aiming for we have guided to single sorry midsingle digit revenue growth for the medium term even in and again theres lots of uncertainty in the first few months and that could affect our revenues in the first banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 few months especially on fees but we feel confident that after what weve done in that we have the scale to drive revenues and we have the scale to drive with pagonxt with the digital consumer bank to drive profitable growth so again not planning to at ma crossborder ma but rather looking at additional digital opportunities in terms of doubling the profit on the digital consumer bank that is going to be driven a lot by revenues ie million active customers in santander consumer europe million new consumer customers every year i encourage you to look at the flywheel and again any questions please very happy to if you come back to us but this is very important because we have the data we have the customers and now we have a goto model which i dont think any of our peers have which is the openbank so think of openbank as giving us the knowhow to offer new banking products to customers that we dont need to invest to acquire because were already acquiring them by the way profitably on the consumer side this is crucially important this is a virtuous circle that i described in the flywheel and thats what gives us confidence that we can do that now its going to take a few years so its not going to be in or but three four years down the road what youre going to see is a change in the paradigm in terms of how we run our consumer business and how that consumer business that is there its real its over billion in profits i believe this year in lots of customers and the openbank tech stack which is modern runs fully on the cloud and its not just about the customer experience its also about how we run the business in all the support functions we can expand to holland we can expand to germany with very limited cost increases actually in all these support functions in a way that is very prudent and under control so thats the reason we are again not putting a date on this but you should be seeing in the next few years and finally on pagonxt and the acquisitions so it should all come together again it will take a few years because there are several assets across europe and the americas and the goal there again is to increase growth and the way were looking to do that is by valueadded services and payments by delivering for example for smes a much better crossborder experience for smes that trade at a higher growth smes we have of those we are already testing for example with ebury we have a great partnership with ebury were able to offer services we were not offering before and vice versa we are helping ebury for example to run the business in the way we run it in some areas which is very important these days so we think that its a winwin combination and thats where we will be looking to integrate so we can grow faster sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you next question please operator thank you the next question comes from daragh quinn from kbw please go ahead daragh quinn q analyst kbw hi good morning thanks for taking my questions its daragh from kbw one question just on the capital targets and dividends youve generated capital this year and headed back towards your targets presumably even if we forecast your cash dividend you would still be looking to generate capital organically could you just say maybe how that would change your natural outlook for the level of capital you think you should be holding in the future banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 and then on the dividend can you just confirm that there wont be that youre not planning any scrip dividends in the future because obviously that has been one of the headwinds in the past to nav per share growth and on the business side of things maybe just if you could give a quick comment on the margin in two geographies one in the uk which youve seen quite a strong improvement in margin and nii over the last couple of quarters as youve changed the pricing policy on the ph accounts if you could just comment on where things go from here and the outlook for in the uk and on the us excluding the consumer business it looks like theres just been very ongoing weak margin nii performance from the banking business maybe if you could just provide a little bit of color of whats going on there and what your outlook is thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so on capital our targets are to be between and there is we believe going forward were going to have more capital flexibility as youve sort of hinted that we are planning to go back to the to on an underlying profit distribution on an underlying basis as soon as were allowed to do that and the most important thing is that even in a difficult year we have made further progress in what we call the transformation of the model it happens at an operating level which is whats driving the financial transformation the operational goal the one santander new operating model is actually building for example a common mobile app across europe just build once and use across different countries on a financial level it means that we grow our earnings while growing capital but we grow less our balance sheet and lending in proportion to that growth and again thats whats going to allow us to generate more organic capital and better profitability we are not the scrip is i know weve gone back in to a scrip and again we need to keep a balance between institutional investors and also retail and the scrip was the only way we could give some dividend even though it wasnt shares to our retail the board and management intention as we have said many times for the last six years is to go to cash this is what we are intending for and we will get news on what is the recommendation from the ecb for european banks in  well be accruing a cash dividend this year hopefully we can return that to shareholders in sometime in  or  of next year in terms of the business and how thats performing ill let josé antonio answer that but i would say that both the more challenging region this year has been without doubt europe but uk and spain which have been the hardest hit from an economic point of view and therefore we have our customers and therefore we have also reflected that but the last couple of quarters have been quite encouraging there is a lot of uncertainty but remember weve seen lockdowns in spain being very very id say probably at the level of the more difficult ones right now so we know what happens in a lockdown we know what happens to activity to the top line and both the uk and spain have shown on a quarteronquarter basis to increase in net interest income and doing much better also on fees so and the transformation of the uk is not just about revenues and by the way uk has done really well in terms of mortgage growth growing billion in mortgages and actually more or less the same on business loans so again volumes have done well margins are improving and very importantly very very strong performance in costs again not just the uk spain yearonyear is reducing cost by i want to stress that our focus in both the uk and spain is going to be growth in revenues but of course better through better experience for our customers but the new operating model will obviously is going to be also reducing our cost we think of it as productivity and i said i believe that we will be our aim is to reduce million of the billion additional cost we announced in so in the us sbna as i said is part of the us banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 03feb2021 business with consumer and net interest income in at has gone up by total sbna has gone up by santander consumer by so in spite of the lower rates doing well and net interest income if you want to think about the retail side separate from the consumer side even though increasingly theyre working together i would also say that for the last few years weve been more concentrated on regulatory remediation controls setting up the structural basis for growth so you should start seeing a different behavior of our business in the next couple of years again we are very proud that in a year like this the us has been i can say our best performing country at least in terms of the bottom line and growth and profits do you want to add anything on the business uk i think i josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yeah ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa
