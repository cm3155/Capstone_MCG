santander as every quarter we have as speakers our group ceo mr álvarez and our group chief financial officer mr josé cantera our ceo will address the group performance for the nine month of and then our cfo will follow up with the business review in more detail before jumping to the key takeaways of the quarter by our ceo and obviously happy to answer your questions during the qa session afterward so josé antonio please the mic is yours josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay thank you sergio and good morning to everyone first of all i hope that you and your families friends and relatives are doing well let me to go straight to the third quarter results i will qualify the results are this quarter a very positive quarter within the environment arising from the covid crisis we have improved significantly the quarterly trends in business activity and results and activity if the second quarter was pretty strong on the corporate side the third quarter will recover significantly the activity coming more for individuals and this reflect the in the underwriting of both mortgages and consumer lending as long as the growth in deposits the profit in the quarter was billion increase in underlying terms compared with the previous quarter higher in constant euros all the regions are performing better than in the previous quarter in the first nine months we maintained a solid top line performance the preprovision profit under this scenario and i want to stress you this in constant euros grew driven by resilient customer revenue and our cost reduction plan in credit quality i will elaborate later on in more detail billion out of the billion or billion that we had in moratoria of payment holidays already expired and the behavior has been pretty good only went into stage well the future continue to be highly uncertain but for this year its we expect a lower cost of ph written one we got during the first q so as cost of risk now probably going to be around for on the capital side we continue to build capital with a strong capital generation basis points in the quarter after the dividend accrual of basis points this morning at the agm we present to shareholders and they approved the scrip dividend of per share and a cash dividend for next year to be paid in cash next year provide that the regulators allow us to do so so if we go to the pl straight to the pl what we see is first i should mention the exchange rate the impact was significant in the quarter you see ph both in revenues is between and points in the different banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 lines of the account this has been particularly strong in the real in brazil the impact and you see the difference in those two figures excluding the impact of looking at the business in constant euros the income remained stable as the decrease in activity and lower interest rates were offset by higher volumes so much market volatility and lower cost of deposits we accelerate our cost reduction and we have good news good perfect this for the coming quarters as a result of our underlying profits show significant resilience and net operating income rose yearonyear in constant euros finally higher loanloss provisions due to covid19 related provisions although this quarter came more in line with the second than with the first quarter where we did the overlay that you already know in chart on the right you can see how earnings speak stronger in the quarter with the following detail by lines the revenue grew quarteronquarter while growth in net interest income highest nii in the last seven quarters mainly driven by spain uk us and brazil so pretty wellspread across the board upturn in net income as a result of higher activity and this happens all across our markets we recorded lower gains in the indiscernible in the second quarter cib indiscernible very good quarter that we couldnt repeat in the third quarter costs were up and this partly reflect adjustments that we did in the second quarter due to the expectation of lower personnel cost in the year related with the low the expected performance as a result net operating income was up quarteronquarter and higher than the  that i will say as i said at the beginning is remarkable loanloss provisions fell due to the high level of provisions related to covid19 in the second quarter the main trends over the last quarter are supported by all the regions you see all the regions growing revenues all the regions having a good cost control and very positive preprovision profit performance increasing in all the regions with highly resilient nii and efficiency improvement going to capital in the quarter we finished the previous quarter we continue to generate capital with a strong generation basis points organic generation in the quarter we accrued basis points in order to be able to pay dividend next year indiscernible so additionally we had several positive impacts from corporate transactions of basis points mainly related with the share buyback of sc usa and negative impact from regulation market and exchange rate in  we could have a potential positive impact from the ph software of around basis points or slightly higher and a negative change around basis points for another regulatory impact this is our so thats the reason why we expect to finish at the end of the year around that is at the low at the top end of our target range in relation with profitability ratios remarkable that our efficiency ratio improved a little bit compared with this is again remarkable the underlying return on tangible equity recovers from the first half of the year still far away from the one we had in and the tangible net value stayed basically flat but is suffering from the continued depreciation of the currencies particularly those currencies in latin america and mainly the real the brazilian real if we go to the business activity on the group normally we dont go in that much detail with the activity but let me to guide even the current situation in which we are living let me to guide you where is the activity the average new lending is coming back to a more normalized levels in the previous quarter we have a strong government support that underpin the growth in the quarter now you see that we are lending billion a day in constant banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 euros that it was pretty much the same figure that we had back in february so some kind of a normalization in the volume of lending and compared with the previous quarter if you go into more specific details you have the mortgage and new mortgage lending by regions and this has significant recovery from the previous quarter and the consumer lending it happens pretty much the same it happens all across the regions and we saw a substantial recovery in the third quarter compared with the second quarter well in relation with smes and corporate lendings you will see that we came back after the spike in the second quarter when we were pretty active providing loans warranted by different governments to particularly to smes and corporates its coming back to a more normalized level where the government supported program is nonmaterial at the end of the quarter in september in cib large corporates after the spike that happened mainly in march the situation is back to normal and is fairly fairly stable at this point it may not surprise you everybody expect the retail sales are booming and as a result of the pandemia and the digital adoption of more and more customers by the day yeah you have figures in the screen the digital customers the digital sales are growing and the mobile is the preferred channel that the customers are using more and more and this in my view will come here to stay in the future if we analyze a little bit the details of the pl well nii was around billion no material change yearonyear net income was strongly impacted in the second mainly in the second quarter by lower transactions volumes and regulatory changes in several units from the global business point of view both wealth management insurance and cib increased fee income and represented of the total group fee income this quarter we can ph again perceive a growth of recovery of net fee income associated with normalization of activity when it come to cost i will say good developments here costs nominal costs are falling in europe around north america and south america are growing overall the group nominal costs are falling and we continue to expect positive developments in this front in relation with europe we expect to achieve the billion we established last year in april we expect to achieve at the end of this year since april till december probably were going to be there in relation with credit quality at this stage you see like two fronts one from were providing much more based on the models and the scenarios the scenarios we are using are not far away are not pneumatic but they are not far away from the ones the imf is using and as a result of these our provisions loanloss provisions are going up yearonyear and this is still the extra provisions basically remain in the balance sheet based on the models and the scenarios we are using on the other side on the credit quality side we are not seeing a significant deterioration on the credit quality so the cost of credit went up as a result of the provisions based on the scenarios and models npls ph traditional definition still performing very well loanloss service in the book in the balance sheet stood up around billion which represents of the total loan book on top of that and this is the first line of defense in this situation our preprovision profit is around billion and is fairly stable the last couple of years so finally let me to elaborate a little bit on the moratorias the payment holidays you have the figures that probably you are familiar with the total group moratoria was billion you have by products and by regions the main amount was in mortgages the twothirds of the moratoria more than twothirds is already expired and well you see behavior of those customers you have well those customers are stage stage banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 and as i already mentioned before in the stage you see by regions you have pretty much with some variations the same picture what remains and this is a behavior that well probably is better than the one we were expecting a couple of months ago and this is well you may say that the government programs protecting incomes is helping a lot in this regard the amount of loans still in moratoria is close to billion you have the split there out of this billion billion are mortgages billion consumer loans and billion smes and corporates you see where these payment holidays moratoria by countries you have two countries that are relatively small in terms of the loan book portugal and chile where the government spent moratoria for longer period of time usually one year so youre going to see these moratoria stay there and the other two is uk and spain that you see the figures compared with the loan book both in uk and spain are relatively small in the region of to of the total loan book so and this is we dont expect a behavior materially different than the ones that despite mainly taking into account that you have the figures in light blue that around in spain and in uk are secured loans to individuals so i hand it now to josé garcía cantera our cfo to elaborate about the trends in the regions and the countries and ill come back at the end to sum up and to give you our vision for thank you josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa thank you josé antonio good morning everyone despite the global nature of the pandemic our geographical and business diversification continues to work the very strong results that we had in the first quarter are predicated upon a very our diversification between the three regions and the businesses that josé antonio has commented we had positive yearonyear volume performance across all geographic regions and global businesses the decrease in the quarter is explained by the sale of puerto rico the sale of a nonperforming loan mortgage portfolio in spain i will refer to these two in a minute and also lower volumes in cib we had increase in preprovision profit in north america south america and our global businesses and the only decreases that were recorded were in europe excellent underlying profit of our global units with cib growing yearonyear and wealth management and private banking with a stable yearonyear profit but activity clearly picking up in recent months now we return to spain we have reached already million customers and we continue to support families and businesses through many initiatives for the recovery of the economy for example we have granted payment holidays in mortgages and consumer loans and we had a market share in the government support program for smes and corporates of all the while we remain prudent ensuring no deterioration in the portfolios risk profile we reached more than million digital customers with more than million accesses in the quarter leading in customer experience rankings in terms of commercial activity loans fell in the quarter due to the sale of this nonperforming loan mortgage portfolio that i mentioned that amounted to billion but obviously we had an increase yearonyear boosted by smes and corporate loans if we move to the income statement profit was higher in the quarter due to the positive performance of customer revenue in turn due to the sharp increases in net interest income up fee income up quarter onquarter on a yearonyear basis we recorded a decline in total income which was obviously the result of low interest income smaller alco portfolio the fall in net fee income due to reduced transaction volumes and also banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 lower income from our real estate subsidiaries we had a positive cost performance dropping cost down yearonyear and the nonperforming loan ratio that dropped by basis points in recent months mainly due to the sale of this nonperforming loan mortgage portfolio looking ahead we remain positive about the top line performance net interest income and net fee income are more positive towards credit quality in individuals although somewhat less so for smes given the current environment and the uncertainty if we move to santander consumer finance we continue to see strong signs of recovery in most of the countries where santander consumer finance operates while with new business its actually outperforming the market in the third quarter underlying profits increased thanks to a almost jump in net fee income which is linked to volumes returning to precrisis levels in the quarter new business volumes were at looking at nine months underlying profits continue to be heavily impacted by provisions however net interest income increased and costs were down thanks to our efficiency programs and covid19 actions implemented in the second quarter cost of credit remains low for these type of business looking forward we would expect the new business in the coming quarters at similar levels to those recorded in the third quarter with costs and loan loss provisions under control in the uk we had a strong quarterly uptick in underlying attributable profit driven by a continued increase in volumes we are actually seeing very very strong new demand for mortgages mortgage applications in recent weeks has been very strong and this should be reflected in the net interest income in coming quarters also driven by bounce back loans we reduced the costs of the account in may and in august and this can be seen in the reduced cost of funding increased fee income mainly due to cib activity costs that remain under control while loan loss provisions were significantly lower in the quarter down with the cost of credit below basis points in terms of ninemonth results continue to be impacted by covid in addition to regulatory changes affecting overdrafts although somewhat compensated by lower costs looking forward we expect to see similar trends to those that weve seen this quarter improving net interest income and continued efficiency savings with no significant changes in loan loss provisions this of course is conditioned by the brexit negotiations if we move to brazil has once again recorded an excellent quarter both in terms of results and volumes while we remain focused on capturing growth opportunities positive performance in mortgages reaching record high in new mortgage lending in the last month in the month of september in cards just in september for instance we sold cards and in wholesale banking very positive evolution also in getnet and the auto finance subsidiary underlying attributable profit rose quarteronquarter driven by consumer revenues costs were higher half of the growth in cost is explained by the collective labor agreement provisions declined in the quarter we dont foresee a worsening in the cost of credit in the coming quarters we expect it to remain stable or even improve slightly given the current economic forecasts brazil economic outlook continues to improve the imf forecasts regarding gdp growth in improved from minus in june to minus recently analyst consensus actually is even better than these expecting a drop in gdp this year between and and the current account deficit is these with all of these we would expect the brazilian real to show a better performance in the coming quarters in short brazil has again proved its balance sheet and results strength despite the current environment and we remain optimistic about the future both in terms of profits and absolute amount of profits and also in terms of profitability banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 in the united states during the quarter shusa increased its ownership stake in the consumer finance entity to and we completed the sale of the retail and commercial bank in puerto rico these sale amounts to billion in loans and billion in deposits which obviously explains why volumes show this performance however we had a strong yearonyear growth excluding these in loans and consumer loans and consumer funds boosted by corporate demand and incentive programs in the quarter profits were higher mainly due to lower provisions lower cost of debt better performance in leasing and control cost underlying attributable profit decreased yearonyear primarily due obviously to covid provisions net operating income was flat and the reduction of costs down offset total income decrease in mexico most branches the bank continue to operate normally with reduced staff and we also saw digital activity picking up substantially loan growth yearonyear was driven by the corporate side while credit cards continue to be affected by lower activity arising from lockdown measures compared to the previous quarter the profit increased slightly as lower loan provisions and higher customer revenue were offset by the fall in gains on financial transactions which were especially or exceptionally high in the second quarter ph and the rise in costs driven by several projects and higher it expense on the other hand we had good performance year onyear due to better revenue performance and improved efficiency profit was weighed down by higher loan provisions cost of credit stood around and we expect a stable or even decreasing ratio in the coming quarters these results show a very positive trend in customer revenue reflecting the improvement in our franchise and a high profitability with a return on tangible equity of lastly in the corporate center we can see the results improved compared to on the one hand we had positive impacts coming from gains from financial transactions amounting to million basically foreign currency hedging and the positive trend in operating expenses continued improving compared to last year on the other hand we had a negative impact on nii ph of the larger liquidity buffer and other results and provisions increased due to oneoff provisions for certain stakes whose values were affected by the crisis and now let me hand it back to our ceo for his closing remarks josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa a couple of minutes conclusions for results i will say strong capital build following continue organic capital generation strong operating performance taking into account the scenario increase in underlying profit in the quarter we have robust credit quality and we set a new cost of credit estimation for the full year as our chairman said in the agm with these trends and with the result we already got we expect in the whole year to be around the billion mark net profit for a very very complex year talking about the outlook for i should recognize that this is a very brave exercise given the uncertainty that is around coming from the health situation the effects on how long its going to last the covid19 we expect positive trends in revenues particularly in europe due to we expect the repricing on liabilities continue to go forward and also some help for higher lending volumes mainly the americas in in net fee income well cib and wealth management should continue to deliver relatively well in costs i already told you last quarter that we were more optimistic about our capacity to reduce costs and we are committing now an additional billion net savings reduction in the next two years in europe as a result of our one europe project thanks to the quality and diversification of our balance sheet better than expected customer behavior as i explained before and based on well the current estimations mainly coming from imf we are confident that we banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 will maintain or continue to improve the cost of credit in the pl once we use the overlays we build along the year regarding capital we are at the top end of the range in our target range and we will have more flexibility going forward in the way we match and allocate capital and the way we remunerate our shareholders ph we continue to make capital organically without sacrificing either business growth or improving of our longterm return and we expect an underlying return on equity in line with our traditional cost of equity as the chairman explained this morning in the agm we are unlocking our potential for organic growth going forward our scale creates significant opportunities for organic value creation which we realize through structural change the one santander that we are starting in europe the combination of a openbank and consumer finance and creating one of large payment platforms in the world on the back of getnet indiscernible for smes this will allow us to generate more revenues and additional cost efficiencies in summary i would say our business model diversification and the change we are doing provide a strong platform to continue to generate value for our shareholders thank you and now we remain at your disposal for the questions you may have sergio gámez martínez global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé antonio thanks josé indeed we have around half an hour minutes for qa so please indiscernible question question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen the qa session starts now operator instructions the first question comes from again from francisco riquel from alantra please go ahead francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes hello thank you for taking my questions i would like to start with asset quality if i may in particular the new cost of risk of guidance of if you can give us details of what shall we expect by for the main business areas and where the reduction comes from i understand this is mainly from brazil and scusa what will be the new cost of risk you are expecting in these two regions and what makes you more comfortable for these two units also any other relevant changes in other unit for the good or for the bad consumer finance in europe or uk mexico and then also in particular spain the transformation ratio into npls from the moratoria is the highest of all the units ph and the macro it tackles so what shall we expect in terms of cost of risk for spain for this year and next year thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay let me to take to elaborate on the asset quality the new cost of risk guidance as you rightly elaborated if we look indiscernible the quarter the main business areas that came better than expected banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 particularly was scusa in the us where the behavior both in originations and recoveries on the back of the price of the used cars in the us produced significant reduction in the net cost of risk the same happened in brazil probably you see this morning that central bank of brazil published that the number of families in default now is the lowest in the last nine years so it shouldnt surprise you that as a result of this our view about the cost of risk in brazil going forward is fairly fairly positive and i would say we remain stable or maybe may go down in the next year we as you know we build the overlay we havent used the overlay and with the current trends we are seeing we are fairly optimistic on this so other relevant changes that you mentioned you mentioned uk you mentioned mexico we dont see major change there and finally you mentioned spain where the provisions this quarter went up and well as you know we have a large sme book in spain in which we did a significant overlay but is the most sensitive area going forward sme books and well we need to be prudent on this because as i elaborate at the beginning uncertainty is still pretty high its not the same to have a pandemia that lasts for another six months than having a pandemia that lasts for nine months or one year mainly in spain where the tourist sector plays a significant role in the overall economy and while small variations in the timing of the pandemia may produce significant impacts on this but overall i feel confident with the trends in relation with the asset quality overall well you mentioned i forgot to elaborate in consumer finance in europe the behavior has been pretty pretty good yeah so im relatively confident that with this scenario we are in the scenario indiscernible the cost of risk will go down next year in the consumer finance in europe so those are the trends we are seeing across the board overall we remain constructive recognizing again the uncertainty of this scenario is pretty high sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks ph paco next question please operator thank you next question comes from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc good morning good afternoon actually its a confusing time two questions on cost and capital please on cost youve announced the billion further cost synergies can you maybe give us a bit of color of where thats coming from in terms of regions of businesses if thats going to materialize in a big charge to fund that in  maybe and related to that is your consideration is because its a very very material cost cutting exercise is that should we expect any impacts in terms of market share volumes your ability your commercial sort of reach could be affected by such as a cost cutting plan and secondly the question on capital youve had basis points regulatory impact in the quarter i think youve called out a further basis points left if i look beyond  what are the regulatory impacts that are left if we put aside basel iv and in general youve obviously accrued a dividend what gives you such a high confidence that youve proposed it to the agm ph would they approve the dividend youre i think the second bank in europe that does that how confident are you that the ssm is going to allow those dividend payments thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 let me take the first question and i will pass josé the capital one and maybe elaborate about the dividend and the ecb on the cost the billion i was referring to was billion for the project the one europe project where this cost reduction comes from is mainly from the uk and spain although we have also some cost reductions in portugal and poland but given the size of the different franchise i will think i will tell you that is more or less related with the current size of the franchise probably going to accelerate a bit more in the uk and spain that is now minus is going to be the pace of the reduction is going to be lower than the current ph and the uk having the opposite and there are some cost cutting in the portugal and poland so you raise a very good point the commercial reach and the how much this may affect our capacity to keep volumes and market share i do expect that with the current trends and the current trends are fairly fairly well established i will say so its not just the pandemia before the pandemia transactions in the branches were falling at a year digital transactions were growing at the pandemia accelerate this and on top of this when you look at sales the volume of sales to digital channels continue to increase and more and more entering to territories of high valueadded products so like the ones you have the openbank example and you look at openbank operating in pure digital mortgages you see that openbank is doing the same volume of mortgage equivalent at branches or something like that yeah so this tells you that digitalization produce a commercial reach that well given the granularity of the branches in spain the large number of branches you can create a different morphology of the branches you have so its not just the number of point of sale its the type of point of sale you have yeah so probably its less number more size per branch yeah so now josé you want to elaborate on capital josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yes alvaro some of the inspections that were scheduled for this year following covid were postponed for next year they havent started yet so we dont know for sure at this point which ones will be closed next year a conservative estimate would put the impact well below the regulatory impact that we had in so we see we continue to see our capital ratio moving at the upper end of the to range over the next months at least josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa how confident are we about the ecb or the ssm allowing to pay dividends well ph imagine our case yeah so in our case is what we are telling you right now so a strong preprovision profit that is ph on call we are not decreasing our preprovision profit that give us enough firepower as the first line of defense in order to offset potential negative outcomes coming from the credit side given the uncertainty of the scenario and this is our case and while not to subordinate bank shareholders to other shareholders of other sectors or companies asking us to keep their lending going at the cost of potential dividends for the shareholders yeah so we are making our case well base it on the what weve done since the pandemia started we increased the lending we provide liquidity all across the board we continue to generate results and based on this were asking them to allow us to pay dividends its up to them to allow us to do or not yeah sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks alvaro next question please operator the next question comes from carlos cobo from société générale please go ahead banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale hello thank you very much for the presentation one question on nii and your outlook for next year specifically spain and the uk in the uk in particular were seeing some pickup in new pricing and also lower swap costs so do you see a recovery in nii from here or should we take into account the in spain same thing but on the opposite the euribor is putting some pressure on the sector how do you see nii evolving in and thats pretty much it well maybe a quick question on mortgage formalization costs weve seen recently a new sentence in a first instance court but its kind of going following a collective lawsuit like a class action against spanish banks and they are there seems to be indiscernible for the sector do you see that as a potential risk that could increase the ph post potential provisioning needs here contrary to the previous jurisprudence where courts has been ruling on a casebycase basis thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay let me to elaborate on nii both in uk and spain as youve seen in the quarter positive developments there ph that within in the uk will be translated in the future in spain will remain also positive not as strong as in uk on the back of what you already mentioned the euribor is getting more indiscernible getting more and more into negative territory but in both case we think ph with different extensions that were going to remain in positive territory going forward what youre referring to the mortgages well i think you referred to the upfront fee we charge on the mortgages that was one case i dont see this having the capacity to progress on the upper courts and being a case ph a overall case as the others that we have seen but well again this is a fairly common practice not only in mortgages its also in consumer loans its also in lending to corporates its everywhere but well i do not expect this to come an issue for the industry sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you carlos next question please operator thank you the next question comes from fernando gil de santivanes from barclays please go ahead fernando gil de santivanes q analyst barclays capital securities ltd hi thank you for taking my questions i would like to touch a little bit on fees and what is driving the new policy in spain about fees and change what do you expect in the change of fees from november on this is the first question and the second question you mentioned that the cost restructuring is coming mainly on spain and the uk are we thinking in the uk some branch reduction only or people or what other message could be done to try to make a good guess on ph what is coming in the uk thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 okay the new policy what call new policy in spain this is a formulation what weve done is reformulation of the current strategy to have more customers indiscernible and this is a step in this direction through but the most important is ph happening on the back as you say we are betting on a significant not only in spain also across europe in a significant simplification of the product range that will allow us to have a more transparent offer at the same time to reduce costs in a significant way we dont expect a big deal in fees out of this reformulation of our current product mix its more simplification of the product range as a result of this simplification a significant cost reduction and more transparent relationship with the customer and the second question was about the details of cost in the uk so in uk well we are doing already this some of the cost till now came basically from some significant remediation process that add complexity at the corporate center ph on a quarter level like the ppis and other scheme ph to an end are coming to an end at some point weve got significant number of people thousands of people working on this and this is coming to an end and we are reducing costs there on top of this we have a restructuring of the call centers that is going on this restructuring is through incorporation of new technology the number of people working in call centers in the uk is thousands or we are introducing new technology and this allow us to simplify and to provide better service to the customer on the back of the new technology were including there the same can be applied to other indiscernible the number of branches was already indiscernible significantly its more about central services it and the way we serve customers at the corporate not exactly at the corporate center at the different corporate centers level or centers of services that we have across uk and in the case of spain nothing to add particularly on this yeah sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks fernando next question please operator the next question comes from sofie peterzéns from jpmorgan please go ahead sofie peterzéns q analyst jpmorgan yeah hi here is sofie from jpmorgan so in your presentation you mentioned that youre combining openbank with the santander consumer finance does this mean that youre going to start offering mortgages in the markets that santander consumer finance is currently present in but where openbank is not so for example scandinavia germany italy and then how should we think about these kind of merger between openbank and santander consumer finance what does it really mean for santander my second question would be around the financial transaction tax that is coming to spain from january next year what impacts if any do you expect this to have on santander and do you think there is a risk that spain could also introduce the banking tax in spain thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you sofie for your question the first question the combination of openbank consumer finance as you know consumer finance is a large consumer finance platform across europe with we are working in countries all the large countries in europe and on the other side we have a retail bank fullfledged retail bank banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 through openbank what we try to get out of this combination is santander consumer finance weve got million i should call then i shouldnt i cannot call them customers at this stage because they are basically borrowers that got along from santander through thirdparty channels with this combination we try to provide a full offer not only a long a full offer in the combination with openbank you mentioned specifically mortgages mortgages is not at this stage the main task so we continue to produce consumer loans were going to develop the point of sale the checkout lending ph and all these things at the beginning and having a retail offering to different banks we have across europe at the same time these banks we have i dont know exactly the number of bank indiscernible we have in europe but were going to reduce significantly and were going to operate through a limited number of banks probably three is not yet established and the others will be branches of those banks with the technology of openbank and with the capabilities through thirdparty channels of consumer finance i think this combination is powerful will allow us to grow significantly the business and transform many of these i called before borrowers into customers of the new entity you mentioned the financial transaction tax impact on santander none or marginal were going to pass to the customers naturally its true that the volumes may get reduced and this may affect fees on brokerage but those are so small that in any case its immaterial in terms of the pl yeah sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks sofie next question please operator thank you the next question comes from jernej omahen from goldman sachs please go ahead jernej omahen q analyst goldman sachs international yeah good afternoon from my side as well i just have two questions please the first one is the followon on the dividend and id like to understand better or if you could share with us rather how does the process works currently between a bank like santander and the ssm the supervisor i struggle to imagine that santander with a dividend proposal on the agm and made it public as a consequence without at least telling a very extensive discussion with the supervisor whether thats appropriate and all i would like your comment on that and then the second question on the process is when are you actually expecting to hear from the ssm on the decision on the dividend and just a followup josé antonio you talked about how santander made the case to the ssm for dividend approval and you referenced strong preprovision profit increased lending and generated results and i think everybody on this call agrees with this but i guess that the key feature of the ssm then was that it didnt discriminate amongst banks and it doesnt discriminate amongst banks regardless of their operating and financial strength implied in your answer i think is a notion that this will change so are you expecting the ssm to start differentiating amongst banks that can and cant distribute in the future thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you jernej you asked me how the process work with the ssm well we have our responsibilities and the ssm has they have their own responsibilities and what based what weve done this morning in our agm was based on the current result generation and our expectation for the future we put for approval at the shareholders meeting a cash dividend for next year this is our assessment of the situation yeah banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 so what do we expect from the ssm the ssm is going to do the analysis on the what i dont know if this is already established but like what i heard is theyre going to have some outcome by december this year yeah so theyre going to say something in december the recommendation or no recommendation or as you say they are they may be worried about discriminating between banks and well im not in a position to elaborate about their thinking we make our case we think our case is strong on the basis of this we proposed this to the shareholders yeah so its what i can tell you at this stage is no more no less than we are responsible on behalf of our shareholders and also we need to take naturally of bank holders and the clients and the customers and all of these things but the numbers support our claim and this is what we think and what we expect to be recognized by the ssm at the appropriate time and this my expectation will be by december yeah josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa also if i may just remember that our minimum capital requirement is now so at fully loaded we have basis points of capital and in the worst crisis that weve heard in decades the bank is generating capital so even before or even after accruing for the dividend the capital ratio is going up we are not leaving any requests from any client without being attended so i think its all of these its a strong case to allow bank santander to pay dividends going forward sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you next question please operator the next question comes from ignacio ulargui from exane bnp please go ahead ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas sa yeah hi good afternoon thanks for the presentations and for taking my questions i have two questions one is what do we expect in terms of recurring revenue growth in latam and you have commented a lot about uk and spain how do you see latam in terms of consumer volumes have we seen a recovery so a bit of outlook on fees and nii in brazil mexico mainly to be honest and the second one its on the restructuring charges that are associated to the billion of cost savings and then did you plan sort of like a similar level to the ones that you took in for the previous billion around million or how do we expect them to happen and just a very quick one what is the level of cost of equity that you have in mind historically the bank has had to an annualize level thanks josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay the first question ignacio your question was about revenue growth in latam so we see we continue to see indiscernible local currencies yeah so the exchange rate comes on top of this yeah in local currency i expect the volume growth to be significant ph growth in the numbers in brazil our volume growth is significant also same growth mexico although the economic situation going on in mexico is significantly worse than it is in brazil but positive volume growth will translate in this into higher revenue banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 basically i do expect some negatives coming from what happened this year with the special check in brazil where the regulator particularly in the payments space may act in some direction so overall im positive in growing revenues there but probably were going to grow much faster revenue sorry volumes than nii on the back of probably some margin compression and regulators stepping in some areas particularly related probably with fee income maybe also with some pricing like they did in brazil at the beginning of this year restructuring charge well we have we dont take this for granted we need to go into a process with establish all the negotiation what i could have in mind is a payback of to years in the restructuring cost in relation with the cost reduction the cost of equity i were referring in our annual report we present every year and i dont know how its called ph irp i dont know how do you call it every year we publish our cost of equity there and you take the last couple of years if i remember was the lowest has been in the 8something percent and the highest has been in the 9something percent yeah yeah so this is the range we have had and this is the take this as a range to use when were referring to the cost of equity naturally its not the case right now yeah but now there is a significant ph reduction going on at the start of these metrics yeah sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks ignacio next question please operator thank you the next question comes from adrian cighi from credit suisse please go ahead adrian cighi q analyst credit suisse hi there thank you very much two followup questions please one on the outlook you now expect the underlying rote to be inline with your cost of equity which you just defined as to range current consensus is expecting an rote of less than despite already incorporating a cost of risk of around basis points which is in line with your guidance can you maybe help us bridge the gap just on broad strokes and the second one is on inorganic growth the santander chairman supports consolidation but remains reluctant to be a part of it at the moment what catalyst would be necessary for santander to be involved in ma in europe or the us thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa well in your first question well its probably you have your expectations probably if the cost of risk is pretty much the same probably we our view about revenues is more optimistic than yours yeah so its the only way on costs so we continue to expect cost reductions in europe i already mentioned this i already elaborate on this on the other side i also elaborate on looking seeing the nii both in uk and spain stay in the positive territory and the fee income naturally with all the caveats about the uncertainty related with the covid being also positive so we expect positive revenue costcutting negative nominal costs and this should translate into a relatively or healthy pl compared with the oneoff this year yeah so this is my view at this stage banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 when youre referring to an organic growth well ma in us and europe okay so weve been reluctant because this stage we struggle to relay equity story that works yeah so in which we are able to secure properly in the middle of this scenario now we are concentrated in margin what we have in front of us and we dont need to get too complicated in our and to devote our management capabilities to other things and the ones we are currently managing and this is the main reason yeah so not other than this one and because traditionally we did plenty of inorganic growth on the back of getting the scale yeah and well we already got the scale in the majority of the markets almost all the markets in which we are in and well when people ask me why not go in spain with or around market share i dont need to scale and this happens in the majority of the markets in which were working and we are much more focused in the internal transformation with the projects we mentioned and the chairman mentioned in the yearend the one europe project the combination of consumer finance and openbank and finally to build the payment platforms across the group both for acquiring business and sme trade regulated business yeah so this is the main focus were going to work on this on top of managing the current business in a highly uncertain environment that require all our attention yeah sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks adrian now time for the last question please operator the next question comes from stefan nedialkov from citigroup please go ahead stefan r nedialkov q analyst citigroup global markets ltd hi good afternoon guys just wanted to probe a little bit the guidance so when the pandemic started back in march you came up with some guidance in terms of expected impact for and in retrospect that ended up being quite optimistic obviously its been very uncertain times but what makes you more confident this time around in giving guidance which is substantially above consensus as adrian noted and related to that when we looked at your stage break down for loans that are under moratoria versus those that are not it looks like the stage ratio was around versus for the group as a total can you just give us some color on how youre thinking about the potential transition from stage into stage of the moratoria along next year thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay the first question is a very fair one given the uncertainty of the macro scenario in which we are living so at the beginning of this pandemia nobody was expecting what has already happened maybe what is still in front of us but what make us but with you asking us about guidance we gave out you first any scenario that this next are very much in line with how you ph manage a scenario and second we already seen the reaction of the different actors in this crisis we saw the reaction of the central banks the central bank reacted in some cases reducing flushing dramatically rates in us in uk in brazil as in other markets and this has an impact at the same time they provide liquidity they provide their tltro iii and we saw the reaction of the central banks stabilizing the markets and theyre going to continue to do so based on what they are telling us on a almost on a daily basis so this is one side banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 on the other side the governments are stepping in two directions one direction was to provide warrantees for lending to the smes and corporates for example in some countries this is very important in spain we got we grew lending and weve got billion of warrantees for the smes and corporate book now billion is warranted by the government and the government showed its willingness to continue to support economic activity with new lines for investments so this is we already know this we didnt know it before and looking forward my expectation and its only my expectation is indiscernible i do expect based that once the pandemia lets call it comes to an end and coming to an end means that we have an effective treatment or a ph vaccine or a combination of both i do expect the governments to keep these schemes going for a while till the economy start to recover we may be wrong naturally on this i mentioned a couple of times uncertainty uncertainty is the word probably i repeat the most in this scenario but we tell you our views and based on what views we are building our impressions about the future and the trends about the future when you mentioned the stage and stage well let me to remember on the moratoria we have kind of two behind the moratoria we have kind of two different type of customers the ones who are taking a financial advantage because in some moratoria they indiscernible financial advantage for the customer and some customers took it so this means that it costs us money in our pl because we are in some cases lending money for free they took this some of our customers that they took because they fear about the future or they worry about the situation having more than twothirds of the moratoria expired and i show you the behavior and the remaining moratoria is still there the majority is secure lending keep in mind that for example in spain people in mortgages its much much cheaper to pay the mortgage than to rent a house yeah so but its not cheaper maybe cheaper or cheaper so i do not expect a significant deterioration on mortgages and as you show in the presentation the overwhelming majority of the moratoria stays in mortgages naturally we are having significant rating migration in our portfolio when we analyze this and as a result of this risk weighted taxes grew in the region of billion billion that means that probably we are downgrading billion billion of the loan book to different ratings probably in the corporate large corporate sector and this is going from one stage to another and this is a process that will continue based on our future expectations but im not at this stage particularly worried about moratoria maybe i need to make a caveat in sc usa what i mentioned at the beginning i think it was in the first or second question one of your colleagues make that the behavior in sc usa in the auto market in us is extremely good much better than the one we were expecting particularly on the back of the price of used cars in the us that currently is still is above of the prices of last year and this reduced dramatically the loss given the fall in this business and i dont know to be honest with you how long it will last this for this year our projection is more or less optimistic than the current situation but it is what it is but there are naturally significant levels of uncertainty around all our forecasting particularly on the cost of risk front yeah also maybe that while we may face more severe pandemia and we have another lockdown like the ones we had back in the spring that we are not forecasting we are somehow if you allow me to say we are forecasting kind of current situation till the spring and having some remedies after that yeah so there may be treatment ph vaccine or less incidents of the covid but i agree with you that what we are in uncharted territory yeah and im not particularly wellequipped to forecast a health issues yeah banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2020 sergio gámez martínez global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa okay im afraid we need to indiscernible everyone josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer
