every quarter our group ceo will address in detail the first half highlights as well as the group performance then our group cfo will talk about the different business areas reviews and obviously the group ceo will go into the key takeaways before jumping straight into the qa the conference call should take us around hour and now josé antonio the floor is yours josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay good morning to everyone thank you for attending this second quarter results presentation so as you have well known the quarter has been a very challenging the environment was significantly deteriorated by the pandemia and in this environment this difficult environment the bank has delivered a solid operating performance despite the economic environment so during the second quarter we were able to continue the performance trend set during the previous quarters in activity and underlying results in terms of activity the bank has extended substantial financial support to its customers to help them through the pandemic stock continued to grow in our two regions and our digital adoption has accelerated a lot we are starting to see signs of normalization in retail new lending particularly in europe with mortgage and consumer and new business increasing smes and corporates were supported by the existing government guarantee programs cib reduced from the peak in april i will talk more indepth about the different segments of the activity the strong top line performance given the current market context with a net operating income increase of driven by resilient customer revenue and our cost reduction plan minus yearonyear in real terms the cost reductions are ahead of plan driven by successful spends margin in the last few years and additional savings measures adopted since the beginning of the crisis higher loanloss provisions based on the application of indiscernible we outlined to you in the previous quarter the total loanloss provisions are billion in the first half of the year and underlying profit of billion in the quarter billion in the first half however as a result of the pandemic the bank has completed a review of the valuation of the bank goodwill held against past acquisitions and of the tax credits carryforward we recorded a noncash nonrecurring impairment charge of billion resulting in an statutory attributable loss for the first half of billion i will explain in the details later additionally we have strengthened the balance sheet we maintained the estimation of the cost of credit that we gave to you in first q expecting to reach at yearend with very good credit quality supported by mitigation measures that weve been taking furthermore we reinforced our capital position in the quarter delivered on a strong organic capital generation of basis points in the quarter with group cet1 reaching at the top end of the banks target after the accrual of basis points of core equity tier capital in the quarter to allow the flexibility to pay a cash dividend from earnings banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 in addition the boards intention is to propose to shareholders the payment of a scrip dividend ph payable in shares in as soon as possible depending on the macro and the regulatory requirements the intention of the board is to go to cash dividend as i said as soon as possible going to the pl so we deliver a strong performance exchange rates has had a significant impact percentage points in revenues and percentage point in cost resilient customer revenue even with lower business activity a strong performance on cib space that is reflected in other income we accelerate our cost reduction and higher loanloss provisions due to covid19related provisions in  these were within the provision overlay which we included in the net capital gains and provisions but have now been allocated by country in this line you have the details in the appendix as a result second quarter underlying attributable profit of million driven first half results of billion after absorbing billion of loanloss provision we have also recorded nonrecurring charges which i am going to explain and break down in the following slide every year usually in the  group evaluates whether the adjustment of the goodwill generated in the acquisition of the subsidiaries is necessary in the quarter following the trigger events occurring requiring an earlier review this is a very special economic situation the changes in the economic environment has been very very very very high we expect gdp to contract in all the countries in which we operate and anticipate a two threeyear recovery period at the same time we have lowerforlonger interest rates with significant decreases in many jurisdictions and we also increased the discount rates to reflect the market volatility and higher risk premiums when we discounted the future cash flows so the analysis of ph valueinduced guidance and its comparison with the group value results in a total goodwill impairment of billion of which billion is the result of a percentage point increase in the discount rate by country you can see indiscernible slide santander uk billion us billion poland billion and consumer finance million some in nordic some in germany additionally the economic environment also affect our capacity to use the tax credits carryforward in the short run especially those that are registered in spain the spanish consolidated fiscal group as a result we also recorded a billion impairment to deferred tax assets the impairments as you know are noncash items have no impact on our market position and credit risk position and are neutral in cet1 capital nevertheless we remain optimistic that the growth potential in the markets in which we operate and this impairment does not reflect in any case the importance of the markets in which we operate and how core are for us going for capital we continue to build capital in the quarter we generate basis points organic capital in the quarter due to higher net profit management of risk weighted assets and increased securitizations this together with the positive regulatory impact driven by the expected european regulation of capital requirements crr2 quick fix measures led to a total increase of basis points on the other hand there were several nonrecurring impacts in the quarter such as ebury acquisition and negative impacts coming from fx mainly and some from pensions all of this results in a cet1 of and the management buffer of circa basis points versus basis points precovid19 today we have a greater visibility than a few months ago we ph do not believe that were going to destroy capital conversely we think its more feasible to pay dividends so we banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 have it included in this capital position the sale of puerto rico not the sale of puerto rico no the potential impact of the software deduction that may come indiscernible that will be in the region of north of basis points impact so going to the activity let me to guide you through the activity in the quarter first on the operational side the bank has operated remarkably well in all the geographic areas the business continuity was not compromised and we havent had any relevant incident at the same we continue to serve our customers with the attention they deserve currently nearly of our branches are open we strengthened our corporate centers capabilities and we are over atms indiscernible the group working as usual as our point of sale turnover has recovering near to precrisis levels following turnover growth from the low reached in april also we started to gradually return to our usual workplace in some countries at the end of may always following the recommendation of the local government respecting the individuals needs of each employee when it comes to the financial activity you have on the screen the retail new lending while we are seeing some signs of normalization particularly ph intense in europe also in the us less intense in latin america in europe as you can see mortgage lending new business is recovering particularly in uk and spain north america and south america are below precrisis levels with south america more affected as some restrictions still apply in consumer lending recovering quickly in all the european countries with nordics above ph precovid activity and germany negative and the spain and italy over we had strong origination volumes in the us particularly in prime boosted by ph fca company in south america volumes is still below precovid despite having spike in april when we go to the corporate and cib lending let me to remember that this has been a quarter in which weve been using the credit facilities through the government guarantee programs over operations have been formalized amounting for more than million mainly in spain also in uk and some in the us in lending to smes and corporates in europe growth was driven mainly by spain in large part due to ico loans and also in the uk bounce back loans and cbils north america group volumes returning to precovid level south america it is still an earlier phase of the crisis and continue to have mixed performance across countries brazil declining month to month while chile and argentina having some growth in cib credit growth of billion since february such in dropdowns across countries in march and first weeks of april ph who thought normalizing in the later half of the quarter much of this liquidity has been placed directly in deposits that grew billion in the quarter so if we go for the geographic areas you can see the activity in june group new lending was similar to pre covid levels in the second quarter stock continued to grow in our ph key regions resulting in a yearonyear increase in loans and growth in customer funds the stock you have the stock there basically retail loans remained fairly stable while corporate and wholesale balance increase across the board finally as a result of the health crisis digital adoption has accelerated a lot our digital products and services are becoming more important than ever we have increased million mobile customers since growing and we reached million digital customers in first half we grew more than in first half of banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 our digital sales penetration increased to in  versus in of note it was santander uk with an exceptional of digital sales of the total in  in the first half of as a result we have again achieved record quarterly figures in the number of digital ph services and transactions going to the group earnings let me just start with revenue i will qualify the revenue as i did at the beginning very resilient with significant growth in the americas north americas still growing and europe some decrease mainly due to the fee income line as a result of lower activity well overall as i said at the beginning very resilient revenue as the result of our business model that is characterized by strong relationship with our customers you go to different parts of the revenue lines different revenue lines nii was billion basically flat compared with the previous year so although internally we have significant changes better higher volumes the impact of the lower interest rates some regulatory impact particularly in brazil with overdrafts and the very high liquidity buffer the highest ever that has implications in the cost but overall flat nii in constant currency going to the fee income we have like the three walls here the retail banking that suffer naturally the lack of activity in the quarter the lower volumes of transactions mainly in europe and regulatory changes in several units the americas remained broadly stable from the business point of view of note is wealth management insurance cib increased fees and represent of the group fees this quarter we can perceive a gradual recovery in net fee income associated with normalization of the activity in retail pointofsale and card turnover increased and between april and june after the sharp plunge of yearonyear indiscernible in wealth management insurance volume show positive yearonyear growth in santander asset management driven by market movements and positive net sales in may and june in insurance new production has started to recover precrisis levels in the second quarter mainly in latin america in cib the valuation has been very good up the fee income driven by global transaction banking global debt financing and the global markets our strategy remain focused on increasing loyalty and growing higher valueadded products and services and we are more optimistic for the coming quarters costs as i mentioned at the beginning lower in real terms reflecting our successful management in this space we are accelerating the cost reduction trends in most markets notably in spain minus uk minus and us minus this allow us to be ahead of schedule in our cost reduction plan and ph recapture incremental cost efficiency we have already achieved efficiencies in europe over million year todate we represent of the initial full year target the efficiency ratio remained broadly in line with the previous year at that is remarkable in this environment and we believe that the management that we plan to do by region and the ph lessons learned from the management of the pandemic will enable us to accelerate our transformation plan in the future and consequently further optimize costs while improving customer experience we are optimistic about the cost evolution in the coming quarters so ph going to credit quality we recorded a loanloss provisions as i mentioned before of billion billion first quarter billion second quarter as a result we still expect the cost of risk of the group to be in the region of as we had already mentioned so the traditional measures of credit quality at this stage do not apply that much npl remained fairly flat so all these provisions are based on the models plus applying the scenarios to the model as you know banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 having said that let me to give you some color about whats going on in our loan book as we mentioned in the previous quarter payment holidays have been the amount of customers affected that got a payment holidays has been significant more than million customers got some kind of moratoria for a total amount of billion close to of this amount is granted to individuals of which around is secure lending the vast majority is mortgage related and it represents and is more concentrated in our highly collateralized uk portfolio moreover as are legislative moratoria a large majority of the customers in the uk have requested the payment holiday as a way to benefit from favorable financial conditions indeed circa of these customers do not have any arrears on record consumer accounts for of the moratoria of which indiscernible is auto loans such a moratoria is shortened typically two or three month and this is starting to expire and i will provide you some data ph immediately just of the sme and corporate portfolio is under moratoria and these complemented with new liquidity facilities backed by government guarantees by more than billion as i mentioned before in summary according to our internal risk analysis of the portfolio subject to moratoria is defined as a low risk although its still early given the uncertainty levels to draw final conditions let me to share with you whats going on with this portfolio as well as the current moratoria expired as you can indiscernible close to of the moratoria will mature in of which had already expired as of 30th of june and more will do so in the next three months although its still too early to draw any conclusions in expired volumes we can see that the current expirations are behaving with no material deviation from their normal behaviors of the total expired at 30th of june circa billion remains performing more than are residential mortgage mainly concentrated in the uk billion is consumer of which billion is auto mainly in scusa concerning smes corporates as of june the expired loans are concentrated mainly in brazil we are reinforcing local recoveries teams these moratoria and the early performance of expired payment holidays were taken into account when calculated the estimated cost of credit indiscernible of basis points basis points as of 15th of july more than million of these loans had expired maintaining similar credit quality and only of the total had entered into stage so maybe to handle now to jose that hes going to elaborate to different business areas regions and business areas in the quarter josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa thank you josé antonio and good morning everyone as previously mentioned group net operating income was again supported by the banks geographic and business diversification north and south america grew their operating income while the performance of europe was impacted by the economic environment showing the different stages in the evolution of the pandemic we had an outstanding performance in our global businesses both in net operating income and profit enhancing our local scale with global reach as mentioned our corporate investment bank grew profits by achieving doubledigit growth in all of its main businesses but particularly in global markets and global debt financing also wealth management insurance expanded its profits based on sound revenue and flat costs banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 now moving on to the countries lets start with spain in the period heavily impacted by the state of alarm we led in amongst spanish banks the response to the economic crisis it is worth mentioning the implementation of ph plan de ayuda help plan or aid plan to protect our most vulnerable customers with more than joining the mortgage consumer and car payment holiday measures from the outset weve been the most proactive bank in ico funding and thanks to process automatization we granted billion of ico loans in over operations which represents a market share of customer funds were lower yearonyear impacted by the fall in time deposits and mutual funds may lead you to markets performance however customer deposits grew in the quarter underlying attributable profit amounted to million in the quarter down yearonyear obviously driven by higher provisions in addition total income decreased due to lower net interest income basically lower rates indiscernible explain the majority of this drop and also lower net fee income due to reduced transaction volumes these impacts were partially offset by doubledigit cost reduction as a result of the optimization processes carried out looking forward we would expect to see improved trend in net interest income boosted by higher volumes as it was the case quarteronquarter and also we will see further cost reduction santander consumer finance we are starting to see strong signs of recovery in most of the markets where it operates new car sales in europe dropped almost in the first half while new lending in santander consumer finance fell by less than half due to the strong performance in january and february the largest falls in the business were in southern europe while northern europe less affected by the lockdown held up better as the ceo already explained new businesses have bounced back considerably in recent weeks approaching precrisis levels in many markets or even exceeding as it is the case in the nordics net interest income increased driven by strong loan growth yearonyear particularly in northern europe however net fee income which is directly related to the fall in new car sales decreased costs were down yearonyear quarteron quarter due to the efficiency programs that we had launched already before the covid loan loss provisions increased to historically high levels but the cost of credit the cost of risk remains at low level for this type of business as a result underlying profits fell although rebounded in the quarter in the uk volumes continued to grow healthily loans rose yearonyear underlying attributable profit continued to be impacted by revenue pressures net interest income affected by that base rate reduction and the svr and net fee income affected by lower transactionality and regulatory changes to overdrafts there was also unexpected significant impact on loan loss provisions we have reason to expect however an improvement for the rest of the year we have reduced the rates on the 1i2i3 world accounts in may and we have announced a further reduction in august additionally funding from the bank of englands term funding scheme has significantly reduced funding cost both of these will support net interest income over the rest of the year moreover our transformation program is driving the yearonyear drop ph in cost in real terms our credit quality remains strong related to payment holidays that had been granted as previously mentioned the majority are mortgages with very high quality borrowers who have requested a holiday due to its favorable financial conditions looking forward we believe that we have weathered the worst of the crisis and expect an upward trend in the coming quarters the uk remains a core strategic market for the group banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 brazil has again proved its balance sheet strength and successful business model which enabled us to maintain high returns for our shareholders return on tangible equity was additionally we continued to focus on improving our service quality and this was reflected in a substantial increase in nps to record levels lending increased yearonyear with all segments growing customer funds also rose boosted by demand and time deposits net operating income rose backed by positive performance of revenues and efforts to reduce cost net interesting come increased slightly driven by larger volumes which offset margin pressures due to the change in mix interest rate cuts and change of the cheque especial terms a regulatory change while net interest income was impacted by the slowdown in activity costs were lower excluding inflation with improved efficiency yearonyear basis points down the group net operating income was not reflected in underlying attributable profit because obviously higher provisions which also led to an increase in cost of credit but within our expectations in short the bank continues its excellent performance even in a more difficult environment during the pandemic santander us has remained focused on supporting its customers employees and communities while pursuing its strategic priorities in the bank in sbna we continued our digital and branch transformation while enhancing our auto finance partnership with santander consumer focused on prime loans in santander consumer we had disciplined originations through our dealer network enhancing our partnership with fiat chrysler and sbna and the bank loans were boosted by the paycheck protection program in santander consumer originations declined in march and april but have recovered later in the quarter driven by fca initiative programs underlying attributable profit decreased yearonyear due primary to provisions which increased almost compared to the previous year underlying attributable profit was times indiscernible higher due to lower costs loan loss provisions and reduced minority interest in summary we had a solid volume growth in the quarter and in previous quarters weve doubled profits in the last two years and we have strengthened our capital position as shown in the stress test this is the result of the continuous improvement in our franchise and we believe we can continue to grow and add value in a key market for us in mexico the bank continued with its debtor support program ph aid individuals and smes in addition a significant number of branches operated with reduced staff digital channels and contact centers worked normally digital activity increased substantially yearonyear with a increase in mobile customers in transactions and digital sales penetration is now percentage points higher than in the first half of loan growth was driven by corporates cib and mortgages quarteronquarter obviously it was impacted by the slowdown in the use of credit lines from corporates and cib following the strong growth that we had in the month of march net operating income increased yearoveryear supported by positive revenue performance and improved efficiency costs show a better trend than in previous quarters and the efficiency ratio improved by more than percentage points underlying attributable profit rose yearonyear which benefited which benefited from reduced noncontrolling interests in short very positive trend reflecting the improvement of our franchise in recent years and finally in the corporate center the first thing that i wanted to say is that it continues to play a critical role in supporting the group through the special situation committees also starting in may the progressive reincorporation of employees to the workplace began with a mixture of onsite and remote working always following government and health authority recommendations maintaining a high level of flexibility to meet individual needs banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 with regard to results underlying attributable loss is flat compared to mainly due to the combination of on the one hand the positive impact of the foreign currency hedging which is reflected in financial transactions of million and a reduction in costs on the other hand net interest income was negatively affected by larger liquidity buffer where the revaluation of some small stakes is reflected in provisions and now i will hand it back to josé antonio for his concluding remarks thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you josé let me to conclude and go back to the questions you may have so the second quarter as i said at the very beginning continue to we operate under specific conditions that were not the best to deliver in terms of our business having said that as i mentioned at the beginning operationally we served very well i would say our customers and we were able to keep the business going so as a result of this situation the management of the situation we mentioned already we continue with strong capital we generate significant capital in the quarter organic capital generation and we maintained our core target in the top of our range as i mentioned before and given the strength of the banks capital underlying performance the bank has accrued basis points of cet1 capital in  allowing the option to pay dividend from earnings on top of that we have an intention to pay a scrip dividend payable in shares before the yearend and coming back to cash dividend when this is feasible from the macro point of view and from the regulatory point of view we delivered strong performance from preprovision profits resilient income and cost reduction accelerating in second half of this year we expect to recover our customer revenue via nii and fees and to continue to delivering on our cost reduction ahead of our plans we have good credit quality so we maintain the cost of credit after the some of the customers the moratoria expired and we shared with you the data this continue to be consistent with our expectation of cost of risk for this year in summary i would say our business models strength and execution of our strategy continue to show resilience across different cycles this is helped by the groups strong preprovision profit the amount of credit ph we service for billion and the fact in all the stress test capital destroyed is significantly lower than our competitors this makes us confident of our future performance and our ability to continue to generate capital finally accelerating our transformation plans are key for this reason we accelerate in our transformation plans to leverage both our scale and the collective strength on our regions and global businesses are focusing on simplifying our operational improving customer experience to grow profitability and with improved efficiency have learned from customer behavior changes during the pandemic and from our own operational experience im convinced that all of this will enable us to work more efficiently which combined with greater integration should be reflected in an increase to our profitability all these elements make our net operating income forecasts consistent with our ph investorgrade mediumterm targets thats all on our side and now we have time for questions sergio take the lead banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 sergio gámez toro global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé antonio thanks josé indeed we have now time for qa so please lets proceed with the session first question question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen the qa session starts now operator instructions thank you the first question comes from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc good morning thanks for taking my questions just one on the dividend and another one on impairments on the dividend just the mandatory scrip just the rationale behind it given it has no impact on valuation and given its certainly affecting the perception among institutional investors whats the rationale behind it and youve also pointed out that youre going to move in cash dividend just wanted to discuss if you can discuss the visibility obviously on the macro we understand visibility is what it is but im more asking about regulatory headwinds the ecb announced that trim exercises are back live now so how comfortable are you that the visibility is better from a regulatory perspective and given you were going to move in cash last year and so what makes you more comfortable there and the second question on impairments i dont know if you can maybe after the call share some of the assumptions behind the impairments on the dtas and goodwill impairments and will that are you comfortable now that we should not have any further impacts on tangible value going forward from extraordinary ones of course thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay alvaro thank you for your question the first one is the rationale behind the mandatory scrip so you say as you know our shareholder base north of on the shareholder base are retail shareholders and theyve been quite vocal on this asking us for keeping some kind of remuneration in scrip thats the main rationale i know that the share count goes up and this is probably something that may not please some institutional investors but we need to take into account all our shareholder base institutionals and retail shareholders so the second question regulatory well we also want to stress to you and to state to you that the boards intention is to go back to cash dividend as soon to cash dividend as soon as we can ph and this line we accrued basis points roughly speaking million as the intention is the profit generation goes accordingly with our expectations to keep accruing dividend in the coming quarters and we think that the ecb regulatory the ecb position on this as cannot be our way is going to be regulated with the capacity of banks to keep generating profits along this cycle as long as we are forecasting a recurring capacity to generate profits we accrue dividend that shows the board intention to pay dividend in cash and we continue to generate profits naturally there are two uncertainties here one is on the macro side if we are on the macro and the profits are not the ones we expected it may happen we are not in this line we think that were going to keep generating profit recurring profits and the second one is banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 the recommendations from the regulator that it may be will depend more on the capacity of the banks not to destroy capital during the crisis the impairment assumptions for the impairment so basically the impairment i mentioned three factors behind these the first one and the most important one is the macro situation that deteriorates significantly the profits in the very short run not in the medium term this is more in the short run as you have seen this quarter were reporting a significant low profits i mean underlying profits than the ones we were reporting one year ago as a result of the health crisis this is going to affect for two years three years as i mentioned before and this has an impact the reaction of the central banks to this situation in many jurisdictions has been to reduce rates particularly in us and uk where this has some effect the first part the health crisis theyre relating to higher loan loss provisions the second part put pressure on nii and finally we increased the discount rate on average not in all jurisdictions its the same but take the as a round number more in some jurisdictions less in others as a result of the higher market volatility and as a result higher risk premiums and this has an impact of i mentioned i think i mentioned in the presentation of billion out of the billion billion is due to the higher discount rate and billion coming from the other two factors i mentioned sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you alvaro next question please next question operator the next question comes from ignacio ulargui from exane please go ahead ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas thanks thanks for taking my question the first i have one question only if you could elaborate a bit on what is the outlook for preprovisioning profit at a group level into the second half with the different moving parts from revenues and costs and whether that number is really the information that we have today at the bottom of josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay im not sure we elaborate a bit about this that we are expecting a well a lot of this depends naturally on the but the scenario in which we are working is having somehow new normality what is called new normality somehow in europe and in us with some still a activity that is at the current levels not back because probably this is not going to be possible till we get an efficient treatment for the covid or a vaccine being widely spread so we are working with a scenario close to the one we have today in europe and us and latin america coming back to certain normality in the next two months so this is scenario with which we are working in this scenario we should be able to recover our nii as we mentioned im fairly positive on nii we are re pricing liabilities in many of jurisdictions particularly in terms as josé mentioned in the uk as you know jurisdictions and nii should have certain strength in the second quarter and to recover something that will last as a result of the lockdown particularly in europe i showed you the numbers and the effect on fee income was due to significantly lower activity during the lockdown banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 as long as we dont have lockdowns and this is the hypothesis im making we should have a stronger pre provision profit in the second half of the year than the one weve had in the first half of the year and i do not see in this scenario again uncertainty in the scenarios is that higher provisions than the one we recorded in the first half of the year so thats my assumption for the rest of the year ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas thanks ignacio next question please operator the next question comes from fernando gil from barclays please go ahead fernando gil de santivanes q analyst barclays capital securities ltd hi good morning thank you for taking my questions two questions from my side first is can you please remind those the book value of the uk and us after these goodwills impairments this is one second is can you please refresh the ph assets changed sensitivity going forward in the pl thanks josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa so do you have the figures for uk and us remember its billion josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa billion uk josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa billion uk its in our quarterly report like i am speaking by memory billion uk sergio you remember the new number for us we come back to you and give you the exact figure but this is published in our annual report you have there the book value on the goodwills the goodwill at the group level was billion after this impairment its going to go to the billion concentrated mainly and speaking by memory in brazil mexico and very little in uk after this impairment very little in us so this is i think alvaro your colleague asked me in the first question i didnt address this the further impacts of the impairments in tnav no i do not see any further impairments that affect tnav tnav i do not see further impairments impact when ph we do impairment tests only when it comes negative ph you record it in many cases its positive and when we compare the ph discount cuts future expected cash flows with the current market value fx impact josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa as you know we have a policy of hedging tactically the pl it is hedged for the rest of the year mostly almost all currencies are hedged for the rest of the year and we have started already to hedging some of the position for banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 next year particularly the us dollar to mexican peso and the brazilian real its not fully hedged next year but we have started to do it josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa but let me to elaborate on this well the fx this first half of the year impact has been intense the depreciation of emerging markets currency indiscernible significant across the board in general the euro strength is there and what we expect going forward is after this depreciation not having additional significant depreciation impact other than the one that may come from maybe high inflation countries in our case its basically argentina but i could be more constructive on fx in mexico and brazil that are the two most important countries given the fact that they think the markets are taking overly negative view over the developments in those countries and as you can see in our figures we are seeing the activity and the levels of activity and the capacity to generate profits in those markets continues to be relatively strong and this means that economies handling the crisis better than i think many market participants are thinking yeah sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa just as a follow up if i may carrying value from the uk is billion billion scusa and billion sbna and out of the post impairment billion goodwill for the entire group brazil represents around billion but obviously im happy to catch up in more detail about the numbers after the call next question please operator the next question comes from andrea filtri from mediobanca please go ahead andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom good morning thank you for taking my question could you please update us on ifrs charges where are you on those and what macro scenario youre reflecting now are you envisaging further covid charges in h2 what sort of capital headwinds do you envisage from risk weighted asset procyclicality as macro deteriorates in the coming quarters and are there any pending trim impacts left at this stage you said that you confirmed the to cost of risk guidance reflecting the benefits of the moratoria what would this be without that and just finally what is the tltro iii benefit to come i guess from  onwards thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay plenty of questions andrea im going to address some of them others if i could pass to josé ifrs charge is what is reflected in our loan loss provision we are working with naturally with our models in the scenario that i mentioned we havent changed the scenario its the one i mentioned in the previous quarter that is not exactly but very much in line with what imf scenario was at this time we havent changed this so do we expect further covidrelated provisions unless we have a different scenario going forward i do not expect additional that are already embedded in our numbers the second question is risk weighted asset procyclicality indiscernible procyclicality already happening so we are this rate immigration and we are already including we have some rate immigration particularly or in some cases significant rate immigration particularly in the cib space it happens on a continuous banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 basis and its going to be reflected quarterafterquarter yeah so including the second quarter where the pro cyclicality was significant and is included in our organic capital generation okay the trim impacts josé maybe you want to take this one the moratoria as i mentioned does not help in the cost of risk and so the cost of risk at this stage comes from the application of scenarios to the models if we were recording costs of risk based on observation like it was in the past the cost of risk of would be significantly lower we take into account naturally all the moratorias what is going on with the moratorias because well naturally this is but the majority of the cost of risk comes from the extra cost of risk comes from the models would you want to elaborate in trim impact indiscernible tltro iii josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa yeah with regards to trim ph and ocs we have the most significant one is the trim on spains smes that was put on hold last year ph to drive help lending to this sector and that obviously with the end of the extraordinary conditions this may come back it could be up to basis points and then we have some other smaller ph ocs that might happen before the end of the year although some might be postponed for next year could be up to basis points so worst case scenario i think were talking tops basis points and with regard to the tltro we increased tltro in the region of billion relative to what we had last year sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa next question please operator the next question comes from sofie peterzéns from jpmorgan please go ahead sofie peterzéns q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi here is sofie peterzéns from jpmorgan i had a question on the nii outlook youve mentioned that volume growth was very strong and nii was holding up quite well in the quarter but how should we think about the nii outlook in spain going forward and my second question would be on your tnav it was down around quarteronquarter are you doing anything to keep the tnav a little bit more stable going forward have you any hedges in place and how should we think about the tnav growth going forward and the last question would be just a followup on the previous question what kind of macro assumptions do you have for your various geographies for example in spain are you using the bank of spain macro scenarios or how are you thinking about the macro picture in your different markets thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay thank you sofie for your questions let me to elaborate in the nii in uk going forward so as josé mentioned in the presentation probably weve seen the worst already in the first second quarter so its a liabilities repricing exercise that is going on and were starting to see these starting in may is going to accelerate indiscernible will go back to kind of normal in the fourth quarter so accelerating this probably in the banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 fourth quarter we should go back to what we had the previous year and after the repricing of all the liabilities thats the reason why we said and josé said that were optimistic on the nii evolution in the uk this is basically a liability repricing across all the deposit ratio second related to tnav question to josé going forward macro assumptions you mentioned specifically spain we are working in the region of gdp decrease this year and a significant recovery next year i dont remember exactly the number but i think was or or next year as i said to you our sga is not far away from maybe a bit better or a bit worse country by country but on average not significantly different than the one of imf the tnav do you want to elaborate on this josé josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa no i mean the tnav josé antonio already said that if you look at the two charges that we made in the first quarter obviously the impairment of goodwill has no impact on tnav the dta is hard and we would not expect to have any oneoffs affecting tnav going forward so obviously the evolution of tnav will depend on our capacity to generate earnings affected by the currency the evolution of the fx but as josé antonio said was extraordinarily high in the first quarter in the first half and we would not expect to see the same level of depreciation of the currencies in the countries where we operate in the second half so with all the things being considered i think we can be quite more optimistic about the tnav evolution in the coming quarters sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you sofie next question please operator the next question comes from mario ropero from fidentiis please go ahead mario ropero q analyst fidentiis equities sociedad de valores sa hi good morning my first question is on fees in the uk could you please explain how much was the impact of the regulatory cap on overdrafts and how much you expect to recover in the third quarter and then the second question is on loan yields in spain which went down significantly in the quarter despite some marginal help from euribor so is the pressure on yields in spain due to ico loans and what do you suspect in the coming quarters thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yeah so fee income in the uk you rightly indiscernible to overdrafts as you know we were not allowed to apply in the overdrafts the integration we were planning to apply was a mandatory and this reduced our capacity to indiscernible it goes more to the nii than on the other but we were expecting to lose netnet between nii and fee income like million million million and now we are million lower than that or something like that so its the numbers i have in my mind so were going to recover somehow charging interest on the overdrafts in line with what we want to do but was not allowed to do this quarter and this will come back in coming quarters loan yield in spain is pure mix so its through ico loans came basically in line with the existing loans and the mix has changed a bit the consumer lending decreased the weight of the consumer lending decreased while the cib and large corporates increased and this result in a drop in the loan yield that well if you ask me going banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 forward whats going to happen as long as we recover the level of activity that we are doing right now in the retail arena we should be able to recover somehow to the previous levels or even higher levels depending on euribor as you rightly pointed out that it has an effect euribor is like of our portfolio euribor mortgages are of our portfolio sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you next question please operator the next question comes from carlos peixoto from caixabank bpi please go ahead carlos peixoto q analyst caixabank bpi hello good morning a couple of questions here first one would be on the dividend and then on the dividend on earnings so if i do some math on the basis points accrued on the first half earnings it looks as though youre implying here an to payout ratio are expected payout ratio on earnings is that the case then on nii in brazil we witnessed a strong compression in margins and basically with volumes growing at the healthy pace i would say nii was still down i guess that changes in mix can account for part of this probably interest rates as well but i was wondering how do you see this going forward so basically whats the outlook you see there on nii and also on the cost of risk by the way thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay thank you so dividend we accrued basis points well this has i will take the number as the strong ph signaling effect that provided that the macro conditions remain as we behave as were expecting and subject to regulatory recommendations we dont have in mind any specific payout but we have in mind or what the scenario in which we are working is were going to be at the top end of our core equity tier target and that is or going to be close to or around and this will allow us to keep a dividend naturally first based upon the profit generation but i will not take this basis points compared with the profit we generate in the first half as a guidance for the payout for the whole year probably the payout if we are right in the macro scenario and the profit generation is the one we expect probably we can go beyond that provided we are allowed to do so nii in brazil so two different nii in brazil there is a product that in brazil they call cheque especial that is kind of overdraft in brazil that the interest rate was very high and the regulator put a cap in this product this product will last well we were last year we start to reduce our presence in this product and in fact our market share was close to now its and this is the main impact so its a bit of mix and the main impact comes from this specific product that has very high indiscernible extremely high cost of risk so it has an impact in the nii a significant impact also in the cost of risk so now going forward you mentioned interest rates interest rates are not as important in brazil as they are in our jurisdictions given the high reserve requirements it matters but i will say in the first year probably is a netnet positive the impact slightly positive afterwards may turn a little bit negative but at the beginning its not as important in our market due to high reserve requirements in the country banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 the main effect come from mixed change due to this specific product and that we have been doing more activity ph in large corporates meaning to say that on a likeforlike basis our spread in brazil is increasing significantly so lower volumes higher spread on a likeforlike basis the mix and this product are the ones indiscernible nii the cost of risk in brazil well in fact we are developing or we developed a full plan to address collections and recoveries in the country and we do not expect an spike i think at this stage we are clearly much more optimistic than my perception where the market is so we are not seeing that large deterioration maybe we in this environment moratoriums are not that high in brazil they last only for one or two month they came back so im not pessimistic about the outlook of cost of risk in brazil unless the situation deteriorated further from the macro due to the health situation of the country but as i said im not pessimistic on this sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you next question please operator the next question comes from stefan nedialkov from citi please go ahead thank you stefan r nedialkov q analyst citigroup global markets ltd yeah hi guys good morning stefan from citi two questions on my side the first one is on capital have youve done any synthetic risk securitizations which may or may not have helped your capital in the quarter and also whats the outlook for synthetic risk securitization for the rest of the year the second question is about the moratoria you gave us some interesting statistics on the nonperforming loan ratio on moratoria loans that have expired just to probe that a little bit further whats the percent of clients that were furloughed within that billion of mature moratoria loans and related to that are there any geographies and products that youre not accruing nii for in terms of moratoria loans for example mexico or other countries thank you josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa okay so in terms of securitizations we did a couple that were really very small relative to what we thought we could that we had in our budget but they were insignificant i think it was like million or something of risk weighted asset i believe so it was not significant basically because the market was closed for most of the quarter but it has started to open so we would expect to be a bit more active in the second half probably not reaching our expected activity for the year but clearly a bit more active in the second half than in the first half and indeed we are working on a couple of more sizable transactions to be closed over the next few quarters a few months josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay one question was about the moratoria the billion the percentage of the billion that is the moratoria thats paid as of midjuly the percentage i mentioned in the presentation was very much in line that went into nonperforming were very much in line with the ones was paid at the end of june in line with the and thats what we can share with you at this stage banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 and the other questions stefan your question was accruing nii moratoria loans the majority of the moratoria loans i think the only big chunk of moratoria loans that are not paying interest are the mortgages in the uk yes the majority of the others they keep paying interest and the moratoria applies to principal so what weve done for example in mortgages in spain are not ph voluntarily wages and in other jurisdictions is to keep paying interest and not paying the principal so were accruing interest for example in the uk for the mortgages that are under moratoria so we accrue and in emerging markets well emerging markets as you know not due to this crisis so its the way we accrue and the way we write down remember that in those markets we write down after five six month all the consumerrelated credit cardrelated lending the writedown happens very quickly okay so if the moratoria when the customers come back to the moratoria and we accrue some interest on this and we get unpaid immediately goes jumps into the writedowns so it happens its not like in mature markets where it takes longer sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa okay last question please go ahead operator the last question is from adrian tang from credit suisse please go ahead thank you adrian cighi q analyst credit suisse hi there hi there this is adrian cighi from credit suisse thank you for taking my questions then i have two questions please and a brief followup so the first one is youve written off billion in dta citing a deteriorating outlook yet you recommit to the to rote target can you give us any more color as to how to reconcile the two the second question is on costs youve achieved an impressive performance on cost reduction this quarter again and you also note that youre indiscernible to do more any chance we can get you to quantify or provide us a range on some of these potential incremental cost saves and then maybe a followup on cost of risk and trying to give your outlook in a different way you mentioned the significant frontloading cost from ifrs models but would you expect a meaningful decline maybe in cost of risk next year thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay so the billion dta is naturally our outlook in the medium term i mentioned that our outlook hasnt changed in the medium term provided that the scenario we have in mind works and i mentioned in the presentation that the impairment was related with the impacts and profits in this period in the next two years so two three years to recover the previous levels what happens with the dtas so when you factor these two years or lower profits at the very beginning where the discount rate has little effect is significant and leads us to this charge and at the same time remember that we put a higher discount rate so the same applies to the dtas higher discount rate that at the end is of the impairment as i said globally billion in impairments i said billion coming from outlook particularly lower profit in the short run and the rest from the discount rate the same applies here so i think its consistent in the mediumterm banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 target we are now seeing our capacity generate profits in the markets in which we operate as we see today the market is there and i dont see any reason not to get those targets the cost reduction the second question the quantified cost savings our plan is to update later in the year but for sure we are much more optimistic as a result of what has happened in the crisis the behavior of the customer our capacity to operate our operational capabilities that ph were showing the crisis for sure and were going to produce higher cost reductions than the ones we commit to you in europe that is as you know were billion nominal drop in costs in europe we already got million in the first half sorry thank you josé and were going to achieve easily this target yeah and we will update you once we finish our plans more in the fall or at the end of the year the last question was sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa the cost of risk next year indiscernible josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa well i do expect if we are right with our scenario i do expect to see a drop next year naturally so otherwise the macro should be significantly different than the one we have again this is the area in which the uncertainty is higher naturally we are seeing what is going on with the covid on a daily basis well we are working as i said before with any scenario in which we live in the scenario we live today in europe and us with the economy open up to a point with some restrictions on travel but operating as of today the economy for a while till we get a vaccine ph when we get a vaccine i think that we should be able to reduce the cost of risk sergio gámez toro global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa okay so im afraid we need to leave it here thanks everyone for joining this call obviously the ir team is at your entire disposal for any followup so thanks very much see you next quarter josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa bye banco
