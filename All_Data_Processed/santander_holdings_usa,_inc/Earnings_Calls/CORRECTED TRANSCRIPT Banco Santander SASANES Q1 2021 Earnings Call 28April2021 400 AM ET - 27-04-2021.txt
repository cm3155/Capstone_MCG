management discussion section unverified participant good morning everyone thanks for joining to this grupo santander first q earnings call as always we have our group ceo josé antonio álvarez and the group cfo josé garcía cantera who will address the presentation the slide we published earlier today at madrid time before we jump into the questions obviously the ceo will address the highlights for the first quarter and the group performance then the cfo in detail the different business areas review before handing over back to josé antonio for the key takeaways and then the qa so with no further delays josé antonio please josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa good morning to everyone thank you for making the time to attend to this conference call so i should say that we have had a good performance in the first quarter we have delivered growth in the quarter net operating income the preprovision profit increased on the back of revenues on growing banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 and cost being flat in constant euros this was driven by greater volumes repricing deposits and the strong cost control in this environment naturally in the middle of the pandemia the digital adoption keep accelerating now more than of our sales were made through digital channels compared with the in  compared with the first quarter of revenue was higher efficiency improved a lot mainly driven by europe and the cost of credit also improved notably to basis points loanloss reserves stood at billion while nonperforming loan coverage of we have barely used the provisions overlay that we made last year as a result underlying attributable profit reached billion and underlying return on tangible equity stood at in addition we recorded expected restructuring charge for the whole year for the whole million net of taxes resulting in an attributable profit of billion the core equity tier ratios was with an organic generation in the quarter strong organic generation on the quarter of basis points including basis points that we accrue to remunerate the shareholders equivalent to of  underlying profit the bank is accruing through the year or its intention to accrue it through the year the proportional amount of to remuneration of holders once the supervisors allow to do so the tangible net asset value per share grew quarteronquarter and while its true that we still live in an environment with significant uncertainties going forward particularly those related with the vaccination process and when the economy is going to go back to normal on top of this and you already know we announced our intention to make a cash offer to repurchase our outstanding shares in santander mexico around of the stake in the company this transaction is expected to be completed in the second or third quarter of this year so if we look at the quarter i should say that weve been living in an environment in which we have had still expansionary fiscal and monetary policy with very low rates although we should say that we start to see some changes in the quarter brazil in our footprint are ready to raise rates in the first q but in general we still have very good or very low rates across the board in relation with the on the social front lockdowns and restrictive measures with different intensity in different countries and different time but this has affected significantly particularly household and individuals and consumer activity in the countries in which we operate on the other hand state guarantee programs had a negative impact on the revenue also even if it expect to benefit the cost of credit so we have different speeds in the vaccination that well is producing different outcomes among major economies we are seeing already a significant rebound in the activity in the us uk has had significant volume levels and in the eu we are starting to see some rebound starting back in march and accelerating a bit in brazil sorry in april going to the group performance i should say starting with the income statement ph share rates and you have two columns there in the presentation had a strong negative impact yearonyear ph percentage points in revenue and percentage points in costs excluding then revenue grew driven by all the pl lines we continue to deliver an excellent cost performance in all the regions and we are doing especially well in europe as a result net operating income as i mentioned before grew yearonyear in addition lower loanloss provisions compared with previous quarters and lower cost of credit which i will describe later in more detail all in all the first quarter underlying attributable profit reached what i already mentioned billion finally we recorded million sic million expected restructuring charges for the year as a whole mainly in uk around million portugal around million and corporate centre and others around the remaining million following this  attributable profit stood at billion banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 overall all income statement lines performed well supported as can be seen in the slide by our diversification ph however geographies showed virtually the same weight i mean the regions and recorded a strong profit increase of note probably was the us with equity net profit of million in the quarter digital consumer bank which contributes to of the groups underlying profit also increased its profit significantly that is also the case for our global business as cib had an excellent quarter with a result above million profit if we look at the trends in the pl we see revenues going up quarteronquarter due to the strong performance in cib on the back of our strong activity with our corporate customers and the continued recovery in net fee income that came mainly from cib and other activities because as i said before the activity with indiscernible in the quarter due to the lockdowns costs were down mainly driven by falls in north and south america as the fourth quarter usually affected by seasonal factors as the result net operating income increased quarteronquarter loanloss provisions plummeted by with broadbased fall across regions and most markets digital consumer bank also recorded sharp falls finally underlying profit exceeded billion notably higher than in the previous quarters ph i focus more in the nii i should say that while nii grew its a result of higher volumes plus in loans plus in deposits the cost of deposits management that i mentioned before positive impact from the tltro and well its one of the highest figures in the last couple of quarters moreover its worth recalling that the first quarter has always some seasonality compared with the  as for yearonyear performance by country i should remark the good performance in the uk plus on the back of higher customer balances deposit repricing actions that offset were partially offset by lower asset yields spain plus driven by higher volumes and tltro brazil plus due to greater volumes that offset lower interest rates the us remained flat despite interest rate cuts on the other hand mexico fell due to lower interest rates and lower portfolio volumes impacted by the pandemic and having a relatively cautious approach to the credit risk when you go to net fee income well continued to be affected particularly on the households by the lockdowns in most countries and seasonality as of the year in brazil despite this environment the ph opportunity in net fee income quarter after quarter from the loss of  allow us to recover  prepandemic levels and from here we expect to start to grow if the pandemia behaves as we are expecting on the back of better activity on the consumer household side of the business our strategy has remained focus on growing loyal customers and higher valueadded services and products these were reflected in the positive performance in cib insurance wealth management and other business that in total they account for of the group total fee income cards and transactional fees were dampened by the pandemic and the uk reflected the impact from regulatory changes to overdraft since april by region north america grew with rises both in us and mexico south america with growth recorded in chile and argentina while brazil start to recover and europe minus with generalized declines except poland due to lower activity on the household side that ive been commenting across the presentation on the cost side well very positive performance so we see europe costs falling and north america although they grow inflation as you know in mexico is relatively high and south america is performing extremely well when you see in real terms our efficiency improved a lot at the group level now it stays at slightly below and i want to remark productivity gains significant productivity gains in europe where costincome ratio stays now at when last year this period we were close to banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 we are building a new operating model across the group that will enable us to accelerate our transformation and further increasing productivity and remain one of the most efficient global banks in the world going to credit quality so we have here the npls basically flat with improved cost of credit to basis points driven by lower loanloss provisions in most countries particularly in the us brazil uk and also in spain looking at the threemonth annualized provision the cost of credit in the quarter was basis points that well in the first q of was almost double due to the provision overlay we took at this time loanloss reserve stood at billion while nonperforming loans coverage at as i said the overlays still in the balance sheet that we did last year is mainly in the balance sheet in summary amid existing uncertainties especially in europe we see areas that are performing better than expected such as the us looking forward we also expect an improvement in individuals we are seeing consistent trends on the individuals household credit quality and we are somewhat more prudent about corporates in particular the smes that is going to depend very much on the recovery of the economy that we expect to start in second third fourth second and third mainly quarters of this year all this enabled the group ph cost upgrade to perform better than expected and while this is more moving towards our average cost across the cycle while this strong operating performance translate into the ratio of the return on equities in the return on tangible equity in the quarter eps growing nicely and tangible net asset value that should reflect before they translate the good results the good consistent i will say sustainable results towards the ratios the main financial ratios on capital i already comment on the strong organic generation basis points in the quarter due to the net effect of the basis points increase from profit and riskweighted asset management and the negative impact from the shareholder remuneration of basis points this positive performance was offset by regulatory impact basis points is the ifrs phaseout and markets impacts on the ifrs portfolio and fullyear expect that restructuring charges of basis points that were bringing forward to the first quarter so now we hand it to the cfo josé garcía cantera that hes going to elaborate about the different areas of the group josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa thank you josé antonio and good morning everyone ill start by audio gap our global scale our customer focus and our diversification really helped once again our business and profit growth in the quarter in europe we are executing our business transformation to accelerate growth through a more efficient operating model that should allow us to progress towards our mediumterm return on tangible equity target of to in the first quarter it was loans grew and customers with positive trends since the beginning of the year in all markets revenue growth was versus the first quarter of last year with strong cost control and efficiency improvements in addition we had lower cost of risk at basis points in the quarter in north america sharp increase in deposits in both the us and mexico while loans fell due to the negative economic impact from the pandemic and more importantly from the disposals of puerto rico and bluestem banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 underlying attributable profit was up strongly yearonyear driven by good net operating income and lower provisions in the us return on tangible equity was if we adjust for the excess capital in the us in south america doubledigit growth in both loans and deposits net operating income and profits were up driven by a strong revenue growth and lower loanloss provisions in most markets return on tangible equity rose to our digital consumer bank had a return on tangible equity and we saw a significant pickup in activity in march so in summary weve delivered robust performance in all regions in the quarter with a strong business generation positive trends in all lines of the pl moving to the countries starting with spain our strategy remains focused on santander one where customer migration is advancing according to plan in activity we saw positive commercial trends in individuals notably in residential mortgages that were up yearonyear and consumer finance however loans fell slightly in the quarter mainly driven by wholesale banking in line with global corporate deleveraging on a yearonyear basis growth was due to smes and corporates customer funds were higher yearonyear and of note here mutual funds that were up in terms of results underlying profit amounted to million almost three times higher than last year we have resilient total income growing in nii although although this was negatively affected by lower fee income from reduced economic activity from the pandemic quarteronquarter nii was negatively affected by lower day count lower alco portfolio and reduced volumes we continued with the transformation of our distribution model which enable us to grow the net operating income loanloss provisions down and cost of risk improving relative to the previous quarter going forward and despite the uncertainty that still remains in the quarter we expect nni nii growing at midsingle digits and the cost of risk below while operating costs should perform as expected in the uk we had a very positive quarter based on volume growth lower cost of deposits and efficiency improvements in volumes continued yearonyear growth in lending driven by mortgages and smes and customer funds were also up boosted by retail banking deposits and mutual funds profits were higher year onyear here total income increased of note was again net interest income up mainly from deposit repricing actions as well as higher customer balances especially in mortgages fee income was lower due to regulatory charges affecting overdrafts cost decreased reflecting progress on our transformation program and cost of credit was at basis points in the quarter in we expect to be to grow net interest income close to double digits benefiting from new business pricing dynamics and lower funding costs the 1i2i3 account latest changes introduced in april will drive additional improvements in our  nii we remain confident on being able to reduce the cost base by midsingle digits in and we are not seeing any signs of asset quality deterioration in the uk if we move to brazil which had an excellent performance at the beginning of the year both in terms of volumes and results we saw commercial activity recovering precovid levels and we took advantage of that increasing our market share in lending we hit the highest number of mortgage sales in the first quarter and in auto we remain the leader in individuals and we increased our current account customer base all the above was reflected in greater volumes loans grew yearonyear mainly in individuals and governmentbacked smes while customer funds rose in terms of results profit was up yearonyear and return on tangible equity increased to total income was backed by very strong nii and higher gains from financial transactions we have higher productivity and a strong expense management which enabled costs to drop in real terms and reached record efficiency levels banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 loanloss provisions decreased strongly with a very positive cost credit cost of credit performance which fell to if we look at months ph in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter profits up again driven by strong nii and cost reduction which offset lower fee income which is affected by insurance seasonality if we look at we expect loans to grow faster than the market while customer revenue should increase moderately and costs maintain a good trend and we would expect the cost of risk to be lower than last year and in no scenario higher than moving to the us where we believe that the work that we have conducted over the last few years is showing in these numbers so beyond the improved macro conditions that obviously is helping we believe that the work again that weve done in the last few years is helping our performance in the us volumes was impacted by the divestiture of bluestem and puerto rico that i referred to before excluding these perimeter changes loans were up yearonyear with auto originations increasing also deposits continue to perform very strongly we had very good and positive pl performance with underlying profit of million the highest of any country in the first quarter net operating income increased off the bank sic back of strong nii from a strong lease income capital markets fee income and expense management excluding the disposals impact net operating income was up on top of that loanloss provisions decreased weve made significant regulatory progress as the fed terminated its written agreement with shusa and the occ upgraded santander banks community reinvestment act rating to outstanding in private banking bsi announced its transaction to acquire billion in customer assets and liabilities from crédit agricole improving our competitive position in this highly profitable market for we would expect these trends to continue all throughout the pl and maintain a positive performance in asset quality we move to mexico we continue to invest in digital channels and that is strengthening our value proposition with new products and services yearonyear volume performance reflects the normalization of the corporate portfolio following the uptick at the beginning of the pandemic profit was down yearonyear impacted by nii pressure due to lower rates and volumes total income was down again nii was pressured but this was more than offset by which more than compensated fee income and gains on financial transactions costs were slightly up due to higher technology investments but in real terms costs were down loanloss provisions dropped despite some charges recording recorded for certain customer corporate customers when we look at we would expect to see flattish nni nii while net fee income is expected to grow supported by credit cards insurance funds and investment banking cost of credit should start to improve in the coming quarters with nonperforming loans around by yearend moving to our digital consumer bank remember we created this as the leading digital consumer finance bank in europe combining the scale and leadership of santander consumer finance and openbanks digital capabilities as a result of the health crisis new lending fell yearonyear especially in january and february but as i said before we saw strong recovery in the month of march in results underlying profit was million higher yearonyear total income increased slightly compared to nii was down mainly due to lower outstanding balances in spain and interest rate limitations in poland banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 which were offset by higher income from operational leasing activity following the acquisition of sixt leasing germany in cost increased mainly due to digital investments in technology in openbank excluding this the acquisition of sixt in germany cost fell yearonyear we had a strong reduction in loanloss provisions with quite a strong credit quality performance cost of risk was at in the quarter for the coming quarters we expect a strong cyclical growth in consumer finance after one year of the pandemic with a gradual recovery of volumes and a solid credit quality across the european customer footprint moving quickly to the global businesses scib santander consumer sorry corporate investment bank sic banking deliver a very excellent quarter we are held we held leading positions in the rankings of structured finance dcm and ecm outstanding results in the quarter which hit a record high revenue was up yearonyear driven by customerrelated activities costs higher but the efficiency ratio improved to an outstanding although this quarter results are unlikely to be repeated in the coming quarters we expect a positive performance for the wealth asset management insurance sic wealth management insurance business continued to perform well in the quarter total asset assets under management amounted to billion high higher yearonyear for insurance fee income rose total fee income generated accounted for of the groups total and grew yearonyear looking ahead we expect continued growth in line with volumes in this business this is the first quarter in which we report pagonxt so im going to just stop here for maybe a bit longer than for the other countries payments as you know are the cornerstone of our strategy to grow and reinforce our customer loyalty customer santander accepts more customers than any other bank over almost million including million smes of which more than are international customers in europe and latin america pagonxt comprises three different businesses first merchant solutions getnet is already one of the top three acquirers in latin america as you know it started in brazil that is a highly competitive market but the business is growing we are taking advantage of that gaining market share reaching in december in in the first quarter we launched getnet chile providing differential features in the local market generating strong demand getnet in latin america already operates in brazil chile mexico and argentina has million active merchants and this figure is growing yearonyear total payment volume was billion in the first quarter up yearonyear and we would expect to achieve to growth in the medium term for these two metrics this year is an investment year for the company we will generate start generating revenues in europe in the second half of the year to this and obviously we will rely on the newly acquired technology assets of wirecard that have been purchased at a good price and we aim at unlocking their value quickly the second component of pagonxt is trade solutions as i said we have clients with international activities in the last months they let me focus on the two most representative businesses here the first is onetrade which is our global trade and international payments platform it already connects our customers in brazil spain uk chile portugal and colombia and we have over active customers we expect to double the transaction volume yearly going forward here ebury which has a presence in countries offers financial solutions to simplify international trade it has already customers active clients and we would expect its revenues to grow to a year in the banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 medium term and the third component of pagonxt is consumer solutions here superdigital our platform to address the financial needs of the underbanked population is being rolled out across seven countries in latin america this provides obviously huge growth opportunities for us and we believe we can double business yearonyear to this sense superdigital in brazil already have almost active customers with a transaction volume growing yearonyear and now let me finish with the corporate centre where we see results improve yearonyear mainly due to the positive impact of income tax from the release carried out this year and the charges recorded in the first quarter of and the positive trend in operating expenses which improved compared to the first quarter of last year driven by ongoing streamlining and simplification measures on the other hand net interest income was impacted by the increase in the liquidity buffer we had lower trading gains because of the positive hedging results recorded last year and we had higher provisions the net loan provision line includes a charge of million gross or million net which has not been allocated to any specific portfolio so far and it was billed due to the lack of visibility as to the timing pace and strength of the economic recovery and with this ill turn it over to josé antonio thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you josé im going elaborate just to finish just give me one minute on the back of the first quarter results i should say that well the results were solid consistent and sustainable revenue grew equally improved the efficiency and as a result of this i already said that net operating income grows grew nicely so we continue to build on our customer base digital customers keep growing the loyal digital customers keep growing and our customer satisfaction we are top three in the in six markets in which we operate we already recorded the restructuring charge for the whole year and continue to focus on cost control and improving our efficiency ratio we also improved the cost of credit and with an underlying profit of billion the core equity tier ratio is above our target and the underlying return on equity rebound to in the quarter let me to take a look forward for and i should say that we are increasingly constructive taking a look to the business environment we expect activity to increase as vaccination progresses although at different speeds depending on the vaccination progress in different countries amidst some remaining uncertainty we see lower cost of credit with better performance in individuals than in corporate we believe that the demand for individuals and consumption will rebound especially in countries with a faster vaccination rate this would allow higher fee income generation as activity increases regarding the outlook for the main regions in europe we expect high singledigit underlying return on tangible equity on the back of strong household activity rebound margin management net fee income recovery and savings plan execution north america underlying profit trends should be better than initially expected in the us as shown in with  excellent results the auto business is wellpositioned to benefit from strong demand for vehicles leveraging our deposit franchise in the us south america amidst the challenging environment we should deliver continued growth in brazil with an underlying return on tangible equity projected around the digital consumer bank we expect a we have banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 already seen some recovery of volumes toward normalization and solid credit quality as seen in the us potential growth in digital retail banking across europe with operation in spain portugal netherlands and germany through the openbank expect doubledigit return on tangible equity in as seen in  as we progress through the year we are more confident that we will deliver on our mediumterm goals and we remain very constructive on our target for improve the efficiency ratio reduce the cost of credit and increase significant increase of our profitability thank you very much and now we will remain at your disposal for the questions you may have unverified participant thank you josé antonio thank you josé indeed time now to jump to the qa session so please operator we can proceed with the first question question and answer section operator audio gap much operator instructions and we already have a couple of questions the first one coming from alvaro serrano representing morgan stanley your line is now open please proceed alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc good morning thanks for taking my questions two questions for me one the first one is on growth look its clear that provisions on the whole are much better but beyond that it does look like the market i mean the market the multiple suggests that the market is not buying the growth outlook and my questions on that what do you think is missing from consensus numbers because beyond the currency if i look at your mediumterm targeted it does look like europe is the biggest disconnect and if i think about the digital consumer bank you obviously at the end of the year with the full year results you were looking for to double profits medium term if i look at the costincome ratio thats more than billion delta in revenues and in your european operation theres also delta there whats consensus not grasping there is there are you that optimistic that you can grow consumer business there is it purely openbank are you going to do addon acquisitions that we dont fully appreciate and maybe a comment in growth generally and in particular with the european sku and the second question is on capital youre ph million fully loaded it looks like the capital build is going to be better for the remainder of the year would you consider buying back last years scrip as a way to maybe sort of gain back some of the institutional investors that were disappointed last year thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you alvaro thank you for your questions growth a very general question so you know that our business in many id ads and i mentioned in the medium long term is supposed to growth because we have the vision that we have and we are in the geographies we have with plenty of growth in front of us this is by banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 geographies in latin america this year probably the visibility on this is poor the massive depreciation of the currencies in naturally affects the translation of the growth we have had you see the numbers in brazil you see the numbers in mexico and then you see the numbers in chile we are growing nicely even in the middle of the pandemia the translation into euros was not so good in the consumer side thats where do think that we can grow naturally with the lockdowns we are not growing what we are seeing already in march and april these are rebound these activities and we expect provided the vaccination goes as expected we expect to start to show significant growth we can capture growth on the digital consumer bank on the auto space we where we are market leader we were not working in the leasing space we can start to grow there and the digital consumer bank offer us opportunities in the nonautorelated consumer space that we are starting to take so those are the on top of this you have pagonxt josé already elaborate on the growth prospects of pagonxt that we expect to capture in the coming years so this is we continue remarks our growth outlook naturally its difficult to talk about growth in the middle of an economic meltdown due to the pandemia but you see our results the main difference i should say compared with what ive seen in the market is that we are growing revenues and controlling costs and the main difference is our operating income is growing our the pl is not made out of the reduction in provisions naturally we have reduction in provisions but we have top line growth that we expect these to rebound from now onwards due to the improvement in the economic activity the capital second question you said a specific question we accrue as you see in the quarter our intention is to accrue of the underlying profit to remunerate the shareholders it can be a dividend it can be buybacks okay so this depends its up to the board to take they are for bid decision if we are allowed to do so naturally by the regulator but our intention is to continue with this accrual because within that this is sustainable and thats our intention a thank you alvaro next question please operator the next question is coming from the line of francisco riquel representing alantra please proceed francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes i wanted to ask about spain first on the top line nii falls quarteronquarter beyond the of the day count so i wonder if you can update on your guidance it seems to me that the midsingledigit growth rate might be a bit challenging so if you can update on the trends in the quarter and the drivers for the coming quarters and also in spain on the cost of risk it remains high for another quarter which makes sense because obviously the spanish market is underperforming other geographies but so if you can update on how do you see the credit cycle in spain and your cost of risk when do you see then the normalization and at what levels thank you banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay thank you francisco first question about nii well revenue in general in spain particularly on nii well our guidance remains the same so we expect to grow nii during the year around midsingledigit the quarter you mentioned already the day count and was some reduction in volumes and those two affected this but for the whole year we remain confident that we reach the mid the kind of midsingledigit growth in nii and naturally in fee income we expect to make significant progress starting probably well starting in the second quarter and progressing along the third and fourth quarter of the year so we remain constructive on our outlook for revenues in spain in the cost of risk that is your second question on the credit cycle this is a very interesting question as i mentioned in the presentation we are constructive on the credit quality on the households individuals consumer space where we are seeing good trends the moratoria has expired and we are seeing good trend then so we remain confident on this side of the business while in smes particularly in those economies that are not performing not so well on that due to the relative specialization of these economies we dont have simply we dont have enough visibility at this point there are several factors some of them seasonal you know the tourist season if this year is going to how its going to be the tourist season strong uncertainty in relation with this and when the business is going to come back to normal the second question is the credit cycle probably is the right question when were going to have visibility on this probably if you ask me as of today i should say to you that we need at least i dont know two quarters of normalization before we have a clear visibility of the damage of the pandemia in the sme space probably its well its my guess or its the best guess i have so a couple of quarters to see this but make sure that we keep updating you now visibility is relatively poor because well theres a significant number of customers affected by the lockdowns in the sme space microbusiness and selfemployed people although as you know we have a large portfolio protected by state warranty schemes this affect mainly in our portfolio in spain portugal somehow but the largest portfolio is spain a thanks paco next question please operator it is coming from ignacio ulargui representing exane bnp paribas your line is now open please proceed ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas yes thanks very much for taking my questions i just have two questions one on cost performance how do you expect the billion savings to perform now that you have indiscernible digital consumer bank and when should we start to see the benefits of the restructuring charges in spain particularly and in the uk banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 second one is on the cost of risk in the us i mean we have a very good performance of secondhand car indexes that makes a lot of good performance of provisions but i mean what would be the normalized level of provisions that you will expect out of the us going forward thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay thank you ignacio thank you for the question the whole issue of cost performance the billion commitment in europe and the restructuring charge i mentioned the restructuring charge we took all the restructuring charges expected in for spain last year i think it was the fourth quarter josé it was the fourth quarter last year in this quarter we are taking the one we expect for the uk portugal i think its more probably like million for digital consumer bank and like million for the corporate centre on the back of this we expect spain to be the cost decreasing high singledigit uk midsingledigit and the same can be applied portugal and less so in poland and the consumer bank the consumer bank is a different story because these are growth as i mentioned before to the question of alvaro its a growth story and were going to have the two dimensions one dimension in which we reorganize our business in europe and remember that we have banking licenses that were going to reduce to were going to transform into branches and this allow us to reduce costs on the other side we want to grow the retail bank and the nonautorelated business in to grow faster than with the buy now pay later kind of new activities ph handling the leasing in the auto activities and were going to have two dimension on one side were going to say costs due to reorganization on the other side were going to increase the business and were going to grow the business in these dimensions so the billion will come mainly in the proportions of the cost we have the majority will come from spain uk twothirds and the other comes from the other all other units the second question was the cost of risk in the us the normalized level i should say we have two effects in the us one is the cost of risk that naturally goes to the loanloss provision remember that we are not releasing provision in the us we are still providing for the business but its true that the cost of risk is significantly lower on the back of the fiscal stimulus that provide support to households individuals along the us and on top of that we have what you already rightly mentioned the used car prices that support we have a leasing leases and we have residual value and when we dispose the cars once the lease is expired we are making some gains out of this business so the two go in the same direction so having said that and we expect the cost of risk the first part on the back of the fiscal stimulus to remain well below the traditional standards while the leases the used car for the time being much more difficult to forecast its probably relatively easy to forecast one quarter but much more difficult to forecast the long term but its true that we are pricing the leases in a conservative way to try to protect when ph the bump of the used car prices happen that for sure are is going to happen so those are the two engines but for this year the business continued to show for the whole year i expect i we expect very good trends in the business a thank you ignacio next question please banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 operator thank you it is coming from daragh quinn representing kbw please proceed daragh quinn q analyst kbw hi good morning thank you for the presentation and taking my questions id like to go back or stick with the provision charge in the us please and specifically the consumer business a loanloss charge of just basis points this quarter versus a historical number of closer to clearly weve seen over the last few quarters that that number has come down but i just kind of wonder apart from this year and maybe the shorter term impacts of the stimulus what do you think is an appropriate mediumterm outlook for the provision charge in the us consumer business that will be my first question and the second question on brazil and cost growth i think historically your guidance there has been to grow cost below inflation in the first quarter weve actually seen a nominal reduction in costs is that just down to specific trends in this quarter or is it a reflection of a greater focus on cost control in brazil and sorry if i may just a final question on capital a small amount of regulatory charges this quarter maybe if you could just remind us of what we could expect on that front for the rest of the year thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you daragh for the questions i pass to josé the to the cfo the question in relation with the capital the provisioning charge in us as you rightly said is low for the this quarter and basis points weve been more on the high singledigit but this largely depends also on the mix you know that well depends on what well retain on the back on the balance sheet normally we dispose a significant chunk of the prime business that we originate some of these goes to the market ph which you criticize we dispose some of these goes to sbna to our commercial bank that use the deposits to fund this business and the what remains the balance sheet the mix is very important but provide that we had the same mix that in the past that was in the region of if i remember well i am not sure we had like billion of subprime and another billion of between near prime and prime the cost of risk should be in the region of ph and this region has been makes sense that i dont know when probably not this year maybe next year i dont know difficult to forecast this with the economy of the us is well is deemed to perform very well on the back of the infrastructure investment program the fiscal stimulus its very difficult to say when this is going to back to normal provide that we keep the same mix thats still important daragh because the difference in cost of risk between the two business is very very large the second question if i remember was brazil costs yeah the general cost in brazil so in brazil productivity is improving dramatically our digital sales are performing extremely extremely well and on the back of this we are able to increase significantly the productivity and youve ph seen we are keeping is not the same transformation that the one we are doing in europe its not about closing brancheses and all these things its as a matter of fact we are still opening some brancheses in areas in which we dont have presence its true that we also closed some branches in areas that are more crowded but in general its more internal organization of the business and the capacity to increase digital sales and remote sales remote sales from specialized call centers that we incorporate in the last six month ago a new contact center in the south of the country that is far cheaper than it is são paulo for having this business and is performing extremely well banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 and we are optimistic that we can continue to design new ways to reach customers in a market that offer good opportunities to grow and we are capturing some of them you see that we are reducing costs then at the same time gaining significant share in the most interesting products in the country its not brazil is not and is not going to be a cost story its going to be a growth a revenue growth story its more than a cost story having said that we want to increase our productivity in march for example we sold cars in this month with the economy being in the middle of a lockdown and were going to be focusing continue to grow in the country naturally with cost control now im handing back to josé josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yes with josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa capitals josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa expected regulatory charges in capital the sum of some small charges could be between to basis points then there are two the two largest charges that we would expect this year come from the low default portfolios which is coming in the second quarter and that will be around basis points and then the new definition of default which is uncertain when it will have to be taken and the amount that that will represent but we believe it will be in any case less than basis points so more or less we would expect to see to basis points of charges from regulation in the three quarters this year a thanks daragh next question please operator thank you operator instructions and the next question is coming from carlos cobo catena representing société générale your line is open please proceed carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain hi thank you very much for the presentation and taking my questions two quick ones and then just a clarification first one in the uk i was expecting a fairly a better performance in net interest income maybe same as the performance in spain having probably in the low end of expectations but in the in particular where the business dynamics in terms of volumes from book spreads were more encouraging could you elaborate a little bit on why the net interest income decline in the quarter i understand theres a calendar effect but are there other drivers that you could elaborate there second question on legacy assets in spain its not you only i think the whole sector is providing only for the pandemic cost of risk with no much attention on legacy assets and you still carry a high stock of nonperforming assets in spain i would like you to elaborate a little bit on how do you think about that portfolio how do you plan banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 to divest it ph and if you dont will demand topup in coverage to accelerate the exit from this portfolio also on asset quality in spain if you could discuss how much of well spain and this is for the whole group how much of the restructure loans and payment holidays do you keep as performing in your stage portfolio because this is just ph the fact for the factor in general i mean if you maintain the bulk of the potential ph problematic exposures are performing obviously the modeling and the provisioning models will demand lower provisions but when shall we have a clearer view on how much npl information do you provide for to compare with how much potential deterioration could be coming i know its a complex question but if you could elaborate a little bit on how much of the payment holidays is still list under performing stage portfolio that would be very helpful thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay thank you carlos for the questions the first point was uk nii i think josé already elaborate on this so we expect still the nim to accelerate a bit in the second quarter as a result of on the back of further cost deposit cost reduction and having good activity on the volume side in mortgages make us positive on this and for the whole year we should be north of in nii growth in the uk we guide you taking the last quarter in this direction and we remain confident that this is going to be the case you elaborate you made the question about nii that was also raised by ph francisco before you try to understand the first q the first q as ph francisco said that well its mainly drop is ph they can and another and you see the loan book fell like in the quarter and those are the on top of having less activity yeah the activity the new activity in the the activity in the quarters with the lockdown was somehow reduced and this activity partially the fee income generated at the beginning of the origination goes to nii and those are the factors from this when you refer to legacy assets well our provisioning policy and well weve been i would say in the quarter conservative provisioning policy in spain the provision remains pretty high the cost of risk if i remember well is close to basis points remember that before the pandemia we were in basis points basis points now we are basis points we are taking another provision for potential reasons due to the uncertainty and poor visibility on the corporate centre so we think that we are providing we have been prudent in our provisioning in the pl for the potential events that may come including the legacy asset naturally that we take into account in our provisioning policy naturally its not only about the scenarios its also about what we have in the balance sheet in the situation in which theyre at restructuring loans you referred to payment holidays i dont know if i understood you well the question when a customer asks for a payment holiday for a moratoria remains in the stage naturally so for the time in which the company or the majority individuals stay in moratoria once the moratoria expire some of these moratoria were mandatory by the government particularly this happened in portugal in uk and half and half in spain in spain half was granted by the bank half was mandatory by the government the majority of these moratoria expire when the moratoria expire if the customer start to make again normally remains in the stage naturally if the customer asked for another extension that maybe in some cases not but we start to classify accordingly and the customer doesnt pay goes to the stage you know that this is not as straightforward as before and this is how do we classify and thats the reason why you are seeing indiscernible since the pandemia started you are seeing the stage particularly stage as for stage growing accordingly with the behavior of these payment holidays having said that while we the majority of the moratoria already expired banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 you have the numbers in the presentation what remains in moratoria is basically the ones who were mandatory in portugal that is by i think speaking from memory is in september and the ones in spain that are ph inspiring around now because were granted one year ago in april may june and in this second quarter indiscernible the majority and we classify accordingly the payment behavior showed by the customer so i hope i answered your question a thank you carlos next question please operator thank you the next one is coming from fernando gil de santivañes representing barclays please proceed fernando gil de santivañes dornellas q analyst barclays capital securities ltd hi good morning thank you for taking my questions just two questions please elaborate in a little bit more on the nii in spain and europe i just want to refresh the contribution from the tltro programs and how do you see the evolution during the year this would be the first question related to that especially in spain and the uk i just would like to know a comment on the changes in management that we have seen so far and the strategy with the new management teams i guess its not cost related it should be more revenuerelated but just wanted to know if theres any strategic change in those areas and those regions and finally on the restructuring charges you mentioned that were done for i just want to know if there could be some moving on into given these recent changes in these specific regions that we mentioned thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay thank you fernando for the questions starting from the very last one we do not expect on the back of the cost the one europe program additional restructuring charge its done for the billion cost savings that we announced i dont know when was in october thats all this is related with the changes in management and the strategy that you mentioned before well when we announced the one europe the one europe is on the back of one santander is the intention to become more integrated in order to gain significant efficiencies operating together so that means that in several products youre seeing the news flow you follow this the news flow in the organization in europe is becoming an organization where the products are some products not all the products some products have indiscernible there are people executives that have european responsibility mortgages and cards and in some other areas and there are also developments in the transformation on the utilization that are in europe the new app is going to be the same in one year for all the group in europe and this is those are the this transformation program having a new head of europe make advisable to do the change that we announced today in order to create the organization that fit for purpose in this regard we have both nathan as the ceo of uk and rami as we announced this morning they remain in the group doing different roles but this is to accommodate the european organization to transformation program that we announced and we are progressing well on this banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 nii in spain i said probably midsingle digit while also in uk double digit a little bit weaker in portugal and well i dont have a specific guidance for poland probably you have josé on the tltro program if you can elaborate on this yeah josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa the yearonyear increase in revenues from the tltro is going to be over between million to million a thank you next question please operator yes the next question is coming from sofie peterzens representing jpmorgan please proceed sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi here is sofie from jpmorgan just to follow up on the previous question unfortunately i couldnt hear what the tltro benefit is so if you could just repeat that and then my kind of first question would be last week there were some headlines around santander potentially looking at lease plan could you just discuss kind of what your view is on ma and disposals and has anything changed here and kind of how should we think about any potential strategic ma if you can just remind us what your key ambitions here are and then my second question would be if you could just talk a little bit about brazil whats your outlook in terms of rate hikes in brazil where do you expect interest rates to go reimbursed in and how if you could also remind us of your rate sensitivity in brazil and kind of how do you think about nii progression in brazil thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you for your questions the question on tltro josé josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yes so its as ive said over million to million increase josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay ma activity strategic ma activity well we have nothing to add yeah so we are not we are focused in organic growth we are not looking at any kind of deal that can indiscernible to take well at least naturally we made the offer the tender offer in mexico but those are small nothing that changed the profile of the group brazil so its true that the rates the market expect that the rates keep going up they already raised the rates by basis points the market is more to come and i agree that theres more to come on the back of relatively high banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 inflation and these affect the business in a way that you have the figures josé how much is the sensitivity to higher rates in brazil josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa brazil is very much balanced so its slightly negative basis points parallel shift in the interest rate curve is less than million so its very much balanced for the group as a whole again a parallel shift upwards of basis points is a positive billion a next question please thanks sofie operator the next question is coming from adrian cighi representing credit suisse please proceed adrian cighi q analyst credit suisse hi there thank you very much two questions for me one on capital and one on asset quality on capital and specifically on capital requirements how do you see the impact of the upcoming stress test on santander youve previously mentioned that you expect the stress test to be harsher than previous ones but do you have any visibility at this stage on the contours of the outcome and then on asset quality can you give us maybe the moving parts of the overlay provisions youve made last year and how much of these provisions remain unutilized thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa so the first question capital stress test we are indiscernible its too early to provide you with any numbers we send the first numbers as you know we tend to perform very well on the stress test on the back of our diversification yeah so knowing that the scenario is harsh but well i remain confident that were going to continue to perform very well on the stress test but its too early to call yeah so the discussion with regulator about to start and well see the different interpretations they have in relation with our numbers the second asset quality the overlay i said in the presentation ph the good value used the overlay i think on the billion probably we used million maybe a million josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa million hes telling me so the majority remain on the books and well i gave you already my outlook for the credit quality the majority of this is related with consumer and consumer is evolving very well and well well see this is too early to call and significant uncertainties remain and we prefer to be prudent at this stage and remaining with the capacity to offset potential future losses just in case something goes wrong with the banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 vaccination and the recovery that everybody expect including ourselves but the situation advise you to be prudent yeah a thanks adrian next question please operator thank you the next question is coming from jernej omahen representing goldman sachs please proceed jernej omahen q analyst goldman sachs international okay good morning from my side as well id like to ask a couple of questions and theyre all related to the capital return prospects so the first question you gave us an update at the end of the fourth quarter on your interaction with the ssm on the dividends and the prospect of restrictions being lifted i guess were three months closer now to the 30th of september and i was just wondering if theres anything more that you can share or perhaps give us insights as to the discussion with the relevant authorities on this topic do you feel more less confident or is the situation exactly the same as it was at the end of the year and the second question i would like to ask is when you think about riskweighted asset growth for this year and then perhaps further out what kind of number do you think is realistic for the group josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa the capital return if we have additional information ph like the one we share with you at the end of the last year in reality we havent got any additional information other than the one that was made public at some point was the interpretation of the market the ssm was more constructive and they are pointing towards the provisioning level levels visàvis of the potential the uncertainties surrounding the economic activity that what we have is one quarter of more visibility as i said in the presentation more constructive on the consumer individual side but i remain with significant uncertainties on the smes and corporate books and for that reason i think i repeat a couple of times we keep providing and not releasing provisions in the quarter yeah so that is what i can share with you in this regard in relation with riskweighted asset growth i do not expect a lot of growth on the back of the market remains in very good shape to release capital through securitizations and the implicit cost of equity at which you can release capital at least up to today is well below the cost of capital at least this is clear on the more granular type of portfolios if that remains our riskweighted asset grow is going to be somehow limited and probably josé can give you a number on the back of being pretty active in securitizations that weve been doing in the last i dont know couple of quarters and we always look at the market in this direction we can release capital significantly below the cost of capital we do and the market now is in good shape for that reason i do not expect significant growth in riskweighted asset josé do you want to say some josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa no this year like josé antonio is saying we dont see riskweighted asset growth and we are working to compensate the regulatory charges that we discussed earlier on looking forward we think we can on over the banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2021 long term we can have risk obviously this is excluding regulatory changes we think we could sustain more or less a riskweighted asset growth over time a thanks jernej im afraid we are running out of time but we have time for one last question please so lets proceed with the last question operator all right it is coming from ignacio cerezo ignacios representing ubs your line is now open please proceed ignacio cerezo q analyst ubs ag london branch yeah hello good morning most of the questions have been answered but i have two on capital left if you have any view or color on the impact of the us fiscal reform im thinking of dtas in the country if any and then the second one ive seen a higher charge loan credit impairment in poland which i think is related to the fx mortgages how much more is coming do you think actually throughout the year and now thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa to tell out the fiscal reform you can do the math so the main information is the rate the final rate and naturally if this increase is going to have an impact not very significant i dont have very specific number because i dont have ph we try typically should expect i dont know if this is already known or not people indiscernible the high charge in poland you were right absolutely right its due to the swiss francs our provisions there stay around million so well as you know this is subject to the supreme court ruling or decision that is going to come if i am wellinformed next month but has been delayed already twice and is expected to come in days josé or something like that yeah 15th of may is expected and well the provisions you mentioned were made on the back of this unverified participant okay we need to indiscernible here everyone so thanks very much for attending this call obviously the entire ir team is at your disposal for any followup so thanks and keep safe josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief
