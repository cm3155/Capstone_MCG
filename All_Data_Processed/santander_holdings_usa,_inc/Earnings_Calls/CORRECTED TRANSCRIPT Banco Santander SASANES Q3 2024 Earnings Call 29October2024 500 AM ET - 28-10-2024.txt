quarter earnings presentation like always the presentation will start with our ceos héctor grisi comments followed by my more detailed explanation of the pl he will have his concluding remarks and then we will open it up for questions héctor please go ahead héctor blas grisi checa chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you very much josé good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us at todays presentation as always first i will talk about our results in the context of our history then josé will review our financial performance in greater detail and then i will conclude with some final messages as josé said we will then open the floor for your questions so the main highlights of our results in this first are the following  was another record quarter for santander which continues to demonstrate the benefits from the execution of our strategy and the resilience of our business model profit reached billion above the  of on the back of a solid franchise of million customers that continues to increase as we improve our customer experience through simplification automation and leverage of our global platforms profit reached billion in the first nine months also a record of supported by strong customer revenue growth across regions and all the global businesses we achieved these as we invest for the future and we continue to make excellent progress towards a simpler and more integrated model which has helped us to improve our efficiency by basis points and increase our rote to finally our balance sheet remained solid with a sound capital ratio and robust credit quality and contributed to the strong profitable growth shareholder value creation and attractive remuneration tnav plus dividend per share increased by and the cash dividend per share will be higher in going into more detail into our income statement as always we present growth rates in both current and constant euros this quarter there were no material differences between them yearonyear but as josé will display later they are more significant on the quarteronquarter our pl remained strong from top to bottom number one strong top line supported by all our businesses and regions nii and fees both at record levels accounted for over of total income driving the vast majority of our revenue growth number two expenses grew below revenue and inflation showcasing the possible effects of our transformation sorry the positive effects of our transformation three loan loss provisions grew fairly in line with average lending and credit quality also had an excellent performance all in all as shown over time our results are sustainable and less volatile than peers due to our business and geographical diversification the high quality of our revenues and a prudent approach to risk we are on track to exceed the targets we set in january and upgraded in july solid business dynamics supported high singledigit revenue growth our efficiency ratio improved as we accelerate one transformation and the increased operational leverage cost of risk is expected to remain in line with our target on the back of active risk management a strong labor market and interest rates dropping in most of our countries as a banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 reference yeartodate cost of risk improved to even with the additional provisions in poland in  our cet1 ratio ended september at and we are comfortably in line with our target of keeping it above even after basel iii implementation fully loaded and our rote is already above the target we set for the end of the year our execution of one transformation continues to boost our operational leverage structurally improving both revenue and cost performances simplifying and automating processes and our active spread management have already contributed basis points of efficiencies since we started surpassing the levels which we expected to reach at the end of our global businesses continued to drive the groups profitability and have delivered basis points in efficiency gains finally our proprietary and global tech capabilities have generated basis points in efficiencies so far remember that we are focused on going back to basics offering the best products and user experience to our customers and boosting operational leverage through our global platforms to support value creation for our shareholders based on profitable growth with minimal volatility this is already reflected in the great performance of our businesses all of them show solid revenue growth retail and consumer and will strongly improve our efficiency ratio leading to higher rote while cibm payments reflect our efforts to develop new products and global platforms which have started to deliver results this is a fantastic example of how our model works higher interest rates benefit some of our retail franchises while other parts of our business perform better under different circumstances but overall our combination of highly diversified businesses allows us to deliver consistent profitable growth and value creation the global businesses and the crosscollaboration are helping us to extract the full potential from our unique combination of local leadership and global capabilities with a cost of infrastructure that delivers efficiency and scalability this allows us to reach our profitability targets in retail which is at the heart of our banking business we are working to become the numberone bank for our customers lets look at how one transformation is delivering results innovation is key were enhancing our digital onboarding and promoting simpler customer journey and better experiences across the bank for example in brazil we have reduced the onboarding time by which has contributed to a customer growth only this quarter we are progressing fast towards a common operating model across our banks which together with automation and digitalization frees up time of our people to focus on commercial activities on our branches dedication of resources to noncommercial activities has dropped by since we started with one transformation deployment of our global platform remains on track and for example in the uk customer has been migrated to our global app that already operates in spain portugal poland and openbank with great success as a result our profit grew yearonyear with rote up basis points to on the back of revenue up close to double digit on good performance of nii and fees with all regions growing especially europe and south america cost is well under control down in real term reflecting structural benefits from our transformation and provisions improving and the cost of risk fairly stable at really comfortable levels going forward our improvements in customer experience the implementation of a common operating model and the deployment of our global tech platform will drive additional customer growth better efficiency and profitability in consumer our priority is to continue expanding our leadership across all our footprint our bestinclass global solutions are integrated into our partners processes for example we have integrated our front in hyundai systems providing our customers the best digital experience faster credit approval and time to pay banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings

the deployment of global platforms is key to scale up business reduce our cost to serve and improve profitability last monday we reached an important milestone in the us with the nationwide launch of openbank in the last four weeks we have already gathered around million in deposits and welcomed over clients we also launched zinia a cobranded card with amazon in germany and we are deploying a new operational ph digital functionality consumer continues to grow a strong operational leverage with a net operating income increase and ph sound profit growth on the back of number one strong revenue with solid nii performance and fee growth number two cost falling in real terms thanks to our transformation efforts even as we continue to invest in growth and third llps normalizing in europe and in the us in line with expectations overall we continue to see positive operating trends and we expect them to improve on the back of lower rates and volume growth we are building our worldclass cib business for our clients that leverages our strengths and global footprint to grow profit while maintaining the same low risk profile number one we are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the us building on our areas of expertise to accelerate growth across the group revenue in cib in the us rose yearonyear and is expected to boost crossborder revenue across the group as we continue to progress on our us buildout initiative we continue to execute our global markets plan which is starting to pay off with the institutional sales doubling in europe and more than tripling in the us number two were expanding and sophisticating our centers of expertise were strengthening our financial sponsor franchise which is leading to business opportunities in ma capital markets and gtb across the group and continues to pay off with several first deals this quarter for example for the first time we were appointed sole book runner for an ipo of a spac and we acted as the lead left underwriter in an lbo transaction with one of the largest industrialfocused investment firms and these are just a few examples of a long list third we are driving crossborder revenues on the back of enhanced client solutions and global collaboration we had a great number of crossborder deals in  such as those resulting from the collaboration of our teams in mexico and spain france and brazil peru and mexico or italy and france among others cib reached solid results with revenue up after a record making the first nine months the best ever indiscernible growing at double digits and the vast majority of our growth coming from client flows and the rest is still to come growth will accelerate going forward as we continue to execute our strategy on a global basis moving on to wealth we continue to build the best wealth and insurance manager in europe and the americas how number one by improving customer relationships through the best customer service and right solutions resulting in doubledigit growth in private banking customer and fees we are shifting our product offering towards valueadded solutions such as discretionary portfolio management advisory and alternatives investments and this is also supported spains doubledigit increase in the number of private banking customers and a total revenue growth number two is promoting collaboration with other businesses especially with retail and cib which is a major driver for growth and allow us to capture network benefits collaboration fees increased by yearonyear number three is developing global platforms across all the businesses and digitalizing our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and really promote growth good examples of these are the banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 recent implementation of a single operating platform for alternative products and the deployment of ph san conecta in mexico and brazil which boost the distribution network capabilities and provides realtime information about funds and markets in summary were accelerating growth and maintaining high profitability attributable profit rose on the back of a strong activity and fees growing at doubledigit across the three businesses finally efficiency improved basis points yearonyear and rote rose basis points to finally payments as i already advanced last quarter we have a unique position on both sides of the value chain ph issuing where we manage more than million cards worldwide and merchant acquiring in merchant we are one of the largest acquirers in latin america spain and portugal with the right balance between growth and profitability getnet total payments volume and pagonxt open market revenue keeps growing strongly which is helping us to consolidate our presence in core market such as brazil and mexico where we maintain a leadership position and at the same time we build up market share in fastgrowing markets such as chile where we recently launched getnet our payments hub already processes all type of payments for example credit transfers direct debits or instant payments and international payments for several countries and businesses we have already migrated million transactions this year this is five times more than the same period last year also we continued to deploy plard our global cards platform in brazil we currently manage more than million debit cards through plard and we are on track to full migration by  to manage around million total cards in our second phase we will start with the credit card portfolio at the same time we continued to boost our cards proposition through our risk data lab our solution based on ai payments delivered strong results with good revenue trends in both businesses costs under control and sound credit quality in cards which drove to a profit growth excluding the nonrecurring items ph with its cost in  pagonxt ebitda margin improved to backed by getnet with one of the best ratios among our competitors we expect cost efficiency and capex optimization to continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters our capital ratio has improved this year from to backed by strong organic capital generation after investing in profitable growth absorbing regulatory impacts and shareholder remuneration as a result we continued to grow our ph value creation which in terms of tnav plus dps increased which represents around billion yearonyear and we are increasing our shareholder remuneration in september the board of directors approved an interim distribution against h1 results which is being executed in two equal parts a cash dividend of per share which will be paid from the 1st of november and a share buyback program up to billion this is currently underway cash dividend will be higher in and at the same time since if we include the full amount of the current share buyback program santander will have repurchased of its outstanding shares i leave you now with josé who will go in our financial performance in more detail josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa thank you héctor let me go into more detail the pl and the capital as héctor has mentioned we are yet again reporting record results as our transformation continues to drive operational leverage revenue grew on banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 the back of the highest nii and fees in our history and the best efficiency ratio in the last years boosting the net operating income which rose yearonyear provisions grew only slightly even after the expected normalization in consumer and the swiss franc provisions in poland we recorded in the second quarter while cost of risk fell in the quarter on the righthand side of the slide you can see the upward trend in profit which grew quarteronquarter in euros in constant euros driven mainly by customer revenue and lower provisions this quarter there is an effect from the depreciation of some currencies affecting the quarteronquarter in comparison but as you can see in the pl the impact yearonyear is not material please remember that the last quarter we decided to take a more conservative approach to value into recognizing the value of the results obtained in argentina so we began to apply an inflationadjusted exchange rate for the argentine peso which in the quarter was ars compared to the official exchange rate of ars to the euro and obviously this is a much more conservative exchange rate than the one used by our peers this approach caused some distortions in the quarteronquarter comparison that i will comment during the presentation only where relevant total revenue increased with all businesses and regions growing driven by customer revenue growth which made up more than of total revenue this strong growth was primarily supported by our retail business which continues to grow close to double digits with good performance in nii and fees especially in the americas and also by cib growing across the three lines of business on the back of good activity levels mainly in global banking and markets consumer revenue also rose supported in this case by volumes and active asset repricing and doubledigit growth in fees across our geographies we also delivered doubledigit revenue growth in wealth driven by solid commercial activity both in private banking and in asset management payments is growing at good trends showing relatively good underlying performance as both pagonxt and cards increased even more so if we exclude the onetime positive fee recorded in brazil in the first quarter of last year finally the corporate centers revenue improved on the back of less negative impact from fx hedging turning to nii net interest margin most of our revenue came from net interest income which increased year onyear supported by all our businesses and regions basically due to active price management particularly in retail in europe and in consumer and higher volumes and the benefits from negative sensitivity to rates in south america in retail south america which is now very evident especially in brazil and chile and also good activity levels in our global banking business in cib nii was resilient quarteronquarter rising in constant euros in a new interest rate environment particularly driven by retail where it was up with the vast majority of our countries positively contributing in the quarter especially brazil driven by higher average volumes poland due to better spreads and higher volumes and the uk supported by good price management in terms of profitability we improved our net interest margin yearonyear this is explained by higher yields on assets as we actively manage credit spread focusing on profitability not market share which more than ph outweighted higher funding cost we were able to contain thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration in europe and deposit repricing downwards in south america as we commented last quarter we are seeing a slight deceleration in net interest margin and net interest income in line with our expectations please remember that the decrease in net interest margin in the second quarter was banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 due to the prudent adjustment we made to the exchange rate in argentina and this quarter net interest margin was also affected by the hyperinflation accounting in argentina under the appreciation of the real and the mexican peso and to a lesser extent the beginning of a new interest rate cycle in europe over the last few quarters we have gradually adapted the sensitivity of our balance sheet to position for these new monetary policy cycle this and the positive contribution we expect from our consumer businesses put us in good condition in a good position to mitigate the effects of margin compression expected in europe and north america going forward in an environment of low credit demand in general we generated another record in fee income reflecting our transformation efforts to promote connectivity across the group and provide the best customer service retail increased as more customers chose santander as their primary financial service provider we added million new customers over the last months to a total of million customers outstanding performance in consumer largely driven by increased insurance penetration in europe cib also grew from record levels last year especially in the us on the back of strong dynamics in global banking we had a increase in wealth with all three businesses growing at double digits and payments was impacted as i mentioned before by the onetime positive fee recorded in the first quarter in in brazil our transformation towards a simpler and more integrated model continued to deliver structural efficiency gains our cost to income ratio for the ninemonth period improved to the best level that we have reported in the last years one of the best in the sector and is already at better levels than the guidance we provided for cost declined yearonyear in real terms despite the lagged effects from higher inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation by business costs remain very well under control in retail and consumer which represent of our cost base more than of the nominal cost increase came from cib as part of our strategy to reinforce our cib franchise cost remain contained in wealth even with higher commercial activity and were fairly flat in payments even as we invest in global platforms as we look ahead structural improvements from our new operating model which help us achieve our target of maintaining cost to income at around in while it should improve further next year credit quality remains robust about around and across our footprint in line with our expectations we record low unemployment rates in most countries and easing monetary policies credit quality improved yearonyear as reflected both in the npl ratio and lower coverage needs the npl portfolio has collateral guarantees and provisions that account for of its total exposure 12month cost of risk improved to in our retail and consumer 12month cost of risk improved in the quarter in retail there were some underlying trends across the different countries cost of risk improved across europe and remained at very low levels in the uk and portugal in brazil it fell for the second quarter in a row and in mexico it also declined in the quarter following a year of expected normalization similarly in consumer 12month cost of risk was impacted yearon year by the normalization we expected but it dropped in the quarter to the cost of risk in the first nine months of the year was putting us in good position to end the year comfortably within our target of finally turning to capital our fully loaded capital ratio remains at a comfortable level backed by strong organic capital generation and significant riskweighted asset mobilization this quarter we generated basis points organically on the back of basis points from profit generation partially offset by riskweighted asset growth and by minorities we recorded a 26basispoint charge for shareholder remuneration in line with our payout policy we had basis points of regulatory charges mostly related to model updates in low default portfolios banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 and finally we had positive impacts from the placement of santander poland and alco portfolio valuations which were offset by impacts on deductions pensions in the most part for the most part we continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital profitability and productivity our disciplined capital allocation is resulting in a new book return on riskweighted assets of in the quarter which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity of well above that of our back book at our centralized asset management desk which aims to optimize capital deployment is achieving outstanding results in the first nine months of the year we have disposed of an amount of capital equivalent to billion in risk weighted assets at a cost of capital of half of that of new originations in addition onethird of our balance sheet that matures every year is being substituted by more profitable new business the combination of these actions explains the expanding profitability and resilient capital ratio thats all from my side héctor back to you thank you héctor blas grisi checa chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you josé it is important to say that our progress towards the targets we set for in our last investor day is ahead of plan as we continue to leverage our unique competitive advantages and excellent execution of our strategy by our teams sound cet1 levels and strong execution of our capital allocation plans further improving our profitability towards and delivering value creation and increased remuneration to our shareholders in conclusion the benefit from the execution of our strategy are evident  was another record quarter on the back of strong customer revenue with all regions and businesses contributing which results in the best nine months profit ever with alltime high nii fees and net operating income at a eps growth sustained progress in our structural changes towards a simpler and more integrated model leveraging the groups scale is driving both high revenue and lower cost to achieve the best efficiency ratio we have reported for the last years our rocksolid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and doubledigit shareholder value creation as a result we remain on track to exceed the targets we set in january and upgraded last quarter and we are in a great position to continue growing increasing profitability and delivering shareholder value creation the progress of the last years to simplify and align our model in all our businesses and now deploy our own tech stack is already evident and as we continue to execute our strategy we will deliver on the primary target of doubledigit tnav per share plus dps growth through the cycle and now were very happy to take your questions thanks josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa so thank you héctor operator please lets begin the qa session please banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we already have the first question from ignacio ulargui from bnp paribas please go ahead ignacio ulargui q analyst bnp paribas exane thanks very much good morning everyone and thanks very much for the presentation and for taking the questions i have two if i may the first one is on nii just to get a bit of a better understanding of the moving parts of the nii during the quarter and also how should we expect about the group top line group nii in coming quarters the second one would be on cost outlook given the solid performance that we have seen in the quarter how should we think about cost performance going forward and as per josés comments in the presentation what kind of improvement should we expect in terms of cost to income for thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you ignacio let me give it a first hit and then josé basically could give you other idea its interesting to see that if you see nii in constant youll see that its up okay the effect of argentina is the one that hitting us in the current euros okay it is important to explain first of all that the sensitivity of our balance sheet to movements in rates is mostly concentrated in retail and commercial business this is about of the group balance sheet with some parts showing really positive sensitivity in europe and others are negative ones like the one we have in brazil as you already know europe and brazil concentrate about to of the rate ph exposure over the past few quarters we have been very proactively managing and working to reduce the sensitivity of the different balance sheets and position them to lower rates environments for example in the case of europe we have reduced the sensitivity to around thats one quarter of what was at the beginning of the rate cycle in places like brazil for example we are taking measures to reduce the sensitivity further by doing some things to the alco and also taking some hedges as you have already seen this year the retail business its operating leverage is points we are growing the top line not just because of higher interest rates but also because were changing the operating model which is the most important part that you guys need to concentrate were growing customers for example million in the third quarter alone and we are keeping cost flat which is quite important because thats creating an operating leverage and improving our margins and this basically a thing that we will continue improving thanks to first of all the geographical and business identification the strong focus on capital allocation and the strong focus on profitability that we have up to this point i dont know josé if you would like to complement on the margins and then well take on cost josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yes definitely thanks héctor so let me explain argentina in a bit more detail in june we used an exchange rate of ars and we explained at the time that we are devaluating depreciating the exchange rate with inflation independent of the official exchange rate the official exchange rate as of now is ars for the quarter for the end of the quarter we used ars and remember that when you use ars in inflation accounting you adjust backwards all the accounts to that exchange rate banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 so we had two impacts on our pl one there is over million negative quarteronquarter increase in the monetary position that comes in other income and in argentina as interest rates come down and we have a very liquid balance sheet that is invested mostly in bonds the yield earned on this bond portfolio is lower and quarter onquarter there is over million drop in local currency when you look at local currency there is over million drop in the yield coming from these investments so argentina actually explains most of the drop in net interest income quarteronquarter but also it means around a million over million impact on total revenue so as héctor explained we have been reducing our sensitivity to rates both in euros and in brazil which obviously outside europe is the highest sensitivity we have in europe we have been buying an increase in the alco portfolio if we look at the total euro alco portfolio we have which is spain portugal santander consumer finance we have billion in euro government bonds with an average maturity of over years and a yield of the second action we took was to float the liabilities the market liabilities and we also hedged the repricing of our mortgages in spain by signing some forward starts so this has reduced the sensitivity of the net interest income in euros quite significantly to around a quarter of the sensitivity we had prior to entering this cycle of higher rates in brazil we did the opposite in brazil we are changing the mix of the liabilities and also floating the assets net net when we look into over we see nii down a little bit in current euros but we see nii up in constant euros thanks to these measures that we have discussed and these estimates are based on forward curve rates forward rate curves sorry héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you josé ignacio in terms of cost it is very important that you understand the following this is not about a costcutting exercise this is about changing the model and the goto model were basically introducing in the whole group its talking about i mean take a look at the amount of the catalog of products that we have in the group we have diminished them by almost a third from products were down to less than for example we are changing completely the model were doing in strong simplification were doing a lot of automation but most importantly by deploying the global platforms we are working together and spending less money on what we do every single day so one transformation is driving structural efficiency gains and operating leverage just a piece of that the cost grew less than half of the revenue growth were delivering positive jobs that are helping to reduce the efficiency to which is basis points lower than a year ago this is placing us on track to meet the target being at in so were going to be much better and we believe that were going to continue that the new paradigm is focusing on absolute cost okay our ambition is not to lower cost is exactly to lower cost in absolute euro million terms which is quite important given all the different countries that we operate it is true that costs are up but we look at the cost performance in real terms in real terms costs are down minus yearonyear thats a remarkable performance as to the operating leverage with the strong declines that i described in retail reflecting the transformation effort and the cost containment in consumer and payments while we invest in the global platforms and continue to grow right so the higher cost as josé explained reflect also the currency depreciation and the seasonal effects ph and salary agreements banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 bonus accrual and cib is the bulk because were investing in the business to basically get out of it more revenue and its actually getting there so in efficiency ratio is around we acknowledge this ratio is already at the level we committed for the id target and all the investments we have been doing will not only help maintain cost flat but grow the revenue faster so our ambition is therefore to do better than initially planned next year in in the cost to income as we described so i dont know if that basically answered your questions josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa thank you and we can take the next question please operator the next question comes from the line of francisco riquel from alantra please go ahead francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes hello so thank you for the presentation and taking the questions first one is on motor finance business in the uk i know that you need time to analyze the recent ruling but i wonder if you can give an indication of how big the provision it needs whether we are talking about hundreds billions or and also the impact on the business and my second question is on capital if you can update on the regulatory impact spending for this year and next and also on the basel iii impact of up to basis points on a fully loaded basis other banks have reduced the impact at the recent regulatory updates so if you can also comment on this thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you francisco okay first of all let me tell you that i mean as you correctly said its not possible this time to reliably predict the financial impact of the ruling other elements that affect the financial impact on our accounts this said in any event the potential impact is not expected to be material for the groups financial position okay it is very important nor will it affect the achievement of the group financial targets for so if you make the numbers and we are reiterating the guidance of above that basically tells you where do we believe the number is okay so its very important and i will reiterate that again that it will not change our guidance so that basically gives you a ballpark idea of where do we believe the number should be i dont know josé youve i left something out or josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa no no indiscernible héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa i think its quite clear no banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah i think thats perfect yeah héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa and in terms of why dont you go to the capital thing is josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah remember that we estimated supervisory charges to be between to basis points in the second half of the year we had basis points in the third quarter we still believe that its going to be at least to basis points so this doesnt change our target so our target for capital for yearend remember since the beginning of the year has been between to we are at in the upper end of the range and we think we could we will close the year more or less at this level for next year dayone basel iii impact basically close to zero slightly negative to slightly positive but its not going to change much so dayone capital ratio for santander under basel iii will be more or less the same with which we will end and the fully loaded when i mean fully loaded i mean fully loaded taking into account all the charges we expect up to so we are not excluding the to charges so fully fully fully loaded we think the impact is going to be basis points which means that we will be on dayone above the that we set as our target fully loaded capital above on dayone fully loaded thank you thank you paco next question please operator the next question comes from the line of alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc so can you hear me okay josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yes go ahead alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc can you hear me yeah okay sorry yeah i just had two followup questions really one on capital generation so youve given basically a very limited impact for the next years which youre already at and with the mobilization youre doing on the balance sheet it does look like you generate youre going to generate capital above the youre currently sitting on so the question is as we think about are you willing to operate in a range of to lets say or do you expect to grow into that or would you consider sort of increasing any distributing in any excess or increasing the payout i just wanted to understand how youre thinking about that capital generation if we do have that excess capital generation banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 and on and apologize to follow up on the santander uk because thats the only explanation in my view why the share price might be down this morning youve been quoted josé as saying that its less than million and i understand its not an impact for but it might be an impact beyond that so any details you can give us on the book if its new cards the size of the book or any details that make you confident that were looking at a relatively manageable number that would be great thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you alvaro okay let me explain to you a little bit what is very important i mean as you know josé explained you exactly what were doing in terms of rotating the balance sheet okay you got to understand that were changing completely the model of the bank in the way we used to the bank used to consume a huge amount of rwas to generate profits okay were changing the model in a way and the most important thing of that changing the model is becoming the numberone bank to our clients by becoming that basically you generate quite a lot of quite a lot of revenue by something different i just used rwas in order to generate those that basically explains you the good fees momentum that were having and youre going to continue to see that over in the future all right so if we continue changing this model use less capital to become actually much more profitable that basically will tell you that we could be able to accumulate much more capital than were doing today all right we feel really comfortable that we can manage the bank very well at these levels of capital but i do believe that well be we will be accumulating capital also as we have a tremendous capacity to generate assets we also have now with the asset desk in place tremendous capacity to move those assets out of the books all right so and by the way if you saw what josé said we are doing so and making money on top of it also were servicing were getting fees and servicing the assets that we sell so its a double whammy in that sense so the model of the bank is changing in that sense and is becoming much more profitable and less dependent on capital so yes i believe that capital generation will be much better and we believe that we could be accumulating more capital on an organic way in the future on the uk josé i dont know if you want to also complement something on capital josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa no i think capital you answered perfectly alvaro the issue is complex and i think just let me remind you of some of the things that we need to clarify in the next few months we need to clarify the perimeter of commissions we need to clarify the vintages because the ruling talks of between to the fca focuses between to the percentage of redress the claim rate the compensatory interest so there are many moving parts the ruling has been taken to the supreme court we expect the fca report in may so there are many moving parts we are analyzing these and obviously we will make a very conservative assumption once we are able to come to a conclusion on all these variables that need to be put into the estimation however we are very confident that as héctor explained the impact and im talking about what we will charge in the next few weeks with this conservative approach will not be material for the group and we will still meet our objectives our return on tangible equity target for the year which is or slightly above and thats what we can say what happens with the fca report in may thats basically a speculation so obviously we will make a decision based on the actual ruling based on if we have time to take into consideration the supreme court guidance on these and in any case obviously the provisioning that we will take will be a conservative provision banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 thank you alvaro next question please operator the next question comes from the line of antonio reale from bank of america please go ahead antonio reale q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning its antonio from bank of america two questions for me please the first one is on the outlook for loan growth in brazil if i look at loans were flat quarteronquarter in local currency which is perhaps not particularly encouraging for the nii outlook in the context of rate hikes in the region can you talk about your expectations for loan growth here and what this means for nii in brazil and maybe could you also please remind us what the time lag is with respect to repricing between assets and liabilities in brazil i understand your liability reprices much faster than assets if you could remind us how many months in lag that is and my second question is with respect to the us profitability i mean these are the parts of your business thats negatively correlated to rates youve been adding quite a decent number of investment or corporate bankers in the region which is showing good momentum in fees could you maybe just talk us through the key pl line items and if you see these numbers as sustainable going forward please thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you antonio let me go a little bit i mean through the brazil situation okay to tell you a little bit whats going on its very important that you understand the following in brazil also we are changing a little bit the model that we have today as you know we used to use very highly rwas we used to basically give out a lot of loans now were changing a little bit the way we do things were basically focused on profitability okay laser focus on profitability which is basically changing a little bit the mix also changing a little bit i mean the way we manage and were managing the loan portfolio as a portfolio by division we used to basically grow in every single segment now were not doing so were basically looking at the segments that basically have the best profitability and the best cost of risk in equal so were being very choosy in the way we manage that and were doing that all along the group also we are very much focused on increasing the amount of clients and the amount of transactional clients that gives deposits and have their deposits with us there are also their payrolls and its quite important to understand that that basically is going to improve margins because were improving the funding of overall of the franchise in brazil okay nii if you see this is a good quarter its up more than in the quarter it is more than in yearonyear whats behind the performance as i told you healthy volume growth changing the mix and the local rates because were doing and increasing the number of clients you will remember in my presentation i talked about the new onboarding that basically is very competitive and is basically getting us much more clients it is true that the rate outlook has changed well now the market is having some rate hikes that will mean the nii growth will be a bit less intense than we expected and we thought at the beginning of the year but nevertheless we still expect brazilian real to grow around the midteens mark by the end of and we will have further growth in and if we continue with our strategy on gaining clients and gaining more deposits at a good place i think we could be better off okay banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 and let me take the opportunity also to flag the opportunity that brazil has delivered almost a rote this is strong profitability improvement it is not just reliant on nii growth but also it is very important the good delivery on fees because also as i explained were becoming the number one bank to our clients so selling other products insurance so more things that are basically helping us out also it is very important to take a look at the cost contention that we have had and also and stable cost of risk in the year i believe that and i dont believe i really remain very optimistic on brazil and the ability to continue expanding its profitability through okay i dont know josé if you would like to go in detail in terms of the liabilities josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah so liabilities in brazil basically reprice automatically with interbank rates so almost of the liabilities are linked to the interbank rates of the assets mature in months so that gives you a sensitivity of the positive sensitivity sorry negative sensitivity we have to rates in brazil héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you let me go into the us antonio so its very important to understand first of all that we are not a full fledged commercial bank in the us we are focused on the businesses we are focused okay we are focused mainly in our consumer business the consumer business as you say has negative sensitivity to rates thats exactly why we launched openbank there and were also using sbna our commercial bank to fund that right weve been also changing the mix in a very strong way i was looking at the numbers in terms of the new mix we have and youre talking about a mix that is with ficos really on the prime and nearprime level okay and were decreasing the amount of risk that we have to deep subprime and subprime so that basically mix combination and is going to give you a pretty good idea of what were doing there in terms of consumer its very important that you understand that i mean as you know we are ph an atscale player we are also leveraging the relationship we have with the oems and we were able to capture very good agreements with ineos lotus tesla and mitsubishi it is very important for you to understand that some of these changes in the pl youre not going to see them at the revenue level due to the fact that a lot of these is basically done for example on the electrical vehicles and the electrical vehicles were buying them because its mostly leasing so that basically tells you that its not going to appear on the revenue line but youll see it on the take back we have on the tax that we get back for the electric vehicles so that basically changes a little bit the outlook but all in all i really see that the us will continue to thrive over the next year or so okay also in the commercial side the business is doing well we have ph this expertise we also you know that we have this jv with the fdic which has been tremendously successful and i think will continue so it has had a solid performance and then you talk about the cib advisory services cib just grew yearonyear in terms of the fees that we are collecting on that business but also you dont see how the us is helping the rest of the business to thrive if you take a look at the fees in cib in europe also are being pushed up by all the businesses we are doing by using the us teams to help us out getting some of new business that we didnt use to get also in latin america if you take a look at for example not just crossborder ma but if you take a look at what weve been doing in dcm you will see that we have become one of the three most important players in dcm in banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 that market just because of the expertise we brought into the table so when the mexican ums did a billion transaction at the beginning of the year we were one of the four banks and we were the only nonamerican bank in the game so those are the particular things that are happening to us given that now we have this with the local strength that we have were combining the global expertise that were bringing on to the table and wealth also we have a leading brand in latin america that business is basically working as a swiss clock so i really do believe that the us will continue to thrive very good outlook for and really good numbers coming up in terms of the pl we see there josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa thank you antonio the next question please operator the next question comes from the line of marta sanchez romero from citi please go ahead marta sanchez romero q analyst citigroup global markets ltd good morning thank you very much my first question is on spain so you have been losing market share in loans and deposits over the past year you have recently made management changes at the top for the spanish business do you foresee a change of strategy or indiscernible capital but how do you see loans and deposits in spain going forward my second question is on the us deposit so the cost and the volumes are flat in the quarter youve just only launched openbank in the country on your website youre saying youre paying times the national average for deposits how much do you expect in terms of volumes to gain from your openbank franchise and where do you see the cost evolving and just quickly and im not sure if indiscernible correctly the us effective corporate tax rate for i understood that there are changes on indiscernible tax credit thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa we couldnt hear you the first question at all so could you repeat that one sorry about that and the second question was about the us but we lost part of it marta sanchez romero q analyst citigroup global markets ltd sorry its a question on spain so sorry this might be sorry for that so on spain youve been losing market share in longterm deposits over the past year you have made management changes at the top so do you expect a change of strategy more risk appetite where do you see loans and deposits going forward in spain secondly in the us so youve launched openbank so far your volumes and cost of deposits are flat in the quarter how much deposits do you expect to bring to the platform and where do you see the cost going forward and sorry the effective tax rate in the us thank you and indiscernible banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you marta let me go ahead in terms of the many changes we have done to spain basically theyre not going to change the plans that we had before were going to basically very much focus on profitability thats number one were also changing the model spain is one of the most important places where we believe we have an opportunity on one transformation okay due to the fact that we believe there is a huge opportunity of simplification automation in what we have there a lot of if you compare one of our branches for example in portugal versus our branches in spain of what we do in our branch in portugal is basically taking care of clients of what we doing in spain is taking care of incidents problems different situation etcetera so its very important that we do that simplification and then transformation and automation that we need to do on the back in spain so we make our business much more reliable much more efficient and with a much better cost structure thirdly we are as you know deploying the global platforms and spain is one of the places that were going to be concentrated the most in the near term all right so its quite important to understand that we will continue doing that and we will continue basically focusing on managing the deposit rates as we have done right so maybe much concentrated on that getting new clients it is very important to acknowledge that for the seven consecutive months we have grown on clients in spain in a mature market that basically tells you that the model is working that exactly were delivering on what we believe is the right thing to do so we will continue to do as we have been doing in the past in terms of transforming in spain in what we need to do but also with the global platforms were going to be able to be much more competitive more efficient and better for our clients also this structure of being the numberone bank to our clients is very important in spain because this basically will allow us to sell them more products one product that is very important and we are punching below our weight is insurance for example in which some of our competitors are much more bigger than us in that sense so theres a huge opportunity of where we can do that also if you take a look on cib cib ph we have had a really interesting and important lever given that were using our us teams to support what were doing here in spain so that is helping us out quite a lot and weve been actually number one in the market for the whole year so spain will continue as we say in terms of josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa the tax rate in the us héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yes please josé josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa or you finish that banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa no no i wanted to talk a little bit i mean ph joe said that i believe that in all in all is going to be a strong year for spain we remain optimistic of nii we see growing in high singledigit together with customer growth as i told you and higher transactionality and we will drive our revenue up by about doubledigit here the efficiency ratio will continue improving and we see the cost of risk below basis points by yearend okay and also strong improvements in rote to a level well above so josé if you would like to comment to the us josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah just quickly marta this year the tax rate is going to be more or less close to zero actually were going to actually have a slight credit from the sale of evs and from here it should gradually normalize as we do less evs and more contribution from other businesses so we could think of like around next year maybe the next year so gradually normalizing at that pace at more or less next year the following year yeah okay thanks next question please operator the next question comes from the line of carlos peixoto from caixabank bpi please go ahead carlos peixoto q analyst caixabank bpi yes hi good morning a couple of questions from my side as well firstly on the us on the uk nii outlook we saw good recovery in the first q we actually saw improvements in loan yields and also a lower deposit cost i was wondering if you see this trend prevailing into the fourth q and into should we expect margin expansion to prevail or should we expect it to stabilize the customer spreads to stabilize more or less around these levels just basically how do you see the outlook for nii in the uk and then if i may pick up a bit on the interest rate sensitivity questions that were raised before you mentioned that you lowered the nii sensitivity in spain to of what it was prior to the change in rate cycle i was just wondering if you could update us on exactly where the sensitivity lies now particularly for spain but also for some of the larger geographies that would be much appreciated thank you very much héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you carlos okay on the uk i would like to tell you i mean i think it is one of the countries that we have one of the greatest opportunities in terms of one transformation we have a very good advantage of simplifying thats something that we are very concentrated on also the automation what were doing there we are actually lowering the amount of people that we have we started the year with people were going to end up with so simplification and automation is well underway and then as i said on the presentation it is quite important that we already start deploying the global platforms oneapp came into the uk just about we did a big bang and changed all our clients there and its becoming really helpful in order to gain new clients helping us in the deposit base and also helping us in terms of nps okay banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 it is important to say that we believe that we have much better market and economic dynamics okay lending activity we see it picking up we are very much also focused on profitability in that market as well we see more rational behavior of the uk banks better pricing on the new loans plus their pricing of deposits we are proactively managing deposits as i told you first of all with the new clients coming in with the new edge account that we launched thats been helping us so we reiterate our view that nii will improve in the h2 versus h1 okay as we have said were going to finish with nii down only midsingledigit instead of the minus that we have reported in the first nine months and we expect further rate cut in the remaining of but the outlook of is positive in the sense of what we have seen so far josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa so carlos in terms of interest rate sensitivity so let me comment for the main countries for the group as a whole first in constant euros as i said we would expect nii to increase next year maybe in spain you have seen a interest rate in europe for the mid of next year of we would expect a slight decrease in nii in spain in the uk sector just commented a slight increase in nii in the us we would expect high single digit increase in mexico mid to high singledigit increase in brazil this is quite important the outlook for interest rates in brazil is really important to estimate the future evolution of nii we expect average interest rates in brazil next year to be around with this level of interest rates nii in brazil should be up midsingledigits and basically and finally in dcb also high singledigit increase with the level of interest rates that we just talked about so as i said if you compare these with the sensitivity in the way up that we had in the countries in europe for instance or in dcb as interest rates were going up the sensitivity we have in the way going down is significantly significantly lower thank you carlos next question please operator the next question comes from the line of andrea filtri from mediobanca please go ahead andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa hi thank you for taking my question first of all a question of extrapolation consensus is forecasting no growth of profits in versus you are currently growing profits at yearonyear in the nine months and i know you usually give guidance in february but do you think profits will actually be above in your view and the second is a followup on the capital indiscernible you have done before im looking at slide without regulatory headwinds you would have built basis points of capital in one quarter after distribution can you confirm with  we should exhaust the bulk of the expected regulatory headwinds and is the higher profitability then yielding to higher capital buildup versus the basis points per quarter guidance that you have given us final thing is a clarification on basel iv before you said that on dayone cet1 should be flattish if i remember correctly there were basis points of impacts this year that should have reversed so it wasnt for adoption can you clarify that thank you banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you andrea let me give you a little ph demeanor of what we believe first of all i must tell you that i have great confidence that we will deliver and in some metrics like cost to income over deliver on the financial targets that we said on the investor day for the period of to okay will be better than for we expect to continue to grow revenues especially fees as i explained with the new model deployment that were doing were going to further improve the operating leverage and were going to deliver higher profitability and we will do these how by leveraging further the global and network businesses okay were putting a lot of focus on increasing the network effect were doing more with less first of all leveraging also our products on global factories like for example from our corporate bank into our commercial banks what were doing between cib and the commercial business on the midsized companies and smes also one transformation is leveraging platforms that help reduce the cost to serve in retail were talking about minus on yeartoyear cost per active customer and yearonyear revenue per active customer so since the start of the program the number of products as i said before is down almost okay of the products are now digitally available to our customers thats points up since we started the program right in summary the strategy and business model diversification disciplined approach to capital allocation we will we believe deliver a consistent compound effect that will continue yielding positive results for the years to come so all in all yes josé i dont know if you would like to josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah so let me héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa comment into the capital questions josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa let me give you all the components of the capital ratio and i think you can make your own conclusions here so on page we show basis points of organic capital generation post indiscernible cost of hedges etcetera which includes basis points negative from organic riskweighted asset growth which is billion growth partially neutralized by risk transfer initiatives of around basis points or billion remember that so far this year weve mobilized billion to billion in terms of riskweighted assets and on markets and others we have basis points from the sale of poland so with these i think you can conclude what more or less the recurring capital generation we will be able to have going forward obviously the net riskweighted asset growth gross riskweighted assets net of asset mobilization initiatives is the other key component obviously that excess capital is being or that capital is being reinvested at return on risk weighted assets but obviously its capital that is being reinvested banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 basel iv youre right the maturity will the impact the negative impact of the basis points or basis points we had in the first quarter of this year will reverse in the first quarter of next year and this will compensate the other negative impact dayone impacts that we have mostly from technical adjustments to low default portfolios corporate portfolios etcetera so netnet its obviously zero is the net of some positives and some negatives and amongst the positives is this basis points from the maturity we use in derivatives transactions youre right any andrea thank you next question please operator the next question comes from the line of ignacio cerezo from ubs please go ahead ignacio cerezo q analyst ubs ag london branch yeah hi good morning and thank you for taking my questions sorry im going to come back to capital in particular if you can give us actually the path of those basis points you have on the fully loaded basis actually held out indiscernible actually with the next years and specifically how much of that is going to fall on and sorry if you have referred to this actually but i just want clarification and then related to this and going back basically to what alvaro was asking before i mean what is the preferred use of any potential excess capital that youre building are you thinking basically of accelerating growth spending a little bit of that or its a question basically of also considering the possibility of increasing distributions and then the final on the capital actually if i may what kind of budget for srts actually you have per annum in the next two to three years building up into your capital forecast thank you josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa okay so the basis points as you remember we are not affected by the output floor because we use lots of standard models so that limit to the benefit of internal models relative to standard models we are not affected by that that is backloaded thats what comes later from to if im not mistaken we are mostly affected the basis point is mostly the result of operational risk that will come over the next four or five years if im not mistaken so thats how these basis points are going to be added to the phasing in our case i think héctor already answered the question about the excess capital and budget on a recurring basis obviously the demand for private credit today is enormous its almost im not going to say its infinite but its huge so obviously i dont think we are going to have this type of demand as interest rates come down obviously but we think that on a recurring basis we should be able to mobilize somewhere between billion to billion in riskweighted assets both obviously srts will only be maybe a third of that billion a year it is reasonable to assume that billion to billion will come from srts and the other will be from other types of hedges and other types of transactions asset sales etcetera like we did this year but on a recurring basis with a more normalized market billion billion per year is like a reasonable number thank you ignacio next question please banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 operator the next question comes from the line of sofie peterzens from jpmorgan please go ahead sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah thank you for taking my question this is sofie from jpmorgan so sorry to just go back to the organic ph data generation but on the analyst call that you hosted a few weeks ago you said or indiscernible said that you target net zero riskweighted asset growth and around basis points organic capital generation per quarter is that reasonable to assume going forward and yeah that would basically be my first question and then the second question is that ma is a quite hot topic in europe at this point in time if youre going to generate more indiscernible going forward how do you think about inorganic growth opportunities what would be something that you could potentially consider in terms of product or region and yeah if you could talk about your thinking around ma and then the last question would be around brazil asset quality i noticed that the npl ratio ticked up by quarteronquarter and also coverage came down quite a lot in brazil how should we think about this thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you sofie yes i mean the answer is in organic capital generation yes youre right i mean thats about it okay in terms of the inorganic opportunities i do believe that we have a lot of organic opportunities within the group i think that the chances and if you make some numbers in terms of what we could do by becoming best inclass versus the bestinclass in every single market that we operate that basically tells you the huge opportunity that we have in front of us and we will continue like that we will concentrate on our changes on the goto model of the bank i mean its a process that is going to take us at least the next months in order to have also the global the global platform set in place etcetera so were very much concentrated on that okay and thats exactly what all the focus of the group is today in terms of the brazil asset quality as you have seen i mean as you have seen basically first of all i must tell you that we have very strong revenue performance okay solid evolution on cost okay flat quarteronquarter but we have a really resilient behavior of the credit quality cost of risk is stable at and the more recent vintages are performing well and we dont have any signs of deterioration its very important that you acknowledge what i explained at the beginning in terms of the change of mix and the change of the way we are looking at the brazilian portfolio okay so as i was telling you before we used to grow in every single segment of the market today were not doing so were much more focused on profitability and also on the cost of risk that we have so youre going to see a much better performance of brazil over the next years because were exactly doing so all right so its quite important that youll see that and youre going to see basically that the outlook that we have towards the end of is and stable cost of risk versus around and as i said i mean with the new changes that were putting in place etcetera i think the vintages would perform much better than we expected okay banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa okay thanks sofie the next question please operator the next question comes from the line of britta schmidt from autonomous please go ahead britta schmidt q analyst autonomous research llp yeah hi there thank you for taking my questions a few clarifications when you talk about earnings growth does that apply to current euros as well im just asking as you guided to to nii growth next year in constant euros and it might be a little bit lower in current euros and that i would think would have to drive most of the revenues to deliver positive jaws and then a clarification on the rates you mentioned for europe is that what you expect for the full year then as well or what is the average expectation for the year and then lastly on portugal so the net interest income it declined significantly this year as you saw a big deposit cost increase is this just a catchup where ph the see the competition and where do you expect deposit cost to go in the future thank you josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa so yes we would expect fee income next year to grow midsingle digits with cost fairly flattish so yes we would expect revenue operating income to actually increase next year in terms of interest rates well we think is the rate that we expect by midyear and then maybe one drop one cut more in the second half of the year so we do not see as the terminal rate in europe right now obviously well see but in our case we are not as negative as the market or positive depending on how you look at it in terms of interest rates and then cost of deposits britta you referred to countries which countries spain in particular sorry i didnt get whose which country you were referring to so we will get back to you after the call carlos will give you a call and clarify that but let me just very quickly in spain obviously the betas that we ended up this year having this year were much much lower than the ones that we expected so we managed our cost of deposits pretty well basically thanks to avoiding the transfer of current accounts to time deposits as rates come down those parts of the current accounts that are tied to interbank rates or the euribor basically private banking corporate banking and the large corporations is adjusting downwards as well so going forward we should see actually a positive contribution from yearonyear deposit cost in spain from to other euro countries in portugal the situation is a little bit more extreme so in portugal we would expect nii to actually go down a little bit more than in spain next year because there obviously the situation is a little bit more extreme than it is in spain thanks britta next question please operator comes from the line of chris hallam from goldman sachs please go ahead banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 chris hallam q analyst goldman sachs international i just have just one question left and thank you for the color on nii rate sensitivity so its a bit of a followup question but is the sensitivity to lower euro rates linear as rates move lower or would the negative drag on nii be larger on european rates if we start to move below your expectations or below policy rates you mentioned earlier at the midyear by the end of next year would we need to recalibrate the sensitivity if we start to get towards or below josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa chris thank you it also depends on how steep or flat the curve is a curve that flattens would have a more negative impact on margins than a curve that remains steep so obviously if rates go well below and approach obviously from to the impact on margins is greater than from to so its not linear but if rates stay between and i think we are going to have a pretty good outlook in terms of nii because again the cost of deposits at those levels will gradually approach zero basically and we will have at least that to margin on the asset side thanks chris and the final question please operator the last question comes from the line of indiscernible from kbw please go ahead q hi thanks so much for the time three quick clarifications if i may so first trading income in brazil has been quite weak now for a couple of quarters its been negative can you give any guidance there second the corporate center nii should we expect a positive number in  or again any guidance you could give third i heard you on the tax rate for the us what does that mean for the group so can you give guidance on the group tax rate thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you indiscernible in terms of the trading income okay its in any case very small in the context of brazil total revenue in brazils total revenue and it shall not overshadow the very strong operating performance in the quarter and in the improvement on profitability okay the clientrelated trading income has had a strong performance in  okay however recent market volatility around the brazilian real and the yield curve led to an important deterioration in local assets during  but also in  but we have stabilized those and i believe that the outlook would be much better this is a challenging market environment and weve been basically offsetting this going into  and i believe  is going to be much better josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa nii for the corporate center nii in the corporate center should gradually decrease because of the remuneration of the liquidity that we have at the corporate center so you should expect nii to reflect the lower rates on the liquidity that we hold at group level and finally the tax rate for the group it should be fairly flat next year may be a touch below what it will be this year but just marginally so for model purposes i will use the same tax rate in than we will have in same tax rate banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 29oct2024 josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa and i think weve answered all the questions thank you very much everybody investor relations myself héctor are at your disposal to answer any followup questions that you may have looking forward to
