álvarez josé antonio the floor is yours josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa thank you begoña good morning to everyone thank you for joining us this morning so well i should start saying that the second quarter weve been living in a period in which we saw inflation hitting decadehigh levels interest rates going up ph and start to raise and significant concerns regarding ph lower economic activity in the future so this is to sum up a little bit the environment of the last quarter banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 in this environment we continue to grow our business our customer base and indiscernible into a growth in the loans and deposits and revenues in our pl nii plus fees as you can see in the slide so on the progress in the digital front have been significant in the quarter when we talk about profitability second quarter profit was billion for reaching for the first half is billion higher than the previous year if we look in the constant euros is higher than the previous year the cost in a highly inflationary environment remain well below inflation and our efficiency ratio stood at in line to reach our end of the year target of we improved our profitability ratios the return on tangible equity stays at and we continue to create significant value for our shareholders eps grew compared to the previous year and tangible net asset value per share plus cash dividend per share grew yearonyear in regard with this trend the quality of the balance sheet npls continue to trend down the cost of risk remain well inside our expected range and our capital is slightly above the core equity tier following a strong net organic generation of basis points in the second quarter as i have just mentioned in our commercial strategy while reflecting widespread growth as you can see in the slide weve been growing in individuals both in mortgages and consumer and others in mid to highsingle digit less so in the corporate space where we are seeing relatively flattish loan book in smes and corporates while corporate investment banks growing at so overall loans were up quarteronquarter billion in the quarter which increases in all countries mainly from mortgages and consumers as i said so in summary i think we have a highquality welldiversified portfolio by market and our cfo josé will explain later on in more detail the portfolio by geography some by collateral on the other hand the deposits grew quarteronquarter and yearonyear with a market shift towards time deposits due to the new interest rate environment turning to the income statement well let me just give you a brief overview of the main ideas the performance in euros was better than in the currencies due to the depreciation of euros although we have a negative partially was offset by the hedging included in the corporate centre this is including gains on financial transactions in constant euros talking in constant euros ph goodwill revenue yearonyear at a faster pace than in  on the back of higher volumes interest rate hikes starting to feed through in some countries together with another strong quarter in cib cost management face inflationary pressures but continue to grow well below inflation this allowed us to achieve record preprovision profit of billion in the first half of this year as for loan loss provisions the release recorded in the uk and us in second quarter affected the yearon year comparison finally we had a positive impact from minority interest ph following buybacks in mexico and the us and lower tax ph but mainly in brazil due to the recovery from tax contingencies and others this led to a record first half profit of billion in a cumulative underlying profit recorded the same amount as we dont have extraordinary charges in this first half of the year if we look indiscernible in europe we continue to accelerate our business transformation towards a common operating model these were reflected in our customer growth yearonyear increasing nearly by in the quarter doubledigit growth in net operating income and profit return on tangible equity improved to in north america we are refocusing our position in the us while maintaining a disciplined capital allocation we accelerated growth volumes loans grew in most segments in mexico and in auto and cib in the us we also increased our customer base yearonyear lastly we achieved a profit of billion in the region banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 south america we are leaders in the region with a unique presence strengthened by the group assets and delivering profitable growth our growth strategy based on increasing customers million yearonyear and capturing new business opportunities led to a sharp increase in volumes loans grew and deposits first half underlying profit over billion yearonyear and higher return on tangible equity staying above in digital consumer bank we continued to strengthen our leadership position as reflected in new lending we rose by in ph a shrinking market profit rose to doubledigits and return on tangible equity increased to if we look at performance metrics efficiency ratio i already elaborate on this we are running at now heading towards our target of for the yearend return on tangible equity we are slightly ahead of our target for the whole year and we are on track now to meet our target in terms of eps in the quarter yearonyear versus first half of in underlying earnings per share and we are showing sustained earnings per share growth mainly if we take into account that we amortized almost million shares through the buybacks that is approximately slightly above of our capital the tangible net asset value per share was for including cash and dividends it was in line with the previous quarter and higher yearonyear when it comes to capital the organic capital generation was in line with our expectations net organic basis points if we take into account the payout ph half in cash dividend and half in buyback we are generating roughly speaking after taking into consideration the buyback that is in line with our expectations per quarter and this quarter is not show up in the total capital raised due to the fact that the held to collect and ph sell marktomarket and detract basis points on our capital and this offset the growth in the organic generation so we are meeting indiscernible growth below loan growth and we showed that this is one of our targets better profitability in the front book and reducing the weight of riskweighted assets that indiscernible producing a return on equity below the cost of equity we are progressing well on those targets and this is show in our profitability finally before i hand to josé i would like to highlight santanders strong commitments in esg mainly i want to refer to the new targets we published just a couple of weeks ago on top of the already existing targets in relation with power generation and coal we published specific targets for energy aviation and steel and used the absolute level of emissions in the region of for the relevant period from to well you have the figures and we are provisioning green finance and we appointed a new head of green finance in order to first to measure properly to classify properly according to european taxonomy our loan book and to generate a business and help our customer to a greener economy for our customers well as you know we are very active in the social problem particularly in latin america with financially empowered people you have the figures in the presentation overall im proud of the group progress on delivering in our responsible banking commitments to help to tackle global challenges both in the climate front and in the social front i will now hand to josé that elaborate on the group and business area review and finally i will do some final remarks banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa audio gap just provided a brief overview of the main highlights for the quarter and i will go into more detail about the pl of the group and the progress of the country and business areas in the quarter we earned billion after recording regulatory charges of nearly million million for the resolution fund and million contribution to the new institutional protection scheme in poland in the first half total income exceeded billion both nii and fee income grew at in constant euros and accounted for of total income trading gains and other income decreased compared to last year mostly affected by fx hedging which detracted million and also from lower lease income alco portfolio sales in higher regulatory contributions in the quarterly performance we saw similar trends revenue up excluding regulatory charges let me take a moment to go through the main drivers of nii in more detail group nii was up supported by a broadbased growth in loans and deposits coupled with margin management and interest rate hikes in uk and poland as a result net interest income and net interest margin increased from last year to in the first half of this year you have all the information on the slide but i would like to highlight the following by country we had very strong nii in the uk and poland as i mentioned because these are the two countries where we see the impact of higher rates in europe we also had robust activity in both countries spain and poland we decreased nii by and respectively despite the rising volumes due to the continued pressure on yields and lower alco portfolios in the us nii was affected by the bluestem portfolio disposal and consumer loan pricing competition mexico nii up due to strong loan growth in individuals and corporates and finally in brazil nii rose but by volume growth and credit mix which was particularly offset by negative sensitivity to initial rate hikes we expect this negative impact from liability repricing to level out in the fourth quarter of this year and turn positive into next year regarding fees we had very positive performance in all regions supported by greater activity in high valueadded products and services as you can see on the righthand side of the slide all countries increased the income with exception of the uk which was affected by the transfer of the cib business to the london branch it wouldve been flattish excluding this impact and in the us affected by the bluestem disposal and lower overdraft fees in terms of cost we kept our target of growing cost below inflation while improving the efficiency in europe of course were down in real terms with widespread falls across countries and the efficiency here improved percentage points in summary we continue to make structural changes to our operating model to drive new productivity improvements in the future turning to risk the group maintained positive credit quality ratios the npl ratio was basis points better than in the previous quarter and most markets improved in spain it fell basis points due to portfolio sales total loan loss reserves stood at billion and the loan loss coverage at up percentage points in the quarter the distribution of the loan portfolio by stages remained stable and even stage assets were lower in the quarter our cost of credit stood at basis points this is last months if we look at the first six months of the year the cost of risk was basis points in line with our target for the year i would like to drill a little deeper into loanloss provisions and cost of risk performance by country in europe all countries remain below or were negative in spain cost of risk improved due to lower loanloss provisions and better portfolio quality uk and portugal slightly positive considering only six months in poland improved provisions bau provisions but cost of risk was affected by the contribution to the swiss franc mortgage portfolio banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 the us cost of risk below after the releases loanloss provisions are up yearonyear but are still well below prepandemic levels in mexico cost of risk improved slightly i mean significantly thanks to a betterthan expected performance of the loan portfolio in brazil the cost of risk increased primarily in unsecured individuals which represents around of the portfolio secure individuals smes and corporates which represent of the total portfolio were stable the coverage ratio over ph days is well above prepandemic levels we are better positioned than in the previous crisis as we increased the individual secured portfolio we have less volatility than the market and cheque especial decreased its weight compared to previous crisis in digital consumer cost of risk improved and continued to show outstanding low levels considering the nature of the business finally i would like to show you a brief overview of our loan portfolio its more concentrated in mature markets around in developing markets brazil accounts for just of the group total and of the total portfolio is secured mostly by real estate collateral by segment mortgages with loan to values below account for of the total the consumer lending portfolio is very wellcollateralized and is a very short time duration smes and corporates is covered with real guarantees and lastly of our corporate portfolio large corporate portfolio is rated investment grade and is rated above a a very good quality portfolio let me now make some brief comments about the evolution of our main units in in spain yearonyear results were driven by lower costs and reduced cost of risk in an environment of weak revenue performance looking forward we expect trends to continue for the second half nii should absorb the impact of tltro cancellations but in we expect to reflect asset repricing delivering margin expansion fee income should remain robust in the second half costs should maintain its downward trend pointing to achievement of our cost toincome target and cost of risk is expected to remain around basis points to basis points for the year in the uk we also maintain very positive dynamics in new lending and a strong nii looking forward we expect these trends to continue with nii growing well although probably at lower rates than until today flat costs and cost of risk normalization close to around basis points in the united states results compare to high financials in nevertheless in the first half profit remained very very high above billion our outlook for is lower revenue impacted by lease businesses cost is slightly up partially due to the incorporation of amherst pierpont and better than initially anticipated cost of risk well below normalized levels santander mexico had another excellent quarter for the year as a whole we expect higher nii and fees cost up impacted by investments in digitalization and higher inflation and cost of risk below supporting a credit quality that is better than average in brazil in the first half where we have a negative impact due to our balance sheets initial negative sensitivity to higher rates higher inflation that is putting pressure on cost and the cost of risk that deteriorated in unsecured loans to individuals we earned a return on tangible equity we expect to end maintaining efficiency around and cost of risk below to which will result in a return on equity around all in all in a difficult year we expect a strong set of results and profitability and we are optimistic for when we expect to see an improvement in revenue in the digital consumer bank new business activity increased yearonyear we gained market share particularly in used cars looking forward to the second half the environment will continue to be challenging but banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 we are confident in meeting our goals and expect a record year in new business exceeding the previous record of billion in we expect some normalization from the current low cost of risk rate but should remain well below previous normalized levels because in this case cost of risk has to do more with unemployment than with interest rates and we expect a strong labor market in europe in general in the coming years cib delivered another very strong excellent quarter in the coming quarters we expect to continue to gain market share increasing revenue through excellent dynamics in structured finance and project finance transaction volumes and markets where we are protecting the value of our trading books wealth management insurance despite market volatility results grew in private banking we had a new net money inflows of billion in asset management profits rose and in insurance gross written premiums grows looking forward we expect to maintain doubledigit growth in profit contribution across the three businesses in pagonxt total revenue in the first half surged yearonyear on the back of our four main business segments especially merchants and trade activities have all been very well and we believe we will meet our plus revenue target for the whole year finally in cards we managed million cards throughout the group and revenue grew yearonyear to circa billion but with doubledigit growth in america and europe we expect to continue to grow turnover and revenue at highdouble digits in the coming months let me now turn it back to josé antonio for his closing remarks josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa thank you josé allow me to try to guide you to take a look forward how do we see the group evolving in the coming quarters so on one side on the revenue side we have a environment in which nii should increase in the coming quarters benefiting mainly from interest rate hikes normal interest rate hikes take for a while to show up in the pl it starts accelerate later on and with respect to activity levels we expect a significant acceleration of the revenues particularly in you will see some of these we are already seeing some of these clearly in poland and uk where rates set to go up faster and we will see next year basically a strong acceleration significant acceleration on the back of high rates in europe and also in mexico and in other countries so fee income josé mentioned how our fee income generating business are evolving you saw both wealth management insurance and cib that are the main fee income generators we are gaining share clearly in the cib space that is performing very well and we are also doing very well in private banking and insurance where we think that we can grow wealth management insurance well into double digits so for that reason i am relatively optimistic about the commercial activity fee income generate that generates fee income so positive on revenues and costs while we face clearly a higher inflation ph not the one we were expecting but while we have a track record and we continue to think that were going to be able to increase the productivity and to evolve really the cost well below the inflation as we are doing quarter after quarter naturally some of the inflation is going to go through the cost base particularly in those countries with high inflation but we feel that the productivity gains and cost management will allow us cost grow well below inflation in asset quality a decent margin as you know indiscernible probably some numbers yesterday or the day before yesterday i dont remember exactly and where theres an erosion of the expectations on the gdp banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 and natural in this environment the discussion is if there is a recession coming or not some of these credit quality duration as you know ifrs require us to anticipate potential deterioration in the first half of the year we already done in our provisions some of these around million or something like that for deterioration but we see our given our loan portfolio structure the high household saving rates the low unemployment rates and the resilient real estate prices as our protection in our portfolio for this year we feel comfortable that were going to be inside our range that we gave to you less than we are running up basis points and we feel comfortable with our target for the year in capital our commitment is to stay at or above in every quarter and having disciplined capital allocation and well reflect this in the higher profitability so we are there and the capital generation of the group other than the marktomarket of held to collect and sales has been good in the quarter and my impression is that continue to be good and will continue generating capital on a continuous basis and this will translate into our shareholders where our commitment is to have a payout for this year although we hope to increase closer to in the future once the that is what we communicated to you in our shareholders meeting so well just to reiterate our commitments for the year both in terms of depreciation return on tangible equity and core equity tier we feel comfortable we feel that we can reach those targets this year and for the future i think that the revenue increase will be more than will offset the potential higher costs and potential increase on cost of risks so im positive on the capacity of the group to regenerate profits in the future thats it now we remain at your disposal for the questions you may have begoña morenés global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé and josé antonio well open now the floor for any questions banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions we already have our first question from ignacio ulargui from bnp paribas exane please go ahead our next question is coming from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc hi hi good morning hopefully you can hear me ive got two questions one on brazil and another clarification on your last comments on capital on brazil i heard josé mentioned that you keep the to cost of risk but if i look at  standalone cost of risk i think its basis points and it looks like to achieve your guidance for the full year in the second half youd need to be below basis points so i just want to make sure ive understood the guidance correctly and maybe you can give a bit of color whats going on because its probably a steeper increase than we were expecting although you had flagged that the peak will be in  but maybe a bit of color on whats going on and if i got those numbers right and the second question on capital the you mentioned josé antonio is that can we expect that already in or another way to ask it is there anything we need to take into account that might prevent you from raising it to ie remaining capital indiscernible i think for you already said there isnt any left but i dont know if theres anything in the second half conscious that banamex is no longer on the table so i just cant see any reason why you shouldnt increase it to thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay thanks alvaro for your questions on brazil well josé already elaborate on this allow me to go in more details as josé said we are seeing a increase in cost of risk in the consumer mass market portfolio youre right ph i said in the second quarter was higher than in the first quarter having said that we remain comfortable with the guidance we gave to you its true that we saw already in june better results than we saw in the third in the three or four previous months and we remain constructive and within that we are in control of these to remain in this range as you know we reduced the lending last year josé already mentioned that our exposure to the most the overdraft that is the part of the higher cost of risk has been reduced and we feel comfortable with our expectations for the year mainly taking into account that brazil has been one of the few countries in which expectations for gdp growth have been improved by the imf yeah so the situation in the country indiscernible we face selections by october but in general we see the situation for a more constructive point of view and we think that with the measures we took and with the trends we are seeing were going to stick with this cost of risk for the whole year we are not seeing any sign of deterioration other than the ones we saw before so we are seeing the corporate book performing very well we are seeing including smes and is remains related with the individual portfolio consumer and inside the consumer auto portfolio improves already its more unsecured consumer that is still causing this spike in the cost of risk banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 and second question well its true that we dont or we said that we dont have headwinds going forward in our capital what im stating here is what we are stating at the agm the intention of the board to go to when is this going to happen well its up to the board i am not in a position to anticipate the decision that is going to be taken by the board but this is the clear intention of the group is to go back to these levels and continue to use the buybacks and the combination of buybacks and cash dividend as we done in the last year josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa if i may give you a bit of color about the regulatory charges in the second half in the first half we had basis points in the first quarter the plus basis points in the second quarter has two components its plus basis points from the nonperforming loan but still a difference and minus basis points from models so from pure regulatory we have an around basis points basis points already accounted for and we would expect another basis points basis points in the second half so very much in line with the guidance we gave you at the beginning of the year for basis points or basis points total regulatory charges in the year as a whole alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc okay thank you for that clarification josé begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you alvaro can we have the next question please operator the next question is coming from ignacio ulargui please go ahead ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas hi you hear me now josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa very well indeed ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas okay perfect thanks very much sorry for the problem before just have one followup question on mexico just following the sort of like the outcome of banamex what is the strategy plan to follow there and what are the priorities for the bank in terms of organic growth in which indiscernible that you can gain market share and the other question is on cost of risk at a group level i mean you have given a bit of a comfort about brazil but i mean is there sort of like any other market where you think that they could be sort of like would you envisage some deterioration that could put a risk that below basis points cost of risk guidance for thank you banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay thank you ignacio for your question in mexico indiscernible well as you rightly said and we communicated to the market indiscernible organic growth when we look at our franchise in mexico we have overall market share in upscale to compete efficiently in our market and no doubt about this when you look in more detail where were going to focus were going to focus more on individuals so when you look at the market shares all across its true that we our market share in the corporate space is higher than it is in the individual space particularly on the for the division the organic growth its going to be focusing growing the customer base individual but it should split through in the balance sheet through a larger deposit base individuals deposit base i mean and through a larger share particularly on the consumer we are growing in auto we started three years ago weve got already market share and were going to continue to grow in the consumer space but also in credit cards where we launched in september last year a new card that is selling cards a month and we are growing well there and we expect the growth to accelerate its accelerating if you look at the numbers at the balance sheet that the pl is accelerating and we continue we expect to continue to this acceleration so in short were going to focus more on the individual side where we need to grow the deposit base and also in the consumer finance space and credit cards in mortgage market our market share is around where were up of our average market we are doing well there but those are going to be the focus if you remember here a little bit the situation we faced in brazil a couple of years ago when bradesco bought hsbc and on the back of these we were able to gain or percentage point market share in brazil in a very difficult time in brazil at that time brazil was in recession at that time and we were able to profit from this situation and we expect we are doing already on the back of the process now and we expect to continue to do in the coming years second question cost of risk more general question not that much focused in brazil as your colleague alvaro i already elaborated on brazil you mentioned other markets other markets the cost of risk is going up in brazil for the situation i explained and is going up also in the us its back to normal in the us yeah in the us in the cost of risk was abnormally low well below expected across the cycle and we are in some kind of normalization its going according with our plans well you know that the cost of risk largely depends on the auto market and the auto market remains in a situation that is not i dont know how to qualify not normal in the sense that the availability of new cars is not there and the used car prices remain at the alltime highs i think and this situation creates a market where the cost of risk is still up unemployment is very low well and inflation helps to pay the bills in the short run and this will get the for the time being the normalization is going to happen little by little in the us but this is the other marketing when you go to the numbers you see the cost of risk going up in all the other markets i dont see any sign of deterioration quite the opposite in spain we are trending down we expect to continue to go down this year and next year in consumer we are not seeing any sign across the board im referring now to consumers in europe in mexico we feel very comfortable with the portfolio in chile we also feel very comfortable with the portfolio so i dont see any deterioration in the portfolios and in fact npls are trending down remember that the npls now around taking into account that there is a changing criteria within the definition before likeforlike we are compared with last year these periods are around 280something so and still trending down we are not seeing signs of deterioration there well maybe i should elaborate because i mentioned in the previous quarters around eco loans remember that in the previous quarter we were discussing uncertainties around the eco loans with extension we did last year for banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 one year those loans matured start to pay normal installments in aprilmay and i should say that it came i should say significantly much better than expected so initial areas were below and this is significantly better than at least my expectations yeah and the uncertainty what i was showing you so thats the situation our models have high sensitivity as you know we provide or based it on ifrs and the models apply in ifrs rule rules i mentioned that provisions in the first half million were due to market conditions the changing to picking the new macro conditions for the future and these were mainly in spain like million due to market conditions in uk like million million and the us million so those are provisions that are there due to change in the market conditions not reflecting any kind of deterioration in the portfolio i think i expect to clarify a little bit with the issue of the cost of risk begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you thank you ignacio can we have the next question please operator the next question is coming from pamela zuluaga from credit suisse pamela zuluaga q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd good morning thank you for taking my questions the first one is again around capital so most of the organic capital that you keep on generating has been offset by fair valuation adjustments from your bond portfolios are you thinking about maybe changing your risk allocation strategy shifting your accounting towards held to maturity for bonds in order to somehow shield capital better how should we think about this risk moving forward because thinking about the pending regulatory impacts that you were guiding for could we therefore expect some further risks to capital if market dynamics continue weighing on valuations and then the second question is on poland do you have any estimates on the potential impact from mortgage moratoria in poland because we already have confirmation that four of those months are going to happen this year and four next year and then should we continue to expect further provisioning in poland related to the fx denominated mortgages thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay thank you pamela for your questions in capital organic your question is related to held to collect and sale well what happens with this portfolio with our portfolios are relatively short duration so the portfolios is in the region of billion i think the duration josé probably you have you can give the duration of the portfolio we are not we took a chance on our capital of basis points in the first half of the year due to the held to collect and sell marktomarket portfolio we are not in a hurry to change this reclassification we know that if we reclassify you get back basis points but while at the same time the duration is short and is going as long as if the rates remain stable its feeding through the pl yeah monthaftermonth and quarterafterquarter and well get ph review significantly rates remain as they are today naturally if they go one way or another well this affect the pl but we are not we dont feel that we are not in a hurry given the size of the portfolio and the duration to do something as you suggest i dont know josé if you want to comment on this josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 yeah just a little bit more detail on this of the billion alco portfolio billion is held to collect and sale and only billion billion billion is held to collect so we have most of our portfolio in markto market of these as josé antonio said has a duration of less than two years so for instance in poland is one year in mexico is years so very very short time duration less than two years so the impact of this potential further deterioration with this duration is going to be significantly less going forward than it has been so far josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay the second question is in poland if i understood you well youre asking two questions one is about mortgage moratoria and the other one is a fx swiss franc provision for mortgages in relation with the first one what has been published recently and what weve done is assuming take up of all the portfolio is going to be an impact of pln billion yeah so that means in euros i dont know million or 200something they likely they likely not once we have destinations this is going to be charged in the third quarter in our pl in poland so the figure is slightly below million for fx we are now at if i am right coverage well do we need to top up well see the market is around so we are there its not going to be significant but maybe that we need to top up depending on how the litigations go how many customers go to courts and how many customers we negotiate directly with them a potential compensation here but i dont rule out to go to to so but in any case its of a portfolio of billion or something like that so in euros its like million million yeah i hope i answered all your questions begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you pamela can we have the next question please operator the next question is coming from sofie peterzens from jpmorgan sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi here is sofie from jpmorgan thanks for taking my question so my first one would be on the proposed spanish banking tax do you have any additional comments that you can make what the potential impact on you will be and will it only be on your spanish operations or also on your international operations and then my second question would be a little bit a followup on the alco portfolio could you just remind us how much alco bonds do you have in spain and kind of over time where you indiscernible alco portfolio level so how much could you potentially increase that alco portfolio by and then just a followup question on mexico can you just clarify why you walked away from the banamex transaction thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay spanish banking tax unfortunately i have no idea yeah at this moment at this point of time so i was told that the rumor in the media is that this morning the same morning were going to have a kind of presentation because this is a presentation for in the parliament for the paris coming from the paris this is the way they banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 match this and we want to know this same morning if this affects spanish operations our global operation side i have no idea i do expect that this affect spanish operations but well see what happens when this is presented to the parliament today alco in spain we dont have alco in spain zero we dont have bonds youre asking me for the level of potential alco portfolio well if i look at the we have a negative duration of five years in the balance sheet in spain if you were to offset all of this the portfolio will be very very large yeah so you can do the maths here on but will be very large but what seems to me is a reasonable alco portfolio for spain is to put the duration of the balance sheet between the minus two and plus two years yeah that is normally where we imagine the portfolio is set in extraordinary times when the rates went into negative territory were going to reconstruct this portfolio little by little depending on our view on the market and trying to put the balance sheet with a less negative duration we havent started but we will for sure start at some point when we think its the appropriate time banamex well as you know weve been very transparent on this were interested in the asset we put the conditions one of the conditions were the price naturally the price the return on investment was in commissions not to issue shares so we told you openly we submit a nonbinding offer and well we were told that we are not going to continue in the process thats it there is no more to us yeah so we were disciplined and well as i said before to your colleague before we think that we have we put a price asking for a return on investment attractive for our shareholders knowing that we have a good chance of gaining market share in the new situation and growing organically and adding several percentage points of market share in mexico with our shift in franchise begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you sofie can we have the next question please operator the next question is coming from benjie creelansandford from jefferies please go ahead benjie creelansandford q analyst jefferies international ltd yes good morning everyone thanks for taking the questions i had two questions on the revenue outlook please first of all just on the digital consumer bank i guess looking in the quarter volumes are going up but margins are going down so im just wondering if you could discuss a little bit about what youre seeing in terms of consumer loan demand across the european business how are clients reacting to cost of living pressures versus what are still very good employment trends and in terms of margins in the consumer business there are lag effects in terms of asset repricing that is weighing on margins or are you seeing increasing pricing competition in that segment the second question was just a clarification on brazil and the nii outlook in the second half of the year so i understood that you expect the sort of the repricing or the rate repricing to sort of level out in the so should we assume that nii will be down sequentially in again and perhaps if you could just be a bit more precise or offer any more guidance around kind of the rebound because the lag effect in the rate repricing runs off into i know you give guidance on the rate sensitivity on a yearone basis can you give any indication of what that rate sensitivity looks like on the yeartwo basis in brazil thank you banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay the first question allow me to elaborate on digital consumer bank consumer loan demand in europe the consumer loan demand is not bad i should say its good yeah so the problem with our portfolio here is basically billion of which billion or north of billion is related with auto and the remaining is basically that ph declining on point of sale we are seeing good trends in bulk business but lead times in the auto industry are getting very very long to give you a proxy of this normally we have a stock finance that we fund the inventory of the cars dealers normally in the region of billion to billion now this is running at half of this is billion billion this tells you an indication where the industry is in the capacity to deliver the demand they have on the other side i mentioned for the us but the same happens in europe the activity in used car markets and the price in used car markets is strong our origination this year were going to go to the billion mark this is where our originations are growing but this is because we are gaining share okay the market is not there car sales are falling significantly what happens is we are gaining share all across and for that reason we are growing in originations the second question this is the situation of the market the second question was more margin and pricing this business ph led me to start with the balance sheet of this business this business as i have said close to billion loan book the majority of this fixed rate normally with a duration of around two years yeah funded indiscernible combination of deposits in the region of billion and the rest is wholesale funding normally issuance and securitizations and other things while we tend to have relatively very low interest rate risk in this business what is happening with the margins yields are going up not at the state of what is happening in the ph swap year card but this is the usual factor that this business follow normally started to go up a couple of months ago more so in countries in which the rates went up faster before like the uk and the other markets are following and i dont see a path of now differently than the one i was expecting yeah so normally this business suffer a little bit not that much because the combination of deposits and wholesale funding the majority of this with around two years duration we cant accommodate the majority of this and not to suffer that much on the margin side the fee income is doing well on the other side on the back of indiscernible activity and if the activity recovers i do not expect this significant margin compression there indiscernible we cannot pass the very first day we pass over a period of three four months the new prices to the new origination in brazil you mentioned the outlook the fourth quarter and rebound in brazil when the rebound is going to happen josé gave you some indications of this basically what happens in brazil as long as rates go up so let me explain the nii in brazil nii in brazil in the loan book is going up it went up has been going up in the marketrelated activities collapsed and went into negative territory remained the rates went from to when this is going to turn around so normally when you finish the tightening cycle it takes around two quarters yeah to go up okay so we think that we are close to the peak but we will see we think that its a couple of basis points still to come from the central bank of brazil probably basis points probably basis points i dont know in this region and two quarters afterwards were going to show up this in nii yeah jose mentioned for the rebound expecting that with the central bank rates in the official rate in brazil peaks augustseptember this year okay so this is our outlook for brazil banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 having said that the customer business so the loan book the spread of the loan book is going up but the financial activities went from positive territory to negative territory this year and main swing we have there this is going to fade away as long as the portfolio mature and renew all these things yeah those are the dynamics in brazil benjie creelansandford q analyst jefferies international ltd thank you begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé antonio and thank you benjie for your question can we have the next one please operator the next question is coming from ignacio cerezo from ubs please go ahead ignacio cerezo q analyst ubs ag london branch yeah hi good morning thank you for the presentation i have two questions on the us both around asset quality so if you can kind of let us know your view about what we need to monitor to gauge when and how quickly asset quality kind of start deteriorating if its unemployment like you were mentioning the european consumer finance operation or youre also concerned around collateral prices going down and reversing then the peak that we have seen the last couple of years and the second question around this is i mean obviously the units will pay and they have been blended into one i mean we dont have the disclosure between scusa and the rest of the bank any longer and there has been significant changes on the mix of scusa in recent years as well so its difficult for us actually to have a kind of a realistic view about this throughthecycle cost of risk for the unit so if you can share with us basically the view you have on where can actually cost of risk in the us land in a normal environment thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay the first question about asset quality what we are looking when this start deteriorating naturally unemployment rate is one of the key drivers also in the us you mentioned us what is going on let me provide you a little bit whats going on in scusa in terms of the dynamics of the business now we are seeing a significant we are generating in the loan book with a cycle that is points above what we were generating one year ago so this is ph by generating this the pricing model is quite sophisticated and goes along with the cycles scusa are generating so this explain a little bit the trend changes there second leasing business now the dynamics are different from any time we have seen before normally leasing businesses works in a way that the customers take the car and three years later or four years later they give us back the car and we dispose the car in an auction to the market and this process in normal times is a process that produce very little profits very little losses yeah what has happened around this period is in this was a very profitable business in on the back of very high second half used car market price but in what we are seeing is the customers are not returning back the cars to us they prefer to selling their own given the high prices prevailing in the used car markets and this banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 changed the dynamics in the pl ph thats the reason that you see that the i think its in the other income you see a significant decrease in the other income due to this phenomenon last year we made out of this million indiscernible we are making very little out of this process asset quality we expect we traditionally we were around 4somethingpercent in scusa in the cost of risk less than and now the cost of risk in us the whole us is so what the bank is you split between the bank the bank has very low cost of risk ph meaning less and all the cost of risk you have seen now the comes from scusa okay this normalization will happen over time and depends not necessarily ph bet on the past as we are generating higher indiscernible we also expect lower cost of risk when the unemployment deteriorating unemployment continues to be the main driver not as much interest rates remember that we are lending a very high ph gil and the impact of additional basis points or or basis points in the ph gil is not meaningful when you are lending at or something like that so indiscernible is not as important as it is in the prime space where the changes in rates can produce more significant changes in the monthly installments i think i answered your questions yeah begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé antonio and thank you ignacio for your questions can we have the next question please operator the next question is coming from carlos peixoto from caixabank please go ahead carlos peixoto q analyst caixabank bpi yes hi hi good morning so a couple of questions from my side as well first is just something well the first one is related to followup indiscernible if i missed exactly the guidance that you have given for nii in brazil for the full year and on the second question was i mean on the outlook for cost of risk in spain i believe that in the past you have mentioned something in the areas of basis points right now cost of risk is still trending a bit above those levels i was wondering how you see it for the second half of the year and possibly into indiscernible thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa so nii in brazil you have a so a midsingle digit growth in brazil is what you should expect for nii in brazil for the whole year yeah while the cost of risk in spain hasnt changed our expectations we said basis points to basis points for the whole year probably this is what you should expect for spain this year well naturally this means as you know the cost of risk now largely depends on the macro scenarios yeah and well i told you that million in the first half came from the macro while the second half the macro is so uncertain in these days that well we will see what kind of macro we introduce at the end of the year but if the macro remains as it is today lets take imf expectations that they published yesterday or a day before yesterday it should stay in these levels yeah so as i said to you before we do not expect a big deal this year on the ground coming from the cost of risk yeah banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé antonio and thank you carlos for your questions can we have the next one please operator the next question is coming from andrea filtri from mediobanca please go ahead andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom thank you two questions one on rate sensitivity this is the flavor of the moment but the visibility youre giving is still quite low compared to other names can you please give us for each main area your 12month rate sensitivity assuming zero deposits beta that you plugged in the forward curve that we can all see just to add some transparency on that front and i didnt understand quite well before josé antonio your elaboration around the reason not to have any spanish bonds alco portfolio in spain and how big the alco should be in a normalized scenario the second question is on brazil again on the rate sensitivity you elaborated quite a lot around this but i wanted to understand in brazilian reals term what you would expect then to be the tailwind on a full phasing when the liability repricing stops and the asset repricing of the current rates level is completed to understand the ph swing independent on from the negative headwind to the positive tailwind and hence how much can be stay in terms of cost of risk thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay let me to elaborate josé will guide you to the specific details on the numbers you see sensitivity to rates yeah so were going to give you and its in the presentation the indiscernible high level i should say that with the indiscernible normally what happens is this is a process that is accelerating so if i take the call with the forward rates probably in europe we should think that our business in europe billion north of billion probably this is a figure that well you know theres plenty of numbers there but this is a figure that sounds reasonable to me you asked for the spanish alco well indiscernible for having an alco between billion and billion is something that sounds to me reasonable too alco does not necessarily mean one single indiscernible it means a portfolio of fixed rate assets that we do not generate in commercial terms in commercial terms as you know while the majority of our of the mortgage book the majority of the lending to smes and corporates and of the lending to cib or almost of the lending to cib is floating rate so on the other way around is ph unlimited asset that we generate a fixed rate and for that reason the need of having a significant alco portfolio in spain that we dont have because our view of our interest rates was that they should go up and thats the reason why we dont have this portfolio josé you want to clarify the specific data josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah the reason we give a parallel shift well parallel shift really its from day to months this is activity we have doesnt go beyond months obviously so when we talk about a parallel shift we are talking about a movement between overnight and months and the reason we give a parallel shift is because today for banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 instance the market is expecting rates in europe to stay at while just a month ago it was much higher than that so its much better to look at sensitivity and then for a parallel shift which is again a movement between a day and months and then you put your own outlook of rates but for the parallel shift of basis points and a beta the sensitivity in spain is million in the uk is million most of which we have already seen by the way so in the uk we would expect further sensitivity in the second half of this year and then probably some stabilization in million in the us for the second year this is relevant for brazil and in brazil in the second year we would expect a positive sensitivity of around million so if we are right and then the last interest rate hike explains in august september and then we start seeing the positive sensitivity flowing through the pl in brazil towards the end of this year beginning of next year then we should see this sensitivity in the pl in brazil which is around million million this sensitivity to a parallel shift is in the presentation thank you andrea begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé and josé antonio and thank you andrea for your question can we have the next one please operator operator instructions and the next question is coming from carlos cobo catena from société générale please go ahead carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain hi thank you very much for taking my questions a couple of questions from me one is on ma appetite now that you rule out mexico theres been some reports in the media about you exploring some agreements or expanding the agreements with carmakers in europe youve always been very interested in your indiscernible business so could that be an area where you could do some bolton deals and how materials if you could quantify that they might be in terms of capital consumption if its possible to give a indiscernible and then i understand theres been some popups in the macro provisions overlay could you elaborate on which countries youve been in which countries youve allocated that provision indiscernible arent really talking about covid overlay so it would be interesting to see what if you differ from them and thats it thats my two questions thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa thank you carlos well ma appetite well we are not looking what you mentioned is agreement with oems well we look at this as much as a bau if you look backwards in the last year we signed three important deals the main one was stellantis that was a restructuring of the previous deal that will bring to us our portfolio as a result of this will grow in the region of billion and we did an agreement with stellantis we reached another important agreement with mitsubishi to be the provider in the us and wed done another agreement very important this one with honda in mexico to be the provider for honda in mexico naturally we have this plenty of discussions in some cases for one country in some cases for one country and some cases for the whole europe probably we have several of those open but nothing that i can communicate at this stage banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 because but i see this as a bau for the division of the car consumer finance reaching agreements with the oems means in some cases that we establish a joint venture with them in which we match the financial side and then match the commercial side of the joint venture or providing white label to them and provide our services here we agreed in this i forgot to mention that we also reached an agreement in greece last year with the main importer in greece that has market share but this is as i should say business as usual and is in our projections that we gave for the business as usual in the digital consumer bank space the provisions indiscernible i said before while this is million is roughly speaking numbers million in spain million in uk and million in us so those are the million that you have embedded due to macro in their first half results begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé antonio and thank you carlos for your question can we have the last question please operator the last question is coming from britta schmidt from autonomous research please go ahead britta schmidt q analyst autonomous research llp yeah josé good morning ive got two questions please one is on the rate outlook for brazil the consensus expects that there will be rate cuts in and maybe you can help us walk through the dynamics of your nii outlook then would we see even wider spreads at the end of second half of depending of course on the timing and my second question will be on poland do you have any update on the wibor issues there do you expect this surge to become a legal case and drag on whats the latest from the ground thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa in the rate outlook for brazil we expect the rates to pick further sooner than later but maybe ph never maybe september this year and well when the rates start to go down more difficult to say but as you know in the indiscernible the cfo already elaborate on this normally you should expect a one two quarters negative or positive and afterwards the commercial dynamics prevail yeah so but overall those are the dynamics and what you should expect from nii and this is the outlook for rates in brazil well still highly uncertain next year yeah poland youre asking me if this is a legal case its too early to tell well naturally were as of today were analyzing the situation i provide you the impact assuming a takeup on the mortgage moratoria this is a significant damage for the system as a whole and while our colleagues the indiscernible in poland will take a view on this and while this is not an unusual case this is a whole financial community in poland that should take the appropriate view on this when we finish to analyze the proposal from the government josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 yeah if i may add in terms of the wibor we just know that theres a proposal to change it but we dont have the details it will start next year but there are no details at all with regards to the change in the wibor it will be very difficult to change the index josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa yeah josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa i know you want to elaborate but it would go against recommendations for index regulation in europe so it would be very difficult to change but we have no news josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa the proposal is difficult to execute as josé said its european regulations indiscernible this way and thats the situation we did not expect any news soon on this okay begoña morenés global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé and josé antonio there are no further questions josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa thank you guys and take care josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division
