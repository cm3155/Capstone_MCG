banco santander sa thank you very much begoña and good morning to everybody its great to be with you all and thank you for joining us so as begoña said and as an introduction to our results i would like to provide you with some context of what we have achieved since our resilient business model has allowed us to grow to increase our balance sheet strength our profitability and deliver attractive shareholder returns again key elements continue to be our scale our diversification and our customer focus all of which remain a source of strength of more predictable and earnings results through the cycle in fact if you look back years our earnings per share presents the lowest volatility the lowest volatility versus our peers and growing results and this is again a key attractiveness of our business model so we have laid these foundations to deliver great value to service a growing customer base which is up million customers since increasing profits improving profitability our rote is up close basis points since and of course strengthening our capital base in a very significant way as well as delivering sustainable returns to our shareholders just a couple of numbers on this we have remunerated shareholders with billion since and our tangible now has grown by billion since then so im very pleased to report that a strong takes us very close to meeting our investor day targets in spite of the pandemia actually in some cases were ahead and we will continue to focus on growth profitability strength including shareholder remuneration we are guiding for a midsingledigit revenue growth costincome close to and return on tangible equity above and were aiming to keep our cet1 fully loaded at around were also aiming to keep the payout in of which as we already said will be share buybacks and the other in cash banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 i also want to say that longer term we aspire to increase our total shareholder remuneration beyond the to around again through share buybacks and growing our cash dividend whilst maintaining a cet1 of this would be of course subject to future corporate and regulatory decisions and approvals so if we go to the next slide youve seen very strong results our net profit is actually up from underlying in a similar percentage reflect as i said the strength and resilience of our business model we onboarded million new customers we are growing revenues by to over billion we again increased efficiency and reduced the cost of credit thats down to just basis points and generating a return to shareholders as measured by tangible nav per share and cash dividend per share of importantly was a pivotal year for us in terms of capital we are at the high end of the range delivering a cet1 fully loaded and going forward as i already said we expect to keep it at these levels of so you can heres our pl here we have been able to recover actually more than recover our prepandemic levels of customer activity in terms of the underlying profit before tax again its a record high of billion actually on the quarter is the highest underlying in years and this is up our underlying profit about billion thats up versus last year compared to and again this reflects optimal cost of risk but also very strong execution of what i have said many times is a structural change in our business model very importantly as you can see revenues are growing more than cost with a positive operating leverage very strong capital generation in the year and up to cet1 of even though we had significant regulatory headwinds this year even more important is the strong business momentum and you can see some examples here we are moving our business model to more fees diversifying into different sources of revenues linked to our customer focus these are only some examples loans and deposits are growing mutual funds are growing at but in the higher return valueadded services which are really whats adding to our profitability our pos point of sale up insurance premiums up our new buy now pay later this is a business weve built on top of our tech stack openbank in germany is going across europe soon million customers in the first few months debt capital markets ma fees up this is really important for the future and these are the businesses in which were investing more heavily josé antonio will give you details later on the regions during the year we also leveraged the diversification and scale of the group these are two key elements and were working more and more in this key strength of our business model so our operational performance is improving across the board europe north america south america our digital consumer bank which as you know combines our auto and consumer finance and openbank is one of our important growth initiatives in europe we are working really hard to transform the business model return on tangible is close to as you can see in the slide our customer focus is also showing up in better nps across the different countries and again the structural changes have led to cost efficiencies of around billion and this is an area well continue to focus on for next year north america we generated a return on tangible equity of close to we are working also in a structural basis in the us ill give you more details later on and really trying very hard to leverage the connectivity across the group our experience in consumer finance in europe and latin america and other relationships that are global banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 corporate investment banking also have made great progress in north america and in mexico we are increasing profitability and being very successful in growing new business like the auto business organically south america again a standout performer with chile and brazil being the best bank in terms of profitability in their respective markets and overall returns of were growing doubledigit in terms of revenues growing in terms of market share and growing customers in very different segments in all these markets our digital consumer bank again very strong year producing a return on tangible equity of around i would like to point to two key numbers in this slide if you look at the groups customer loans and group underlying profit you can see europe is where we have of our loans and of our profits again this means our business is more dependent on lending in europe this is something were working on to increase fees and increase profitability it also means reduced risk as a lot of these loans are secured on mortgages in countries like the uk and spain south america on the contrary you can see customer loans underlying profit this is exactly the example of very positive operating leverage very diversified businesses many of them highgrowth fee businesses linked to digital initiatives like auto platforms getnet and other such businesses same in north america as you can see of the loans and of the profits we have been leading and intend to continue to lead on the responsible banking and here we have very specific targets in terms of our green transition for us and our customers building a more inclusive society and of course talent and diversity so in terms of the green transition we are working with our customers to help them in that transition we are focused on delivering on our own net zero ambition by which of course includes our customers in terms of our own operations we are already net zero and we are working again on the advisory side on the capital markets but also increasingly developing retail and sme products we originated billion in green finance in we have billion under management and were the number one bank in project finance in renewable energy but we are again making a lot of progress in our very important goal of empowering million individuals by were on target to reach that weve empowered million people in and also allocated million in microfinance in as i said before were very very focused and proud to have been number one bank in bloomberg genderequality index and number two company worldwide and this is an area where well continue to focus as we think diversity is not just the right thing its also good for business so in summary responsible banking we believe is key to delivering on all our other commitments we are creating value for our shareholders we did set a payout of underlying earnings split in equal parts between cash dividends and also buyback programs well be announcing in a couple of weeks the second dividend after the interim dividend of sic billion which was half and half between cash and buybacks we continue to believe buybacks are an excellent investment of our capital and so that would be the intention for the second dividend as well so i will now pass over to josé antonio whos going to review the regions and detailed operating metrics for the year banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa thank you ana and good morning to everyone as ana has already commented we recorded a pretty strong set of results in with an underlying profit of billion higher yearonyear in constant euros driven by a very positive performance across the board notably in us uk brazil and the cib and wealth management businesses our net operating income preprovision profit was around billion with an increase of yearonyear what i think is remarkable this was driven by a revenue growth net interest income grew on the back of higher volumes lower cost of funds better credit spreads in latin america and starting some positive impacts from recent interest rate hikes in some latin american countries and poland net fee income rose yearonyear doubledigit growth in corporates wholesale banking and wealth management insurance due to greater commercial and financial activity cost increased half of the pace of the revenue what has driven significant efficiency improvements the significant fall in loan loss provision across the group accelerated in  driven by the improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and the very positive performance of our main portfolios if we look one step down in the pl and we analyze the quarterly trends in core lines we saw improving trends across the board on the pl lines through the year  was the profit was the highest of of billion after a good behavior particularly on the provisioning side but also some of the releases were offset for the contribution to deposit guarantee fund bank levy the charge for the swiss francs in poland so netnet the quarter is fairly comparable with the previous ones in more detail sustained customer revenue growth plus nii and fee income quarteronquarter driven by greater volumes initial impact following the rate hikes as i mentioned before and growth in higher valueadded products and services qonq increasing cost is almost fully explained by bonus adjustments so this not does not represent a running rate for the coming year in addition a lower loan loss provision in  favored therefore mentioned provisioning release i will run through the cost and provisions in more details in the following slides on the cost side we have seen significant inflationary pressure around the world group cost rose in constant euros but were lower in real terms absorbing higher it expenses digital developments increased activity and labor agreements that particularly affected in the second part of the year our efficiency ratio improved to circa this was basically driven by europe minus full percentage points which recorded the highest efficiency gains i should stress that the cost in spain went down in portugal and uk also decreased this is more to come in and our running rate will decrease in line with our targets for the region we continue to make a structural change to our operating model to drive new improvements in productivity which should enable us to maintain cost growth below inflation and further improve our efficiency rate so on the credit quality the balance sheet remains i would say robust npl ratio of below and provisions down in constant euros partly due to the release in provisions in  we also reduced significantly cost of credit it was mentioned already by ana to basis points below and levels and exceeds our initial target in we expect to maintain the cost of credit below our banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 ratio through the cycle spain could be key as we expect its cost of credit to reduce to approximately basis points offsetting some normalization in the us and uk finally on capital in we reached a fully loaded core equity tier thanks to the strong operating results we delivered quarteroverquarter in  we generated basis points organically a combination of net profit net of dividends and also the efficient riskweighted asset management that the riskweighted assets were flat in the quarter negative impacts in the quarter of basis points due to small regulatory impacts we already spoke about this in the previous quarter basis points due to market movements affecting some alco portfolios and basis points from the minority interest in mexico it could include the acquisition of scusa that was approved this same week was executed this same week indiscernible of basis points we closed at 31st of january and the announced acquisition of the brokerdealer amherst pierpont that affect basis points which is still subject to completion which will have an impact of basis points and our pro forma cet1 ratio will stand at we were able to combine this performance with an increase in the tangible net asset value per share looking at the regions and starting with europe we are accelerating our business transformation its where we are pushing harder in changing our operating model profit doubled in the region reaching billion with higher profitability due to volumes indiscernible particularly mortgage in line with economic recovery net operating income supported by wider jobs in most countries revenue was up particularly customer revenue while costs were flat due to ongoing efficiency gains reduction in loan loss provision and our cost of credit improved to basis points in the following slides for the sake of clarity i include the return on tangible equity side adjusted to the core equity tier in all the units due to the fact that in order to have a likeforlike comparison between the units and given the fact that they have very different capital ratios we are making this adjustment so in europe starting with spain spain saw a strong pickup in activity in individuals mortgages consumer lending customer funds also reduced significantly last year profit nearly doubled boosted by strong net operating income performance jaws of full percentage points revenue grew and efficiency gains drove reduction in costs loan loss provisions reduced yearonyear and in we expect to have our cost of credit so as we expect a singledigit balance sheet out in in uk we improved fourfold theres a fourfold increase in profit basically by record net mortgage lending you dont see these in the loan book that only grows due to the fact that we completed the transfer of the cib business to the london branch and this affect some of the loan portfolio went from the ringfenced bank to the london branch plus yearonyear growth in nii due to the deposit repricing and volumes on the mortgage that i mentioned before cost savings from our transformation program partially offset by it investments and regulatoryrelated programs efficiency improved by nearly full percentage points loan loss provision releases reflecting balance sheet strength as a result we achieved doubledigit return on tangible equity in the uk north america we improved our competitive position weve been increasing connectivity in the region consolidating it functions and advancing significantly in the business simplification we also announced several transactions in in line with our strategy to deploy capital in the most profitable business volumes grew driven by our main segments in both countries profit doubled driven largely by lower provisions and higher revenue in the us banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 in the us we had extremely positive on a likeforlike basis excluding puerto rico and bluestem portfolio disposals along with doubledigit growth in auto originations customer fund increased due to retail deposits with a significantly lower cost of funding underlying profit increased sharply supported by the increase in net operating income the nii fees and auto lease results and decline in loan loss provisions in short strong performance with us being one of the ph genes of the group in results mexico we increased our stake to over due to investing the franchise reflecting positive results and customer growth in a challenged environment rate cuts in and falling volumes we were able to quickly adapt resulting in improving trends during the year as a result we delivered increase in profit thanks to the loan and deposit growth control cost well below inflation despite it investments and better cost of credit finally the region south america well continue to strengthen connectivity we are market leader across the region we are capturing synergies across the region and new business opportunities and boosting our already profitable franchise we show strong customer growth in all the countries where we are leader in quality of service as we measure in nps in terms of results in we delivered greater volumes in all countries doubledigit customer revenue growth increased productivity with costs growing well below inflation and lower cost of credit in all our countries they resulted in strong profit and very high return on tangible equity in brazil another excellent year record customer attraction more than million customers with some leading to a significant growth in loans to individual growing at consumer finance and smes plus this translate into the pl with a return on tangible equity well above doubledigit growth in customer revenue and record annual efficiency levels below for the first time maintained credit quality at comfortable levels in chile our digitalization process allow us to increase significantly our customer attraction which is reflected in the plus increase in demand deposits and doubledigit fee income growth widening the gap in npls with our competitors being the market leader excellent yearonyear profit performance nii plus improved efficiency increasing gap to peers lower cost of credit driven by better than expected performance in smes and corporates the digital consumer bank balance sheet dynamics were solid new business activity has recovered to the pre covid levels up despite the challenges posed by covid restrictions and the semiconductor shortage of note was auto plus originations on the back of increase in our market share by basis points across europe additionally were working on the expansion of openbank which performed very well in the year in terms of customer increase and volumes loans grew customer funds total digital consumer bank revenue was boosted by the new business recovery particularly fee income and leasing positive year in credit quality with further reduction in cost of credit in summary excellent results reflecting underlying profit growth and increasing profitability return on tangible equity exceeding going to the two businesses that we report as secondary segments both have had in the industry a very good year the corporate investment banking revenues grew sharp improvement in loan loss provision we are gaining share and we are on top of the market in project finance top in project finance in europe and latam and as ana mentioned focused on the sustainable alternatives and esg through the green financing we banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 are investing in the

corporates double in size since march in summary we have significant progress in the last months as pagonxt as we invest in worldclass technology and recreate the best payments indiscernible to continue to innovating and launching new products and i hand over the floor to ana to continue with the presentation ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea group executive chairman banco santander sa thank you very much josé antonio so as i said were delivering today and were building the santander of tomorrow we believe in an era of digital revolution this is absolutely essential and i have to say first of all im hugely proud of our team and the progress we have made over the last few years we have laid the foundations to deliver great value and service to our growing customer base which as i said was up million since we have at the same time increased profits we have improved our profitability and we have strengthened our capital base as well as delivering sustainable returns to shareholders i am incredibly excited about what lies ahead we are continuing our journey to become the best open financial services platform acting responsibly and earning the lasting loyalty of our people customers shareholders and communities and this is what is driving our day to day across regions and businesses in our daily work actually were not just of course meeting our legal and regulatory expectations our aspiration is to exceed all our stakeholders and our peoples expectations this is a key driver to attract the best talent which as we know is at the basis of success for any company these days so we are focusing on the areas where as a group we can have the greatest impact helping more people and businesses prosper in a way that is simple personal and fair i mentioned earlier our unique business model delivering more predictable and growing results through the cycle and this is the case not just over the last few years but over the last years we have a diversified geographical footprint which is wellbalanced between emerging and developed markets i would like to note especially the contribution of the us to the groups underlying profit increase from in to this year we are building on a global scale and this is really whats allowing us to grow revenues but also to expand our business one great example you have here is getnet getnet is a global platform now operating in six countries and our global businesses insurance and corporate banking continue to add value with very strong revenue banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 growth compared to up for cib and in wealth management insurance these are areas where were intending to invest more as they have very high profitability and strong growth importantly and this is a key goal for us across the bank is customer satisfaction we want customers that love our products our nps is already at the top in most of our markets and we intend to continue building on that improving customer service but also increasing connectivity this is one of the i would say more difficult but more successful goals we have set for ourselves over the last few years we are continuing to invest in technology to change our business model increasing the connectivity not just sharing but building across the group together creating a better bank where do we see the return on these investments i think these are two key facts you have on the screen over the last two years this is compared to our digital transactions of our core banks have gone from in to in our digital sales again across the group over total sales from to and again i want to stress in many cases now building global solutions together i will comment a bit more later but pagonxt aims to me a common tech backbone on payments for all our customers across the group as well as for open market one santander we are redefining our own operating model and i want to give a couple of examples our regional consumer finance platform in south america a single platform for all of the countries in south america in europe our common app but also other initiatives to develop key products and drive connectivity where we have horizontal business owners already in place leading for europe and in north america where for example technology is already being shared across the us and mexico weve saved million over the last couple of years just for were aiming for an additional million in this region last but not least digital consumer bank where we are replatforming our legacy auto and consumer on top of our retail banking native digital openbank i want to stress in this vertical were going digital building our own technology at the same time were maintaining a return i want to now briefly share with you how were managing our capital allocation and how were increasing every year the discipline we today have the tools to manage in a very granular way our capital you can see here in that we had of our rwas below the cost of equity were aiming to have in of course these are businesses where were investing for the future and i want to say that in that was so weve been ruthless in this and the discipline we intend to continue to manage in this way going forward we will allocate more capital as we have done over the last few years through our most profitable and higher growing geographies segments and businesses were expecting rwas to expand at lower rates than loans again in we again have a target for our front book to not have assets going on the books on average across the bank below in compared to and well continue to actively manage our underperforming portfolios as i mentioned we are also making some accretive investments of course the offers to buy minorities weve done we did brazil at the end of weve done mexico and santander consumer as josé antonio mentioned was actually closed this monday two days away two days ago banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 and we also made still pending closing the acquisition of amherst pierpont thats pending regulatory approval but this is incredibly accretive to us and the connectivity with our franchises cib franchises across europe and americas is really important in every case we in these acquisitions we are audio gap keeping fully loaded at so we can continue to grow in the future increase shareholder returns going forward so as a summary strong focus on capital discipline will be key we have done it in we aim to deliver tangible net asset value per share growth growing cash dividend as profitability improves and making share buybacks a meaningful part of our remuneration strategy we continue to target a payout ratio even though in the future we would aim to increase that to again subject to a board and to the performance of the bank longerterm this is the intention and very importantly we aim to keep our cet1 at the level as i mentioned so how are we going to deliver on these goals we want to continue to deliver on our business model we are working on the increased connectivity our three strategic initiatives which i will mention briefly now one santander pagonxt and the digital consumer bank all of which are providing a distinctive competitive advantage because were building a globally recognizable brand that customers trust and value at the same time improving profitability so first with one santander this is the way we are building first regionally but also from today across the global footprint shared services i mentioned the latin american consumer finance but many others are european operating hubs and were aiming first and foremost to improve customer experience but to do that in an efficient way and in a profitable way so these are the targets for europe again structural change while delivering sustainable profitability this covers the four countries spain uk portugal and poland we are very very confident that this turnaround which youve seen already some of those numbers this year for individuals the focus will be enhancing digital but always building on that personal and digital combination we are working through pagonxt on delivering for smes a differential services crossborder we announced also the billion cost synergies by the end of we are remaining committed to that obviously its going to be a bit more challenging given the inflation environment were expecting for some tailwinds so normalizing cost of risk by and in addition well continue to reallocate capital among not just segments and countries but also into more profitable and higher growth businesses in north america we expect to develop and work further on the synergies on the back of that crossborder us mexico but also across the group opportunities operational efficiencies will be meaningful we are now working actually we already have the plans in place we got the approval yesterday to manage the business in a different way i will comment on that in a few minutes we launched a few years ago the usmexico business corridor were generating very high growth in crossborder customers just as an example total revenue had a increase yearonyear on this business and were aiming to continue that growth the aim for the region would be around rote and an efficiency of in the us and i want to focus on the consumer side the goal is to simplify the bank and really build a consumer auto business leveraging on what we have done in europe and also in latin america but also on the very strong santander consumer franchise and the core deposits in our retail bank amherst pierpont again is going to allow us to deliver for many more customers banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 the connectivity is already great around for example in our wealth management customers in the us have been referred by our bankers in other geographies and this is a business where we can actually grow much faster and in mexico again accelerating growth improving profitability where we have been investing in technology together with the us for the last couple of years just a bit more detail on the us and how we are looking at the business i want to just remind everyone that for a few years were very much focused on and of course that will continue to be a focus but now we can focus on growth and on the management of the business which is aligned to the us peers so the consumer business will be focused on a consumer model much like the digital consumer bank is in europe well be leveraging on two very key group assets one is technology and the second one is our oem and experience across and relationships across the world this year we delivered return on equity actually a bit above that for next year the goal is with efficiency around this simplification is going to be key were actually exiting some businesses in the us like the home equity and mortgages to really simplify the bank on what it is we believe we need to support our retail customers and the consumer business in terms of the cre and multifamily were top in the us very profitable through the cycle funded by commercial deposits cib i mentioned already we see a lot of upside in lowrisk customer base businesses where amherst pierpont adds a significant investor institutional customer base and the leading brand we have in all of latin america in high net worth again theres many opportunities here for addon businesses where were investing and we believe this is going to be one of our drivers of growth we will by the way we are working sometime in  to have a more detailed meeting with investors on our strategy in the us giving you more detail on how it is that were going to execute in this key market for us south america again strong growth in customers and revenues we remain absolutely confident that the region is a highgrowth opportunity delivering through the cycle one key aspect is the growth of the middle class in many of these markets that is the key to the expanding demand for our services we are expecting doubledigit growth in retail we will consolidate more and more operations across the region in many of the verticals we believe theres a lot of value operating as a single bank with its regional approach and building of the connectivity that i described in corporates just to give you an example were growing by around with the multilatinas thats a million business today and of course with very strong opportunities also with amherst pierpont in terms of access in dollar markets in wealth the connection with our bank in miami is a key differentiator for us and in global businesses and here i mean cards and payments again building on the global platforms and all of that leading to a regional return on tangible equity of around and that is in spite of the cyclical currency depreciation with the current efficiency of around so let me briefly turn to pagonxt this is a very strategic initiative payments are at the heart of our customers banking relationships its key for our loyalty strategy thats not new it has happened for many years now its turning digital and scale becomes crucial so again this is a highgrowth highprofitability business and i want to say that as we build this platform were also delivering revenue growth were very pleased with the progress that pagonxt has made this year were investing to integrate all these payment systems to benefit the scale across the santander banks but especially customers but also open market as you can see there in the slide we have set ambitious targets for we grew close to our revenues this year were aiming for another growth in revenues next year banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 you can see there our payments hub again this is what uniting all our banks with a common tech backbone in payments were aiming to reach million customers this year and to be managing the payments the legacy payments will be managed for all our banks eventually here but about a third of the total payments volume already in and more than billion by the way these are trillions of transactions if you measure that in billions were going to continue to accelerate the growth here were working on integrating the merchant acquiring business including with wirecard and a common platform we have a very strong ecommerce proposition again we are aiming to increase our active merchants to million our payments volume to billion and very importantly to generate in open market in acquiring the international trade again were aiming to grow this in a significant way this is the way were going to bring together our smes the smes that trade these are the highergrowth higherprofitability usually customers and we are also as you know with ebury were very happy with the progress and with a revenue growth aimed for our third strategic pillar i mentioned several times already the digital consumer bank its operating in european countries its being replatformed as we maintain profitability into the openbank tech stack and i want to say that has been a very important year we have set important targets for as you can see in the slide openbank is the worlds largest fullservice global digital bank operating in five countries including in argentina now we launched yesterday for were expecting to serve close to million customers but with very strong doubledigit growth in certain products like roboadvisor and customer assets were serving more than roughly this year and aiming for offline and ecommerce merchants with very high growth on customer loans especially through the buy now pay later which were aiming to launch in spain in in the auto business again where we have not just in europe but in north america and south america were probably the global leader in this business were planning to serve million customers with new origination in leasing and auto growing more than and and digital sales also doing incredibly well and growing double digit for our rote expectation and guidance is with efficiency at and driven by double digit customer growth so i just want to end by saying again that as i started we have delivered every single year in many cases above our guidance but very importantly and in spite of covid were today ahead of where we were in in many aspects on capital we set a target of to were at on a fully loaded basis on rote we set to were very close to and aim to be above for were guiding to continue revenue growth in the midsingledigit billion efficiencies and that is double what we said in if you remember we said billion efficiencies we added another billion last year which will be completed in and a costincome for next year so very importantly for shareholders shareholder returns of underlying profit with again this is a first for santander we believe investing in our own shares is an excellent choice and this will be a permanent feature of our shareholder remuneration all of that was we were advancing our green finance objectives im not going to go through these obviously we can give you more detail but we are really trying to lead the sector on this weve provided specific targets for our energy portfolio for coal specifically were very ambitious in our financial empowerment we believe an inclusive society is crucial and we can really be a leader on this also and of course embedding esg in general in audio gap banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 question and answer section q strain even including potential ma in mexico and some other places thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa so let me take the second one and maybe josé antonio can take the second the first one on brazil so we are very satisfied and we have a great business in mexico we do not need to buy were generating great profits we believe thats going to accelerate were gaining market share i actually commented this morning that weve built from scratch an auto finance business that in a couple of years is market share so let me be very clear we do not need to buy to generate very attractive and profitable growth having said that mexico is one of our core markets and so when the process is expected to begin and actually its months away we expect to be part of that process i can assure you were generating a lot of capital we want to generate more capital and that is one of the goals of all the management team ensuring that we are putting business on the books that is profitable and reducing the investing in new businesses as i said from to of our total rwas so we would do that in a way that is attractive for our shareholders thats really all i can say if it ends up happening if you look back the last couple of years in some cases we actually went ahead and did a transaction in others and brazil was a good example we did not do the deal that was obviously an inmarket comarket opportunity so that is really all i can say at this point on the asset quality on brazil josé antonio would you take that please josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa yeah sure as youve seen in the results presentation that we were growing in brazil i should say that these two different splits in the loan book in brazil one split on the i am referring to in the consumer side where were growing around particularly grew faster in the first part of the year than the second half where we tightened a bit our grade standards and we grew less in the second part of the year going forward that is on top of these we were building a significant amount of provisions for the expected loss taking into account the macro outlook that as you mentioned in your question we expect the gdp probably to grow in and we are adjusting to the situation and we already feel that we provide for this scenario already in our growth is going to be what were seeing right now is relatively low demand on the corporate sector and our growth now in the consumer side is going to be at best at the in line with inflation at best we should say inflation is running now at its expected to run at the end of the year in the probably you should expect a highsingle digit but in line with inflation or below inflation and probably were going to grow less than the market so these make us comfortable that taking into account our provisioning levels our origination standards were going to be able to managing the slowdown banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 so remember that we face a more difficult situation in and when the market was extremely negative and although we are not in a position to reduce the cost of risk as we did in and we think that wed be in a position to probably not to change significantly the cost of risk from what youve seen in the last couple of quarters ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa yeah i may just add one fact which i think is crucial for all of you and the reason that were doing so well in brazil of course we have a great team and theres great execution but please do not forget that for south america and brazil is of our loans and of our profits and the reason for that is we have a lot of fees and a lot of diversified different income streams that are growing really well this is crucial aside from the actual credit management that josé antonio was explaining josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa i forgot to mention that the lending to consumers now is secure yeah in the past it was below now its secure that means that is payrollbased lending and mortgage yeah so these make us more comfortable visàvis with the scenario you mentioned begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from francisco riquel from alantra you are now live francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes good morning thank you for taking my questions and first one i wanted to ask about your cost to income target for if you can please comment on what should drive the improvement in the ratio at the group level in particular how did you see cost inflation in emerging markets and brazil in particular if you think that cost to income could improve in these markets or not and also in developed markets you admit that the billion cost cutting target is challenging demanding a high level of investments in technology so i wonder if you can give more guidance in terms of costs for the business units uk in particularly the restructuring seems a bit slow second question on capital you can update on the headwinds expected for in terms of restructuring charges given and then also the regulatory headwinds that we might expect and also relative with capital a followup on the previous questions i wonder what is the minimum cet1 that you would be comfortable in leveraging up if you were to embark on ma for example the banamex deal i see that you are guiding for both in and in the mediumterm which is an increase versus the previous range so i wonder if this is also your new threshold in terms of capital also in the event of ma thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa thank you very much so let me just give you a highlevel view on capital again so as i said has been a pivotal year for santander from a capital perspective we gave a range of to back in i want to stress that from a regulatory perspective from a supervisory perspective from an economic and prudence banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 perspective the to and the gives us ample buffers against our minimums this is really important we finish at actually fully loaded at if we take account of the inorganic and i really want to stress that the is because we understand investors want the so we are going to be at for throughout the year this allows us as i said to be very strong from a balance sheet perspective it allows us to grow profitably and also to reward our shareholders increasing as our profits increase so again the buffer is just to give you a number bps of our minimums but also because we have proved and i gave these numbers not all banks require the same amount of capital business models are different and more or less volatile we have proven to be the most resilient bank in the latest eba stress test with i think its ph a bit more capital depletion in the adverse thats ph on average for the banks but very importantly our geographic diversification retail commercial business youve seen that in the crisis youve seen that in a global pandemia year after year this is not just the last the last years we have the lowest eps volatility another evidence of course is the fixed income investors which look at our balance sheet inside and out we have i think the first or second probably the second lowest credit cost than any of our peers so again this is crucial having said that as i said we are going to be at and is our target for and very importantly and youre seeing that year after year were generating more and more capital organically increasing our profitability and thats still the intention i just said for the mediumterm and well give you detail how well get there well be at or actually maybe even above of that so this is really really important josé antonio i think i answered that at least on the higher level which i think is something which we care about again were listening to you were listening to investors and its been a pivotal year and our aim is that this is not the issue that we need to discuss we want to focus more on growth and opportunities ahead on the costincome i think we were reluctant to give many more details but obviously we want to give more i want to stress that we have said that we are committed to the billion im just saying that its going to be harder to do because of inflation but were good at this and hopefully our track record josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa we gave you guidance your question as i understood you well is more related with emerging markets where we are facing very high inflation both in brazil and mexico nothing to say about argentina ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa argentina indiscernible josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa argentina and less so in chile what we think given the efficiency levels that we got in this country is we do not expect we already elaborate on brazil outlook we do expect not to grow costs on top of revenues probably banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 theres not that much room to go lowering the costincome in brazil were already below so were going to probably stay at these levels in chile where we are slightly below continues to be a reference to me in argentina we have room to improve clearly we are still above and mediumterm target and we should make significant progress towards this to go to the that we deem is the right costincome ratio for an emerging market like argentina so this is our view but the main gains again should come from europe yeah so cost in europe we have a target we feel comfortable with our target in europe and were going to continue to show some gains in costs and costs in europe in should go down in nominal terms now i already mentioned ana is telling me that i mentioned well is in we expect a significant still in spain costs going down in nominal terms portugal probably more so probably in the region of doubledigit minus and uk probably in the region of close to midsingledigits so down in europe so this is the big deal on costs in as ana mentioned before we are on track to meet our target and our target requires us to be in negative territory taking into account inflation in poland we may be around flat inflation in poland is pretty high salary increases in poland are running in the region of and taking into account all of these we expect to be in line with flat costs in poland so thats the work we are doing in changing our operating model in europe thats what one europe means taking advantage of our scale in the four quarters to increase the productivity on the back of a better operational model begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from britta schmidt from autonomous research you are now live britta schmidt q analyst bernstein autonomous llp yeah good morning ive got three questions please just to confirm on the cet1 ratio if we included a buyback element for  and the pending deals would it be right to say well be at can you just confirm that the regulatory headwinds are still expected at around basis points the second question is on spain despite a decrease in the customer spread nii was up can you give a bit more color on that and maybe also on the reduction in insurance fees and the third one is on the used operating model youve commented on some regulatory approvals could you tell us a bit more about that please thanks ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa regulatory approvals yeah regulatory approvals in the us we got approval for santander consumer buybacks and we executed that on monday we are pending approval for the amherst pierpont which is the other transaction thats the only one pending banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 on the cet1 including everything we know until now would be very close to i think its so including all the we were at exactly at the close of december well be very close to something like that its in the including the pending approvals which will happen in  in terms of regular so again weve said we will be at as i explained we have the diversified very predictable business model weve delivered every single year and there will be some ups and downs every quarter but our goal is to be at the end of the year at or above and id say every quarter also regulatory headwinds i think maybe josé antonio you can take that one and the spain insurance regulatory headwinds i think have we said anything about that do you want to expand again were going to be at we feel very confident on and they should be leveling off and of course a lot less than in thats for sure josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa on the capital naturally there is some potential as always regulatory headwinds coming basically from some come from models difficult assess at this stage and but we feel that aside from any kind of inorganic that we dont have deals feels that we dont now contemplate at this stage were going to be running around maybe a bit higher a bit longer than that yeah including the regulatory headwinds and probably taking into account the outlook for interest rate some impacts coming from the alco portfolio yeah so everything based on our expectations right now so this is in cet1 insurance well we have insurance businesses its running its going very well all across the board including spain spain is growing a lot what we have had in spain is some oneoff coming from annuities that while probably it is not going this is not going to for sure its not going to repeat it in but i will be surprised if our fee insurance generation in spain does not growth in the region of in so im fairly optimistic about insurance and i think insurance continues to be one of our best opportunities to grow our fee income finally the third question you want to take it the operating model in the us ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa sure so we will give more detail at some point in  we are planning to do a special on the us but the operating model in the us has four business lines as you can see in one of the slides one is a consumer vertical were not aiming to compete as a full service bank but rather follow more the digital consumer model in europe ie consumer where we have the 10th largest consumer auto lender in the us we are going to manage that as a consumer vertical where were going to fund with core retail deposits this is essential to grow our business in consumer into the prime and nearprime because of cost of funding in parallel were going to streamline our retail operation we are planning to exit certain businesses that are not scalable where were not competitive and focus on where we are competitive were working on a new tech stack that we believe would allow us to achieve significant synergies and thats not just from the management of the business with the consumer which by the way were not able to do because it was a listed company and so youre going to see very much a bank that mirrors us banks where you have the consumer funded by core deposits where you have a commercial operation that is based on the connectivity with our market i explained in mexico and others and finally the wealth management and cib that i referred to in my presentation so thats really the operating model we are working on banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley you are now live alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions the first one is kind of on the payout i mean youve reached your which youve described at length which is where you want to be profits outlook is significantly better than what consensus is saying is according to your guidance youre expecting only sort of low singledigit rwa growth why not payout rate in is it because can we expect some reassessment or a topup of the buybacks maybe later in the year or is there some restructuring charges that we dont know about that might happen or are you leaving some room for addon ma or just what it feels like your capital accumulation should be very strong this year and it feels like theres a disconnect there and second on the us strategy i realized youre going to give more color presumably in  with the special but have you had any more interactions with chrysler realized they bought the inhouse financing arm and your joint venture comes to an end in may next year do you have any more color maybe what part of the revenues do you think you can keep them and what would be at risk i mean in the past i think josé antonio has explained that the subprime part is probably something you can keep i dont know if you can quantify that for us and how youre going to be able to offset that was the idea thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa very much excellent question so on the payout as weve said we intend to increase and we are aiming for increased profitability which means that if that happens and we are confident it will we would be increasing dividend per share and buybacks at the moment the intention is a for next year i also said that we aspire to increase total shareholder return beyond the with around of remuneration through share buybacks and that is really all we can say at this point again we have profitable growth opportunities we think its interesting for you the investors that we do that in an era of increased competition were being very disciplined about where we put our investments we are getting returns i mentioned revenue growth for pagonxt again next year and i can tell you also its going to be ebitda positive actually next year so that is the goal the other very important change i want to stress this is the current management is absolutely bent and the board is absolutely supportive and we all believe its an excellent opportunity to buy back our shares we are not going to issue new shares at this price were buying back shares i want to leave that very clear that that is something we will not do it was an exception last year because of our retail investors and ecb guidelines we want to buy back as many shares as we can within the guidance weve given you in terms of the us chrysler has indicated that we will continue to be their preferred provider weve arrived on a very attractive agreement in europe with stellantis as their auto partner this is a great business its a great banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 business in europe in the us and in latin america and we have a great relationship which is working for both sides begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from sofie peterzens from jpmorgan you are now live sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi here is sofie from jpmorgan so just a followup question on the previous comments so you mentioned that you are not going to do any more kind of youre not going to issue any new shares does this also relate to any potential bid for banamex in mexico so if you could just elaborate on this point and then also another followup question so could you just confirm that the regulatory headwind the capital headwind in will be around basis points and then my final question would be in the us we saw basis points of loan loss based in in the past i remember you talking more about basis points was a normalized level could you just comment how we should think about the loan losses in the us going forward and what you saw through the cycle normalized level of cost of risk in the us thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa so i want to be very clear we are not contemplating in any case to issue new shares for banamex or whatever we are buying back shares we believe its an excellent opportunity it would make no sense for us to be buying back shares and then to issue new shares were not planning were not contemplating issuing new shares for any acquisition at this point at the share price we believe again its an excellent investment opportunity youve seen myself buying every time i can i mean ive bought many many shares its a public number so that is very clear were not contemplating issuing shares in terms of the regulatory i believe josé antonio mentioned that less than basis points its not its less than basis points in terms of the us and maybe you can comment on the cost of risk but whats important in the us and of course we are delivering and this year we are using as the adjusted rote across our markets because us and mexico for example were expecting very large dividends this year and some next year actually the us would be managed around not and the returns on the us including the cost of risk and everything else we are aiming medium term through the cycle which is a very attractive return to our shareholders on the cost of risk josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa yeah i should say our business in youre referring to scusa the cost of risk in as youve seen in the presentation was unusually low we expect some normalization going forward not coming back to the same levels in and even looking in the coming years our business were going to continue to be a preferred banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 partner for chrysler for the next couple of years this is our expectation and we are originating more on the prime space than in the subprime space naturally the cost of risk the second number will depends on the mix because on one side across the cycle we have the subprime space where the cost of risk is in mid to highsingle digit and in the prime space is less than so naturally this is what is going to drive this on the long run this will be maintained across the cycle not in where we expect the cost of risk to be still significantly lower than the number you mentioned the that we have had in the previous year so its not going to be the case in and going forward the mix is what matters probably were going to have more prime and less subprime because we are as ana mentioned in the presentation we are booking in the bank more prime loans begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from benjamin toms from rbc you are now live benjamin toms q analyst rbc europe ltd good morning thank you for taking my questions two on the uk please firstly in terms of customer spread we saw that fall slightly in the uk quarteronquarter in relation to your sensitivity guidance for basis points rate rise in the geography can you just clarify what youve assumed or talk a bit more about assumptions for customer spread changes deposit betas and margin erosion from competition and then secondly we saw some data released recently in the uk which showed that buyer mortgage demand was very strong over the christmas holidays can you just clarify what youre assuming for loan growth or mortgage growth in the uk for this year thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa josé antonio maybe you take those josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa yeah so in uk these two you mentioned the rate rise we are taking in our assumption some rise in rates not as big probably and our assumption is to go from the current basis points to basis points maybe a bit higher this has two effects as you rightly said we expect to make some margin expansion on the liability side on the asset side that means mortgages depends on the competition you know the competition drives prices in the uk its a market that is fairly competitive and as you mentioned in the second part of your questioning during christmas we have strong demand in mortgages and we were keeping our market share we grew along with the market we expect to grow along the year the mortgage book very much in line with the market not losing now gaining market share and the big question mark is competitive pressure in the market we saw a good year the first half of the year more competition in the second half now its fairly stable yeah so thats the situation on the market and banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 this is what i can comment to you at this point natural rate rises plays in favor of us so sensitive to the balance sheet is towards higher rates begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from ignacio ulargui from bnp paribas exane you are now live ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas thanks very much and thanks for the presentation and taking my questions i have two questions one is on esg commitments i mean you have given guidance on what is the support that youre planning in terms of lending in green finance targets i was wondering whether at any stage the bank is considering to disclose the scope emissions for the loan book just trying to track a bit more on progressing towards that net zero by and the other question is a bit more linked to the previous one at a bank level if you could just run through a bit of whats your interest rate sensitivity on the main units of the bank thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa thank you so let me take both of those i mean the interest rate sensitivity actually we are positioned for higher rate so net it should be positive sometimes that takes some time to feed through but clearly positive on the esg commitments scope so we are taking into account scope as we go through the stress test we did some of that already last year were doing that this year were actually going to be very focused on embedding that bottom up but obviously to measure scope we need consistent numbers we need our customers to give you numbers that we can rely on and we then need to compare that with others in a way thats comparable and all of that is going to take some time so its really important and we are working with regulators and supervisors that we take these stress tests where we are going to measure the scope as a learning exercise so we can have common measurement that we can compare much as you do with financial numbers we are very involved im personally very involved in the working group so we can ensure that that happens in a fair way again the countries were not in africa but of course were in latin america that are now beginning to develop and to ensure that we can measure those what is green and what is acceptable we need some common grounds but yes we are measuring that and we will disclose as soon as we believe we can do that in a way that is comparable across others as soon as possible begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from marta sanchez romero from bank of america you are now live marta sanchez romero q analyst bank of america merrill lynch banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 good morning thank you very much my first question is going back to banamex given that the relative discount of santander group shares would you consider raising equity using your list of companies in mexico or minorities are done and related to this have you run preliminary numbers on potential cost synergies in mexico where you could buy banamex and my last question is if you can comment on a general outlook on asset quality in spain and also more specifically what are your plans for your real estate subsidiaries merlin metrovacesa and the jv with blackstone theres been lots of headlines recently in the papers are there any risk of further impairments in this stake thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa so let me take those i think whats really important is we are not contemplating in any way issuing group shares we want to buy back our group shares its really too early to say we are very happy with our organic growth as i said before when the process begin we do expect to be part of the process but we are not going to in any way contemplate at these prices group share issuance in terms of banamex numbers for years we follow our competitors we know our competitors numbers so we do have an understanding we are not working on that specifically at the moment its really too early in terms of asset quality let me just comment on the group and say that normalization through the cycle cost of credit we expect to happen in so would still be below the cycle and again josé antonio gave some detail already i believe on brazil which could be one of the areas where there could be some questions in terms of our real estate subsidiaries these are not permanent holdings in any way were trying to make sure we maximize value in terms of when we have to restructure some assets the goal there is to stay as long as it makes sense at some point obviously this is not a core business but for the moment we dont have any specific plans there to actually do anything we believe we can generate value for now begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from daragh quinn from kbw you are now live daragh quinn q analyst kbw hi good morning thank you for the presentation and taking the questions just a first one on banamex if you could give us an idea of how you understand the timeline for that process this year and then a second question just on the uk and nii declining in the quarter and maybe just remind us of how you see the uk nii reacting to higher rates and the impact that the current expectations for higher rates could have on loan growth if any and then just a final small question just on the dividend i mean traditionally youve always announced the dividend proposal with the results and i think you said youd be announcing the dividend in a few weeks time just curious on that kind of changing in timeline and if you could be more specific on the timing for the announcement of the final dividend thank you very much banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa so again on banamex i think the crucial thing for investors and i am also a significant shareholder at least at my level were not going to issue shares and the process we have no idea but we believe its going to be long we dont think its going to be for a few months because theres a carveout involved they have announced that they need to put in place a new subsidiary where they would be actually putting the assets they want to keep so we dont think thats going to happen for months probably more  but again we are not in we do not know we have not engaged at this point in terms of net interest income in the uk i think josé antonio explained that in sufficient detail in terms of higher rates in the uk would have a positive impact a significant positive impact in the uk that was a previous question it would be hundreds of millions of a positive impact for basis points parallel rise in the curve in terms of the dividend there is no mystery i mean we have said what its going to be effectively without saying the reason is that buybacks require a different process from cash and so that is one of the reasons but mainly its because we like to keep some announcement for our shareholders meeting so im a bit surprised at the questions on this we have said its going to be of underlying income cash  so again i would not like to give the number but its a pretty simple mathematical calculation so in a few weeks well be saying that again we have a shareholders meeting coming up and well be calling the shareholders meeting at the end of february thats when we will be giving that begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from mario ropero ph gracha from bestinver securities you are now live mario ropero q analyst bestinver securities hi good morning my first question is on ph revenues in spain nii outlook for is probably hard so i just wanted to ask if you think that fee growth will be enough to offset this and perhaps linked to this to give some fee guidance in spain in and then the second one is on pagonxt well basically an update on when you expect breakeven to be reached thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa pagonxt ebitda positive next year growth in revenues well be giving more detail on that in april were planning to give a restatement and showing you the horizontals in more detail its a business thats growing revenues ebitda positive in on spain josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 well the question of nii in spain i should say volumes will be relatively flat probably will grow a bit both in loans and revenue and deposits the main driver is going to be tltro yeah so as the tltro spikes as its the negative will come basically from the tltro impact in the nii in spain yeah begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from andrea filtri from mediobanca you are now live andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom thank you first question on capital can you tell us the expected impact from the eba regulatory changes on treatment of minorities please and just a clarification im following from brittas question before the cet1 ratio fully loaded that you have given pro forma for all inorganic operations is not including the second tranche of the buyback against profits including it it would be if im correct second question on ma if youre not issuing shares is the cet1 target youre giving a firm target even in case of a banamex at the acquisition and finally you announced youre exiting some businesses in the us if you could detail for us the profits and riskweighted assets attached to this thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa so the eba minimum josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa well its not ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa its not josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa yet a regulation its supposed to come but its not yet a regulation in any case as it is what we know as of today maybe in the region of couple of basis points maybe basis points maybe basis points maybe basis points in this region so its what we know today okay because its not still translated into as far as i know into a regulation ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa right on capital again the pro forma included both acquisitions one has closed the other one hasnt i reiterate that for for every quarter as i said before the target is to be at for including every quarter in including  including buybacks and cash and of course that gets accrued when you actually do it and the accrual will happen in  most likely banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 in terms of the us well give more details on when we do a special day on the us were planning to do that in new york well announce that briefly in a few weeks probably so we can give you all the details on that and again the is a target for this year and were not planning to issue new shares in the event that we do something inorganic begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from benjie creelansandford from jefferies you are now live benjie creelansandford q analyst jefferies international ltd yes good morning everyone i had a question on the digital consumer bank just looking at the rote and the costtoincome guidance for its sort of implied that you expect the cost of risk there to remain still relatively low this year i just wondered if you could perhaps discuss the trajectory of the cost of risk in the digital consumer business and what you would see as the normalized level and also on the digital consumer bank we talked before about some of the synergies potentially available between the traditional consumer business and the digital bank im just wondering whether you could confirm whether youre currently able to use deposits raised in the digital bank to fund business out of the consumer bank in europe and or whether that is seen as still a potential tailwind for the profitability of that business going forward thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa so yes we are running those businesses together and so that deposit funding which is now at billion is able to fund the consumer were aiming to grow that in a significant way weve grown customers actually through openbank in germany holland portugal outside of spain around in those markets and germany included and we believe we can do much more of that again one of the goals is that by managing these customers in a native cloud cloudbased platform its going to be easier to launch in new markets but very importantly what weve learned in spain with openbank is we are very effective at crossselling and actually achieving what i dont believe any other digital bank has achieved which is to have core deposits customers that use the bank as the primary bank and therefore much lower cost of deposit than other native digital bank so thats the opportunity you havent seen that yet and we should expect to see that in cost of risk normalized cost of risk josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa in we are fairly ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa were already banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa were going to be already in line with so we do not see a significant risk there so the credit quality is very good ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa is still good yeah begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from fernando gil santanes sic fernando gil de santivanes you are now live fernando gil de santivanes q analyst barclays capital securities ltd hi good morning thank you for taking my questions just a quick followup question please on guidance first is on alco strategy is there any big change on the asco sic alco strategy that youre including in your guidance i feel that the polish book is still big this is one question one part the second is on provisions taken on that outlook rote above are you contemplating any release of the overlay provisions that you still have pending thank you very much ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa so on the alco strategy were not anticipating any change there as i said we are positioned for higher rates and basis points parallel shift will have the biggest benefits in the uk but even bigger in the eurozone again if you take both together over billion if you take europe the eurozone and the uk but again we dont have a josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa no we are just projecting ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa were not projecting josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa the we are projecting the portfolios we already banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa the ones that we already have josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa have in the balance sheet yeah ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa yeah josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa at the end of december ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa and provisions release for overlay i dont think we have anything on in right josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa well we still have some overlay in the balance sheet as you know and this well may be a deduction maybe offset potential credit losses depending but we are as i mentioned in relation with other questions very well provided to offset potential headwinds on the macro side well we are working on this based on being ifrs in expected losses and expected losses naturally depends very largely on gdp growth so we have different scenarios for different countries not very unique i would i should say in line with imf ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa right yeah we use imf and we use the curve and again going back to my point early on diversification there could be some positives but we believe the positives could be offset by the negatives and at the end of the day the model is going to continue working so there should be in principle no surprises even though you might get surprises in individual countries we believe the trends would offset each other begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we with the next question please technical difficulty begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa question please banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 operator our next question is coming from pamela zuluaga from credit suisse you are now live pamela zuluaga q analyst credit suisse hello good morning thank you for the presentation and for taking my questions i have two the first one is regarding the fxrelated mortgages in poland how should we think about your exposure to those weve seen other banks both actively reaching for outofcourt settlements and increasing their coverage levels amid unfavorable court decisions do you anticipate increasing charges related to the resolution of these mortgages and then my second question is basically a followup you had initially guided for an rote ranging from to now youre guiding for in is this level encompassing any downside risks from the higher than anticipated costs amid higher inflation like youre highlighting thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa first one and then and then josé antonio on the swiss francs so i believe its remarkable what the team has achieved we were achieving close to in after covid so in we guided mediumterm thats three four years so thats to to were going to were close to now were saying above next year second very important point again that shows we not just deliver but overdeliver when we gave the guidance we said to cet1 the goal there was were delivering close to after a pandemia with a lot more cet1 than what we guided in so that shows you the strength of our model the strength of our strategy and of our execution were now saying mediumterm we said but were still working on what would be our next three to fouryear plan which well present to you in so i just want to stress that were not just delivering were overdelivering in some aspects if you consider the extra capital that we have versus what we were planning for in and of course the pandemia audio gap josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa this is included in our nii guidance i mean our guidance for on the with expectation we have for rates so that is to go up in mexico brazil us uk not in europe but europe doesnt matter in this regard thats it the second question was q indiscernible josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa yeah well in if i am not wrong we cover the back the low side of the range established by bank of spain so very likely and this they have they already reduced on how the contributions by a small amount million million million no more but this show you the path going forward banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 q indiscernible josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa well the resolution fund the same may happen so these those are two things that cost us a yeah josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa million a year million so well this unless something happens this is the path going forward begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the last question please thank you operator our last question is coming from carlos cobo catena from société générale you are now live carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain hi thank you for the presentation ill try to be quick one is on organic capital formation you guided to so you explained the basis point formation this quarter but if i deduct the cash payout dividends and at1s i may get to something more around basis points so i was wondering what is the difference and whether that delta is recurrent going forward or not is that includes any sort of securitizations in the group and the second question is about stellantis in europe you renegotiated the agreement and i was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what are the expected changes in the business plan going forward or different business lines or how that new agreement could affect the business performance thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa so let me just take the second one on stellantis again we have a very strong relationship in europe weve already agreed a very very i think interesting agreement for both sides which would allow us to grow our business together over the next few years really thats baked into the numbers that you have again we are making a strong digital transformation as we deliver every year and we are committed to continue to do that and again stellantis is a very strong partner of us here and in the us in terms of the just as a general point id say that we are generating more and more capital organically in you had headwinds not just on regulation but also on markets especially exchange rates and interest rates to some degree i think josé antonio showed that in his presentation i dont know what you want to say about the future but banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2022 josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa well securitization naturally is a tool ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chairman banco santander sa yeah josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa with much capital the guide there is fairly simple as long as we can release capital doing securitization with the implicit cost of equity below the cost of equity were going to do that how much is going to be this this was very positive because in granular portfolios like the consumer finance ones we were able to release capital at the levels at that are very attractive and we continue to check the securitization market if offered opportunities were going to take it if they dont offer an opportunity we will keep more loans in our balance sheet its fairly simple our approach but naturally this is a source of flexibility given the very nature of our portfolio particularly the consumer finance ones ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea group executive chairman banco santander sa so i think thats it we tried to answer every question we very much appreciate your attention we know this has been a bit long but we wanted to give you not just the day to day but also a higher strategic vision of the confidence and the optimism actually we have about the business and reiterate again our commitment to continue profitable growth also increasing shareholder remuneration as we grow profits and were very again our model has once again shown it works and we are again very proud of our teams the huge work theyve done this year and are confident that they will continue to deliver for you all and for all our stakeholders in the years ahead again thank you very much and if anybody has any other questions our ir team is at your disposal have a great day thank you banco santander sa san corrected transcript
