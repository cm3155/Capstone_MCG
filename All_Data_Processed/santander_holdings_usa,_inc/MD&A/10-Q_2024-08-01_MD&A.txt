subject to a floor plus four quarters of dividends the rule results in new firmspecific regulatory capital expectations which are equal to of cet1 plus the scb any gsib surcharge and any countercyclical capital buffer the gsib buffer is applicable only to the largest and most complex firms and does not apply to shusa in the event a firm falls below its new minimums the rule imposes

rule as of june shusas scb cet1 minimum requirement was shusas scb cet1 minimum requirement is expected to increase to as of october on july the federal banking agencies issued a capital proposal that would make significant changes to the regulatory capital rules applicable to large banking organizations including shusa and sbna and banking organizations with significant trading activity this proposal would implement the final elements of the basel iii capital framework and make other changes to the regulatory capital rules in response to recent bank failures the capital proposal would establish the expanded riskbased approach for calculating rwas that would apply to large banking organizations the expanded riskbased approach would include a new more risksensitive standardized approach for measuring credit risk and operational risk it would also include new standardized approaches for measuring market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk but would allow the use of internal models for market risk in certain circumstances with regulatory approval under the capital proposal a large banking organization would be required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the expanded riskbased approach and the current standardized approach and would use the lower of the two all capital buffer requirements including the scb requirement would apply regardless of whether the expanded riskbased approach or the existing standardized approach produces the lower ratio the total rwa calculation used in the expanded riskbased approach would be phased in over a threeyear period starting on july the requirement to reflect aoci in regulatory capital would also be phased in over a threeyear period starting on july all other elements of the calculation of regulatory capital would apply on the effective date of the final rule which is expected to be on or about july on october the federal banking agencies announced that they extended the comment period on the capital proposal from november until january in addition to pushing back the comment deadline the federal reserve indicated it would begin collecting data to gather more information from the

and results of operations liquidity rules the federal reserve the fdic and the occ have established a rule to implement the basel iii lcr for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies and a modified version of the lcr for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active the lcr is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30day time horizon smaller covered companies but with more than billion in assets such as the company are required to calculate the lcr monthly resolution planning the dfa requires the company to prepare and update resolution plans the 165d resolution plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the us bankruptcy code and that no extraordinary support is received from the us or any other government the most recent 165d resolution plan was submitted to the federal reserve and fdic in june in addition under amended fdia rules the idi resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of billion or more develop a plan for its resolution that supports depositors rapid access to their insured deposits maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in resolution on june the

full resolution plan every three years with interim supplements filed in the offyears longterm debt requirements on july the federal reserve and fdic issued an npr that would require banks with total assets of billion or more to maintain a layer of longterm debt from the holding company to improve financial stability by increasing the resolvability and resiliency of such institutions by requiring each such large bank to maintain a minimum amount of longterm debt to absorb losses the proposal would increase the options available to resolve such banks in case of failure additionally by reducing the risk that uninsured depositors would face losses longterm debt can reduce the speed and severity of bank runs and limit the risk of contagion when a bank is under stress the proposal would provide a threeyear phasein period and would also allow certain outstanding longterm debt to count toward the minimum requirements to provide banks with a reasonable period to transition to the required characteristics of eligible longterm debt instruments comments on the proposal were due on november shusa remains subject to the tlac requirements outlined below deposit insurance and assessments on

of the dif under the final rule the increase in rates began with the first quarterly assessment period of and will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds in order to support growth in the dif in progressing toward the fdics longterm goal of a reserve ratio the increase in assessment rates applies to sbna the recent failure of several large us banking institutions has led to increased market uncertainty under the fdia the loss to the dif arising from the use of the systemic risk exception must be recovered through one or more special assessments on idis depository institution holding companies or both as the fdic determines to be appropriate on may the fdic issued for public comment a proposed rule to impose a special assessment on idis to recover the loss to the dif resulting from the use of the systemic risk exception to protect the uninsured depositors of the failed us banking institutions the final rule was issued on november under the final rule the fdic would collect a special assessment from idis at a quarterly rate of approximately basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods starting with the first quarterly assessment period of in june of the fdic added an additional assessment to be collected at a quarterly rate of approximately basis points over an additional two quarters resulting in an additional accrual of

designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk nonprime loans will nonetheless experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers additionally higher unemployment rates higher gasoline prices unstable real estate values resets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates the general availability of consumer credit and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies defaults and repossessions as well as decreased consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products weaken collateral values and increase losses in the event of default because of the historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers the actual rates of delinquencies defaults repossessions and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn the companys automated originations process for these credits reflects a disciplined approach to credit risk management to mitigate the risks of nonprime customers the companys robust historical data on both organically originated and acquired loans provides it with the ability to perform advanced loss forecasting each applicant is automatically assigned a proprietary custom score using information such as fico scores dti ratios ltv ratios and over other

during the respective periods the company generally considers an account delinquent when an obligor fails to pay substantially all defined as of the scheduled payment by the due date overall total delinquencies decreased by million from december to june the main driver of this is the decrease in past due auto loans due to seasonal improvement in payment performance loan modifications loan modifications occur when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower in these cases the company agrees to make certain concessions to both meet the needs of customers and maximize its ultimate recovery on the loans the types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions limitations on accrued interest charged term extensions covenant waivers and deferments of principal modified loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status upon modification unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification for most portfolios modified loans may return to accrual status after a sustained period of repayment performance as long as the company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full ric modifications are placed on nonaccrual status when the company believes repayment under the revised terms is not reasonably assured and at the latest when the account becomes more than dpd ric modifications are considered for return to accrual when the account becomes days or less past due to the extent the modified loan is determined to be collateraldependent and the source of repayment depends on the operation of the collateral the loan may be returned to accrual status based on the foregoing parameters to the extent the modified loan is determined to be collateraldependent and the source of repayment depends on disposal of the collateral the loan may not be returned to accrual status the company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time based on this evaluation the company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio changes in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables chargedoff however the timing of a chargeoff may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a chargeoff to the extent deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is chargedoff historical chargeoff ratios and cash flow forecasts used in the determination of the adequacy of the alll for loans classified as modified are also impacted increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the alll and related credit loss expense changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of the alll and related credit loss expense item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and

ended june the company provided loan modifications to customers with an amortized cost basis at june of million and million respectively compared to million and million for the corresponding periods in loan modifications primarily consist of payment deferrals in the ric and auto loan portfolio the increase in payment deferrals in the ric and auto loan portfolio during the three months and six months ended june compared to the corresponding periods in was primarily driven by increased demand for payment deferrals higher loan balances and the use of payment deferrals in place of other loan modification programs credit risk the risk inherent in the companys loan and lease portfolios is driven by credit and collateral quality and is affected by borrowerspecific and economywide factors such as changes in unemployment gdp hpi cre price index used vehicle index and other factors in general there is an inverse relationship between credit quality of transactions and projections of impairment losses so that transactions with better credit quality require a lower expected loss the company manages this risk through its underwriting pricing and credit approval guidelines and

treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk including wholesale funding maturity targeting investment portfolio purchase strategies asset securitizationssales and financial derivatives interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates basis risk repricing risk yield curve risk and option risk basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes such as differences in the extent of changes in federal funds rates compared with the threemonth term sofr repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing such as onemonth versus threemonth reset dates as well as the related maturities yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products these four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations shocks to those simulations and scenario and market value analyses and the subsequent results are reviewed by management several assumptions and models are used to produce these analyses including assumptions about new business volumes loan and investment prepayment rates deposit flows interest rate curves economic conditions and competitor pricing certain models use historical data analyses to estimate future customer behavior such as deposit repricing and attrition estimates from these models can differ from actual behavior depending on various factors such as macroeconomic conditions competitor response etc item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net interest income simulation analysis the company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense to estimate the companys net interest income sensitivity this simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the companys net interest income sensitivity these various scenarios include parallel nonparallel gradual parallel and gradual nonparallel rate shocks applied relative to the implied marketbased forward curve as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four measures of risk described above the shocks below are extended using the parallel scenario and are applied instantaneously to the implied forward curve as of the stated monthend the basis point down shock has been added as market rates have increased this set of shocks represents a range of plausible rate shocks as an instantaneous shock basis points down can be analogous to a gradual rampdown of basis points over one year this information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the companys risk position remains within shusa board of directorsapproved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates the table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the companys net interest income based on interest rate changes at june and december the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to net interest income would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below june december down basis points down basis points up basis points up basis points mve analysis the company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing mve modeling this analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet mve is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities the mve calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size balance sheet mix yield curve relationships or product spreads which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes management examines the effect of interest rate changes on mve the sensitivity of mve to changes in interest rates is a measure of longerterm interest rate risk and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates the following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the companys mve at june and december the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to mve would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below june december down basis points down basis points up basis points up basis points as of june the companys profile reflected an increase of mve of for downward parallel interest rate shocks of basis points and a decrease of for upward parallel interest rate shocks of basis points the asymmetrical sensitivity between a basis point increase and a basis point decrease is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgagerelated products the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base largely nmds in downward parallel interest rate shocks mortgagerelated products prepayments increase their duration decreases and their market value appreciation is therefore limited at the same time with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels the company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its nmd customers for upward parallel interest rate shocks extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the companys mortgagerelated products which are predominantly longterm and fixedrate and for larger shocks the loss in market value is not offset by the change in nmds item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations limitations of interest rate risk analyses since the assumptions used are inherently uncertain the company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or mve actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume characteristics of new business behavior of existing positions and changes in market conditions and management strategies among other factors uses of derivatives to manage interest rate and other risks to mitigate interest rate risk and to a lesser extent foreign exchange equity and credit risks the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income the fair value of assets and liabilities and cash flows the company is subject to price risk through its capital markets and mortgage banking activities the company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios in addition shusas board of directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities the level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements and will vary from period to period management uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows these instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments the nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environments the company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold the majority of the companys residential msrs are accounted for at fair value as deemed appropriate the company economically hedges msrs using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase mbs for additional information on msrs see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements the company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities foreign exchange contracts which include spot and forward contracts represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreedupon price on an agreedupon settlement date exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate the company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales for additional information on foreign exchange contracts derivatives and hedging activities see note to the
