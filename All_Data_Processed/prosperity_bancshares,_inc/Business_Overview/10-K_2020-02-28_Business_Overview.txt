incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should provide incentives that do not encourage risktaking beyond the organizations ability to effectively identify and manage risks be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors these three principles are incorporated into the proposed revised rules on incentivebased payment arrangements at specified covered institutions released in may by a number of federal agencies including the federal reserve board fdic and sec the proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered institutions including the company and the bank that have at least billion in total assets which would include prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements and mandating appropriate recordkeeping under the proposed rule larger financial institutions with total consolidated assets of at least billion would also be subject to additional requirements the federal reserve board and fdic review as part of the regular riskfocused examination process the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations such as the company that are not large complex banking organizations these reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organizations activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements the findings of this supervisory initiative will be included in reports of examination deficiencies will be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect the organizations ability to make acquisitions and take other actions enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies cybersecurity in march federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity one statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internetbased services of the financial institution the other statement indicates that a financial institutions management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery resumption and maintenance of the institutions operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware a financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack financial institutions that fail to observe the regulatory guidance could be subject to various regulatory sanctions including financial penalties in january the occ and the fdic issued a joint statement on heightened cybersecurity risk to remind financial institutions of sound cybersecurity risk management principles the principles set forth in the joint statement elaborate on the standards described in the interagency guidelines establishing information security standards and in resources provided by the federal regulators such as the joint statement on destructive malware issued in march in february the sec published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents these sec guidelines and any other regulatory guidance are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations legislative and regulatory initiatives from time to time various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in congress and state legislatures as well as by regulatory agencies such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the company in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions the company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted and if enacted the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the company a change in statutes regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the company or the bank could have a material effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations effect on economic environment the policies of regulatory authorities including the monetary policy of the federal reserve board have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries among the means available to the federal reserve board to affect the money supply are open market operations in us government securities changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits these means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans investments and deposits and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits federal reserve board monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future the nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the business and earnings of the company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted table start
