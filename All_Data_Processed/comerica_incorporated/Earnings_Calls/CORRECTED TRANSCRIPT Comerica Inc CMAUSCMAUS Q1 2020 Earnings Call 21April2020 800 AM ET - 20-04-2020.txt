healthcare helping our customers and communities navigate this challenging environment by providing our expertise products and services is at the heart of comericas relationship banking strategy turning to slide and a summary of our first quarter results due to a large increase in our credit reserves we reported a loss of per share with the forecasted impact of the covid19 pandemic including the economic impact of social distancing and continued stress in the energy portfolio we prudently increased our credit reserves to over million or of total loans our reserves reflect our adoption of cecl which incorporates a life of loan methodology while theres a great deal of uncertainty about the duration and severity of the impacts related to covid19 we are closely monitoring our portfolio and proactively reaching out to customers we believe that our reserves are appropriate and we are currently well positioned average loans in our mortgage banker business which serves mortgage companies decreased with seasonally lower home purchase activity and a decline in refinance volumes for the quarter also national dealer continued to decline due to lower inventory levels however total periodend loans increased over billion to a record high as customers drew on their credit lines beginning in midmarch to meet cash needs and to build liquidity buffers also periodend mortgage banker increased at a record level as refi activity picked up as rates declined following strong seasonal deposit growth in the fourth quarter average deposit levels remained relatively stable after the typical decline in january deposits increased throughout the quarter relative to the first quarter last year average deposits were up billion or net interest income declined with the feds action to reduce interest rates concurrently we have taken action to appropriately adjust deposit pricing noninterest income declined with a decrease in noncustomerrelated activity including a reduction in deferred compensation returns which is offset in expenses as well as a gain on the sale of the business in the fourth quarter which was not repeated in addition following robust volume in the fourth quarter syndication activity slowed as economic uncertainty increased expenses decreased million as we maintained our discipline including a million decrease in salaries and benefits this resulted in an efficiency ratio below well below the peer average of in the fourth quarter capital remained strong we suspended our share repurchase program last month as we focused on deploying our capital to meet our customers growing financial requirements the tone of recent conversations ive had with customers across our markets reflects the challenges of the current environment it is important to note that in general over the past several years our customers have remained cautious prudently managing expenses and reducing leverage and anticipation of eventual economic downturn and while the environment has turned abruptly we all remain hopeful that covid19 will be contained soon and with the economic stimulus that has been provided globally business will return to normal quickly and now i will turn the call over to jim to review the quarter in more detail comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 james j herzog executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turn to slide average loans decreased approximately million in the first quarter as curt mentioned mortgage banker decreased following very strong refi activity in the fourth quarter and typical slow home sales in the first quarter this is the data reported by the mortgage bankers association also loans decreased in national dealer with lower inventory levels particularly in january and february energy declined on a decrease in capex and slightly better capital market activity early in the quarter these declines were partly offset by continued growth in commercial real estate driven by multifamily projects where we work with proven developers who provide substantial equity up front loan activity picked up significantly in the back half of march with the rapid change in economic conditions the increase in periodend loans to a record billion was due to a combination of customers drawing on lines to meet higher operating needs as well as building cash reserves in a time of uncertainty mortgage banker loans peaked at quarterend with rising refi volumes also as widely reported companies particularly larger customers drew down on lines to ensure they had excess cash as a buffer as a result our line utilization increased to nearly in and of itself we do not see this as a sign of credit issues mortgage banker general middle market and national dealer customers typically have a borrowing base andor financial covenants that govern the amount that can be drawn and therefore curtail risk further detail is provided on slide in the appendix since quarterend line usage has leveled out it is of the outmost importance that we support our customers important needs at this challenging time we are proactively reaching out to customers to determine their needs and provide our expertise we are granting amendments on addressing loan pricing as appropriate loan yields were a decrease of basis points from the fourth quarter this was a result of lower interest rates primarily onemonth libor slide provides details on deposits average balances were relatively stable included a million reduction in average noncustomer brokered deposits typically deposits decline in the first quarter in fact first quarter deposits in each of the last four years have declined billion or more this year has been different in line with my comments regarding line draws we believe customers are conserving cash and holding on to excess liquidity in this time of uncertainty interestbearing deposit cost decreased basis points as a result of a fullquarter benefit of actions taken in the fourth quarter as well as recent rate adjustments made in conjunction with the fed action in march total funding costs remained low at basis points primarily due to the large portion of noninterestbearing deposits as well as the floating rate nature of our wholesale funding as you can see on slide our mbs portfolio was stable and the yield on the portfolio held steady we opportunistically prepurchased a portion of second quarter expected payments that relatively attracted yields this resulted in the periodend portfolio balance being a little higher than our target of around billion we had a modest decrease in prepays in the first quarter but we expect they will pick up in the second quarter we dont expect this to have a significant impact on our duration or the unamortized premium which remains relatively small turning to slide net interest income declined million to million and the net interest margin was a decline of basis points relative to the fourth quarter the negative net impact of lower rates was million and basis points interest income on loans declined million and reduced the margin basis points the major factor was lower interest rates which had a million impact and basis points on the margin also comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 contributing to the decrease were lower balances one less day in the quarter and lower loan fees lower non accrual interest activity and other portfolio dynamics such as a mix shift in the portfolio including an increase in higher quality lower yielding loans provided another headwind a slightly lower yield on the securities portfolio reduced net interest income by million interest on deposits at the fed had a million negative impact or basis points on the margin the lower fed funds interest rate had an impact of million or basis points and higher balances of the fed added million but resulted in a basis point drag on the margin deposit costs declined by million and added basis points to the margin primarily a result of our prudent management of deposit pricing as interest rates declined as i previously discussed finally with lower rates wholesale funding cost declined by million adding basis points to the margin in summary given the nature of our portfolio our loans repriced very quickly also we continue to closely monitor competitive environment and our need for liquidity as we manage deposit pricing slide provides an overview of credit we increased our allowance for credit losses by million to million or of total loans this reflected our expectations for the impacts of covid19 and social distancing as well as the continued pressure on energy we adopted cecl in the first quarter for modeling purposes we used economic forecast through march to inform us as we determined the allowance theres a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate economic impact of the pandemic as well as the effectiveness of the government stimulus packages and payment deferrals therefore we also considered qualitative adjustments based on more severe or benign forecast for certain sectors we considered more severe assumptions for areas where we have the most concern such as those more at risk due to social distancing as well as auto production leveraged lending and energy this forecast includes gdp declining anywhere from to in the second quarter it is important to note that we are starting the cycle with very low levels of criticized and nonaccrual loans as you can see in the table putting energy aside net chargeoffs were only million or basis points in addition total nonperforming loans were a mere basis points and criticized loans remained low at only of total loans as of quarterend energy loans which are outlined on slide were about billion at quarterend and represent of our total loans ep loans make up about of the energy portfolio and energy services which is considered the riskiest segment was only million volatile oil and gas prices have resulted in more stress in the energy portfolio evidenced by increases in criticized and nonaccrual loans as well as chargeoffs therefore we increased our reserve allocation to more than of energy loans spring redeterminations were approximately complete as of march and as of yesterday complete so we are still very early in the process with the decline in energy prices we expect to see a relatively significant decrease in borrowing bases as well as collateral deficiencies as weve done in previous cycles we aim to work with customers to cure deficiencies through a repayment over time our energy customers were acting prudently cutting costs and reducing capex in order to preserve liquidity the ultimate outcome will depend on the duration of the cycle with more than years of serving this industry we have deep expertise and remain focused on supporting our energy customers overall our customers are well positioned and have weathered many cycles slide provides detail on segments we believe pose higher risk in the current environment we are closely monitoring and working with customers in areas where social distancing is having a serious impact such as comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 hotels retail and recreationrelated businesses our exposure to any one of these industries is not significant and there are many areas where we have no exposure such as franchise restaurants or consumer credit cards ive already covered energy in regard to auto production we have a long history of working through economic cycles and twothirds of the loans are to middlemarket companies at quarterend there were only million of nonaccrual loans in this sector we are always closely monitoring our leveraged loans which tend to be with middlemarket relationshipbased customers sponsors management teams and industries we know well also our sweet spot would be in the lower end of the leverage spectrum weve increased our allowance allocation for loans in these areas as curt mentioned we maintain a welldiversified portfolio which is a fundamental part of our credit strategy to help minimize losses during times of stress turning to slide on noninterest income which was impacted by noncustomer activity this includes deferred comp asset returns of a negative million a million decline from last quarter recall this is offset in non interest expenses also during the fourth quarter we benefited from the sale of our hsa business for a gain of million customer derivative income was million a decline of million as record derivative sales of million were offset by a million negative credit valuation adjustment due to the decline in interest rates commercial lending fees decreased million following nearrecord high syndication activity in the fourth quarter and fewer deals in the first quarter due to economic uncertainty there was a million decrease in card fees partly due to lower transaction volume fiduciary income increased million with strong sales note that market related fees are billed on a onemonth lag therefore the recent decline in equities and money market rates is expected to be reflected in the second quarter expenses declined million as shown on slide salaries and benefits decreased million due to a number of factors deferred comp was lower as i mentioned on the previous slide incentive compensation including annual executive stock grants was lower as it is tied to our performance in addition we had a reduction in contingent workers and seasonally lower staff insurance as most employees have not yet met their healthcare deductibles seasonally higher payroll taxes partly offset these reductions in addition outside processing fees decreased million as the new accounting standard resulted in a million reclassification of software expense and recall in the fourth quarter we paid a million vendor transition fee seasonality drove a million decrease in occupancy expense and a million decrease in marketing expense we continue to carefully manage cost as evidenced by our efficiency ratio which remained solid at under in line with current environment comericas conservative approach to capital and liquidity management positions us well to meet our customers needs slide provides an overview of our strong liquidity position and funding base we have ample access to multiple funding sources with of our funding coming from relationshiporiented deposits of which nearly half are non interestbearing deposits at quarterend we had approximately billion on deposit at the fed through the federal home loan bank we have almost billion available to draw at very attractive rates at quarterend we held billion of unencumbered liquid securities in the form of treasuries and mortgage backed securities which had an accumulated unrealized pretax gain of over million finally we have ready access to brokered deposits as well as the discount window of the fed if necessary our capital levels remained strong with an estimated cet1 of as shown on slide in the first quarter we returned a total of million to shareholders including an increase in the dividend to per share and comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 the repurchase of million shares last month we suspended repurchases as we focused on deploying capital to meet customers financial requirements and providing an attractive dividend note that we have elected to defer a portion of the transitional impact of adopting cecl which provided a benefit of basis points to the estimated cet1 ratio as we navigate the current environment we expect our capital levels to remain strong while our first quarter cet1 ratio is below our target we expect to return to this level when the economy improves slide provides our outlook for the second quarter relative to the first quarter we are assuming recessionary conditions including a significant decline in gdp and increases in unemployment given the high degree of uncertainty pertaining to the economic impacts of covid19 as well as the government stimulus we do not feel comfortable providing a full year outlook at this time we expect average loans to grow with increases in mortgage banker due to spring home sales and continued strong refi volumes also we expect elevated line usage to continue as we support customers liquidity needs including loan advances under the governments paycheck protection plan lending program partially offsetting this we anticipate businesses to have lower financing needs as a result of reduced working capital and capex requirements we expect average deposit growth in conjunction with customers conserving cash and receiving distributions under the stimulus program we believe this will mostly be offset by business customers using funds to meet high operating needs the net impact from rates alone on net interest income is expected to be million in the second quarter relative to the first quarter based on our autonomous libor forecast this expectation includes the full quarter effect of the march fed cuts combined with the actions weve taken to lower deposit rates of course actual results will vary depending on a variety of factors such as movement in libor which remains somewhat elevated relative to the fed funds through quarterend loan growth is expected to provide a partial offset to this rate headwind credit quality is expected to reflect the economic environment which is highly uncertain and therefore makes it impossible to provide clear guidance at this time of course the largest variable is the duration of severity of covid19 and the resulting effects the current credit reserve was based on recessionary scenarios however we are in unchartered waters in addition cecl may cause greater volatility in our provision we expect noninterest income to benefit from an increasing card fees with higher transaction volumes as customers receive the government stimulus funds partly offset by lower merchant and commercial card activity on the other hand a reduction in economic activity and lower marketrelated fees is expected to have an impact on derivatives investment banking fiduciary and brokerage activity deferred comp which was a negative million in the first quarter and was offset in expenses is hard to predict and is not assumed to repeat we remain focused on controlling expenses and are closely managing discretionary spending however we expect to see a rise in outside processing tied to growth in card fees also we expect covid19related expenses to rise with increased compensation for employees who are not able to work remotely as well as measures weve taken to protect employees such as providing masks and intense cleaning of facilities in addition we expect seasonal increases in annual merit staff insurance and marketing as far as capital i mentioned on the previous slide we have suspended the share repurchase program and are focused on meeting customers financing needs as well as maintaining an attractive dividend now ill turn the call back to curt comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim over our years history we have managed through many economic cycles we have demonstrated our resiliency and our ability to work cohesively and leverage our ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit in order to persevere to the great depression two world wars and the great financial crisis we have a longtenured experienced team which is able to adapt to the rapidly changing environment as well as support our customers as they navigate these challenging times it is at times like these that you build and solidify loyal customer relationships our geographic footprint is diverse and we lack reliance on any one industry as discussed we significantly increased our credit reserve in the first quarter of course it is impossible to gauge the ultimate impact of the pandemic but we believe our conservative underwriting standards prudent customer selection and history of superior credit performance through the last recession demonstrates our ability to weather the current cycle we are also focused on maintaining our expense discipline we look forward to returning to business as normal and we are taking steps to ensure we are prepared to serve our customers when the economy rebounds with strong liquidity and capital levels we are able to meet our customers growing financial needs as appropriate and are focused on maintaining an attractive dividend for our shareholders in summary during times of stress we believe our conservative approach to banking serves us well and now we would be happy to take your questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question will come from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead with your question john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi as you looked at the loan loss reserve and as you decided on the magnitude of the additions i just want to get some color on how you thought about throughcycle losses as particularly how that would break out for the overall loan book but also for energy how would you think about that that could play out this time around thanks comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc pete peter w guilfoile a chief credit officer executive vice president comerica inc good morning john cecl its not a stress test its not about calculating your throughcycle losses its really an accounting exercise and so we did our best to build our reserves appropriately given what cecl calls for i think we feel really good about the number we came up with we used the most recent economic scenarios that were available we even kept our books open a couple days to make sure we got that and i think that ratio is a really solid number and we feel good about where we ended up john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you great and then when it comes to the dividend i just heard your comment about your focus on maintaining an attractive dividend so i guess just give us your thoughts around your ability to maintain it as the credit pressures weigh here and considering the hit to your common equity that we saw this quarter im also curious where do you see your common equity ratio playing out in a stressed scenario thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc john im going to start answering your question and ask jim to fill in a few details first let me just reiterate what i think many of you already know and thats that we have done a very good job of returning capital to our shareholders the last few years both in terms of our buyback as well as raising our dividend and so we remain focused on leveraging capital really first to meet loan grades but we also want to provide really a healthy and competitive dividend to our shareholders and obviously right now there are a lot of unknowns a lot of uncertainty were uncertain around for the duration and depth of the economic cycle and how long the covid19 situation will last but today based on what we know we feel comfortable on our capital position and our dividend and ill turn to jim for some more color james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc i would just supplement that with we do stress test for dividend and thats a ongoing exercise we do at least once a year with very strong levels of parent company cash which is very important when you want to maintain the dividend we took very healthy reserves this quarter and we still have strong capital so we feel good about that and then when i look at the earnings projections as things start to normalize with credit we certainly believe the dividend can be managed within the context of those earnings even in a low rate environment so even though no one can predict how future might play out with covid over the next several quarters what were seeing in the near and medium term we feel good about the dividend and believe that can be maintained john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks and just a little more can you remind us what your internal target is for your common equity tier ratio comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc our cet1 target is and thats all weve publicly disclosed john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great all right thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you john operator your next question is from the line of ken with morgan stanley please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc ken good morning ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc good morning thanks for taking my question i guess maybe starting off just in terms of the energy portfolio i obviously saw you guys increased your reserve to over can you just help us understand like from our perspective you have a very large reserve on the energy portfolio another bank for example might have a much lower reserve on their energy portfolio how do we from the outside know whether the reserve is because youre being much more conservative than other banks perhaps or because the credit quality of your portfolio might not be the same as theirs thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc pete peter w guilfoile a chief credit officer executive vice president comerica inc ken as you know with cecl the main driver particularly this quarter maybe more in any other quarter is the economic forecast and so the economic forecast had a lot to do with the reserves that we decided to build for energy and so we made some assumptions about where our oil prices are going to be over a reasonable and supportable period the other point that we just gave as kind of a gut check was we felt this felt worse than what we went through a few years ago and we decided that we wanted to make sure that that number was above where our reserves were in the last downturn so that exceeds the reserves that we had last time and we didnt need all those reserves last time but we felt the severity here was worse ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 and do you feel that portfolio quality is worse this time around less severity or peter w guilfoile a chief credit officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah no i feel the opposite for a couple reasons ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay peter w guilfoile a chief credit officer executive vice president comerica inc one is i think our ep borrowers are for the most part less leveraged we have a lot less energy services than we had in the last downturn energy services contributed of our credit losses in the last downturn with only of the portfolio today were out of that business and then i think the most important factor really is our portfolio is smaller its about doing too smaller than what we had going into the last downturn and i think that is probably the biggest factor of all ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay that helps out and then just one last question in terms of the nim impact i noticed obviously your guidance is based on libor basis points it looks like its down about basis points already this quarter can you just remind us like what the sensitivity is to say i dont know a basis point reduction on onemonth libor on the nii thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jim james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah i can probably offer you a very crude rule of thumb just in fairness because i know you guys are trying to get the models right obviously libor has been jumping around quite a bit it got lower and then went back over basis points now its back down again so depending on how covid plays out will ultimately dictate the stress on the economy where libor ends up at but you could probably apply to that about a quarter for the in terms of libor and i would warn you thats a very crude rule of thumb it depends on when during the month libor might go up or down and resets occur but just to be transparent that hopefully gives you a little bit more information ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it it does all right thank you very much curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you ken comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 operator your next question is from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning everybody curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc first just a followup on your commentary around the energy reserve how much of that is specific reserves and how much is qualitative of the curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc pete peter w guilfoile a chief credit officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah by specific you mean cited right and so thats our steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc for specific credits rather than i mean because youre implying that a lot of the build versus peers may have come from just your model assumptions so im trying to delineate between whats model whats specific to the individual credits peter w guilfoile a chief credit officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah yeah i understand its a little bit more complicated than that because we also increased our loss given default in the process and so that did make it really applestoapples on what portion was just driven by the standard versus the qualitative but it was very little of it was cited reserves because our criticized at the end of the quarter was still reasonably low steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay got you and then i may have missed this but did you give the portion of loan deferrals the balances of loans that were deferred in the quarter peter w guilfoile a chief credit officer executive vice president comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 yeah so so far we have deferred payments on loans totaling billion to borrowers and the average deferral period is days steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay got you and then finally given that you did report a loss in the first quarter do you guys need to secure special regulatory approval to pay the dividend and is that done already james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc so we are always in communication with our regulators and they are aware of our actions and how were proceeding so we dont disclose details there but ill say were always in ongoing contact with them steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay fair enough thanks for taking my questions curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you steven operator your next question is from the line of jennifer demba with suntrust please go ahead with your question curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you good morning hi followup on the deferral question if you looked at your slide deck with the listing of the kind of greater at risk portfolios what percentage of those borrowers have asked for deferrals curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jennifer i dont have the breakdown my sense of it is that a clear number of them would have come from those carveout portfolios but i would say also many were really borrowers that really didnt need deferrals they looked at asking for the deferral is just really an insurance policy for their liquidity and so i wouldnt necessarily jump to the conclusion that all of the deferrals that we granted were to troubled borrowers at all jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you so much comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 operator your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead with your question curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi hey well you didnt plan for an oil environment like this i cant imagine i mean i know theres some flukes with these negative oil prices but it seems like the oil prices as you look out ahead would be below the level where the feds stress test takes place and it might be below the level where you have your own stress test so can you talk about the impact of the oil price like where it is today and what that could mean for losses and how that differs from the past curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah sure mike as you know its not so important where oil is today or next week or even a month from now its where its going to settle in over the longer period of time and so the and thats because twothirds of our borrowers can generate positive free cash flow before capex with oil really in the only about of our oil portfolio needs oil to be in the mid or higher to generate positive free cash flow before capex the more i would call it intermediate concern is going to be liquidity were using much lower price decks and given where prices have gone over the last month to determine what our borrowers borrowing bases are and so as those borrowing bases come down some of our borrowers are going to get squeezed from the liquidity standpoint in this environment more than ever we need to work with them we need to bridge them to a point where prices stabilize demand stabilizes supply stabilizes so that we can get them to a point where they can just function in a more normal environment so thats the way we kind of see this playing out im not so focused on where prices are in right now today but try to bridge to a point where prices stabilize mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats a good clarification and working with our energy analyst he had a couple of questions that might help us bank analysts so and i can go back in the queue if i need to but what is the level of utilization for your energy borrowers public versus private curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc well thats a good question i dont think we have it broken down that way thats something we could get but i dont have that mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc no thats fine and whats the process for covenants if they are breached comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc no well again its when youre were going to be triaging the portfolio and it is not one blanket answer but the bottom line here is not just comerica but all the banks were going to be working with our borrowers to just get through it and the ones that continue to be supportive were going to be very supportive of them mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay last two reports that banks are creating shell companies to own the assets is comerica considering doing anything like that are you allowed to curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yes to own but not to operate were not a big enough energy player that we would consider operating energy assets but if we need to have an equity position in them were prepared to do that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then lastly limits that you can place on eps on outspending cash by leaning on revolvers curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc im sorry mike can you say it one more time mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc what are the limits that comerica can place on eps on outspending cash by leaning on revolvers if any i mean what kind of control do you have over the borrowers and what they do with the money curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc are you talking about the energy portfolio still mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah so there are not a lot of restrictions in that regard but if they are using the money for distributions or something thats not going to be accretive to their borrowing bases they know that wouldnt sit very well with the banks and i cant imagine any of our borrowers doing that in fact i would say ive been really pretty pleased with the way our borrowers are handling this so far theyre really cutting back on expenses theyre cutting back on capex they are using whatever little free cash flow they have to pay down debt and we have not seen very many defensive draws at all comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so one last thought again this is the issue in the stock market today at the moment oil prices tanking youre exposed to oil your kind of one thought you really want us to have as those who own or analyze comerica would be what curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc i would say were going to get through this we have a very long 170plus year history of getting through a lot of different downturns well get through this one as well we have a diversified portfolio energy is only a very small piece of our portfolio in fact exenergy our portfolio is really in great shape our chargeoffs were pretty nominal this quarter again so we go into this downturn with a really so i think a position of strength from a credit quality standpoint we got line issues in particular energy we got our eye on the social distancing portfolios but as we work through this with our customers i think well get through it fine mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you mike operator your next question is from the line of erika najarian with bank of america please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning good morning my first question is a followup to john and steves question on the dividend my understanding is that automatic restrictions on the dividend dont kick in until you breach that cet1 level and then the restriction is a payout on trailing eligible net income im wondering if the same rules apply on tier capital if you sell below and as we go forward what are the rwa considerations that you have on hand in order to prevent further erosion in capital james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc right yeah good morning erika yeah the same restrictions do apply to all levels of capital so it would be for tier and as you know and i think youve asked in previous calls tier is our binding constraint we dont anticipate getting down obviously we get them very strong at over bps of that level the estimated again unknown where covid is going to take the industry but we do not anticipate going down to that level but you did rightly point out that riskweighted assets is probably the biggest variable its got the potential to move the capital ratios even more in provision or net income comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 and were watching that this is a very different type of crisis we know that in the last great recession we had some initial line draws but ultimately companies delevered and riskweighted assets shrank and that really drove up capital ratios its unclear if thats going to occur in this crisis its more of a demand destruction crisis its not clear that customers will delever some obviously have drawn up but it just remains to be seen where that goes so riskweighted assets will drive a lot of this we are appropriately rightsizing comerica with customer commitments were there for them but where theres larger commitments than perhaps need to be we are talking to customers about just making sure those are rightsized to meet their needs and then well just have to monitor the riskweighted assets well do the right things for the customers and well see where demand from all this goes over the next year curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jim i might just add and maybe ask peter to add a little color just around what were seeing in terms of draw activity with customers but our first target is always taking care of our customers thats why were here were a relationship bank and were going to make sure that our customers are taken care of and those that are operating well and those that are working through difficult situations as pete alluded to earlier but peter peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director business bankcomerica bank comerica inc well i would just add to what jim said earlier on the call that we saw utilization go up into the first quarter and a little bit into april but since then its really kind of tapered off and i think our customers are well positioned going into  and the rest of the year so i think that we havent seen a whole lot more active defensive draws or drawing down lines than we did sort of that first end of the quarter and at april erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you and my second question is everybody is grappling with what cumulative losses can look like in the industry and comerica has clearly had a very strong history on ci so if im looking at the regulatory data correctly cumulative losses of in and in ci and in cumulative losses of and im wondering if we carve out your energy portfolio which is clearly uniquely stressed if those are good starting points for twoyear cumulative losses as we look forward in terms of the type of recession that were going to have and the impact on your ci portfolio peter w guilfoile a chief credit officer executive vice president comerica inc so erika let me give you a couple data points and hopefully this would help so first of all just comparing ourselves to the great recession this recession every recession of course is going to be different and of course weve got the social distancing segment of the portfolio which is different this time around that we didnt have to be concerned about in but if you just compared our book today to we have made a very concerted effort over the last to years to make it more recession resilient and so if you look at the lines of business that were what we call recessionsusceptible going into they totaled of the portfolio today weve reduced that by so now those businesses that we consider most susceptible to recession are only of the portfolio today and that includes energy energy is in that kind of that if you just take a look at our reserves today our peak reserves are right about from a dollar comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 standpoint right where they are today now the coverage ratio was higher in when the coverage ratio peaked but thats because primarily due to the downturn our loans ran off a bit but from a reserve standpoint the billion that we have in reserves right now is very comparable to what we had in the downturn and then lastly some stress test numbers our last dfast was that was billion we have had two stress tests with our models since then one in which was billion and then one in at billion so our reserve levels today as a percentage of those stress test losses are respectively so i think the takeaway there is i think our portfolio is better positioned than we were going into the last downturn and i think were better reserved as well erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and just one last question just a little help in understanding ppnr as clearly thats the first line of defense in terms of absorbing provisions does your net interest income outlook for include the impact of ppp loans and also as we think about your card fees clearly theres going to be lower transaction volumes but cant the direct express business benefit from the stimulus packages and could that be an offset from the pain that were seeing or were modeling in terms of the exit rate in transaction volume james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah erika number one the ppp impact we made an attempt to factor that in to the overall outlook but its really unknown in terms of how its going to affect income because a huge variable with ppp is how long loans are outstanding when they pay off how many are forgiven so we took a stab at it but i think theres a lot of uncertainty with all the banks in terms of how its all really going to impact the financials and of course were primarily focused on just making sure were taking care of customers period regarding direct express in my remarks you might recall that i mentioned that we expect card fees to actually be up in the second quarter so stimulus payments being processed is a component of that and so we have factored that in erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you erika operator your next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead with your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning everyone curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc good morning just in terms of thinking about your diversity you guys happen to also have a lot of specific industry expertise in areas that might be pretty severely impacted so im wondering if you could kind of walk through how mortgage banker auto floor plan the equity lines business tech and life sciences can you just talk about what youre seeing and hearing in those businesses and to the extent that you expect volumes to change just underneath the line draws in each of those areas thanks peter w guilfoile a chief credit officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah so i can take it from a credit standpoint maybe peter can take it from more a revenue standpoint i mean the mortgage banker and equity fund services businesses are fairly low risk businesses there our mortgage banker portfolio as you know is all conventional mortgages our source of repayment on those is the secondary markets they could get disrupted for a short period of time thats okay weve seen that before weve worked through that with our borrowers and eventually when the markets stabilize again they were able to reduce their warehouse lines equity fund services very clean portfolio the lps are institutional very strong type of borrowers we would not expect to see credit issues at all develop in that portfolio technology and life sciences tend to be up and down not just in cycles like this but it can be up and down when cycles are strong and so for instance when the economy is strong multiples are high and sometimes our venture capital firms are buying companies at very high multiples that results in chargeoffs for us so in kind of a more just more difficult market for equities it sometimes translates into better results from a credit quality standpoint in that portfolio automotive would be certainly one we have our eye on those companies are very volume dependent they have high fixed cost and so when auto volumes drop off we tend to see some migration there i would say though that weve got a lot of confidence in our people in michigan that manage the risk in their portfolios theyve been through a lot of downturns and theyre really good from a customer selection standpoint and knowing how to work with the borrowers i cant remember if there was another one that you had mentioned but peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director business bankcomerica bank comerica inc those were them but ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc those were them thanks peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director business bankcomerica bank comerica inc yeah the only thing from an activity level is the same order that pete went out i mean mortgage is clearly still very very active youve got less activity obviously in tls and efs and then in the auto space theres not cars really being made right now so clearly youre seeing a slowdown in the activity out there but the same order that pete described is also what were seeing on activity comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and one followup on the cre side of things not a big book for you guys but i remember we talked about this in and with regard to the secondary impacts around energy and cre can you just talk about just your views of just how that might play through this time in terms of secondary effects and the impact on the commercial real estate book thanks peter w guilfoile a chief credit officer executive vice president comerica inc sure the commercial real estate book is dominated by a class a infill multifamily construction its a really good product in downturns it tends to hold up really well and thats why we like it the areas that we avoid are office which is obviously something thats going to get is getting hit very hard right now got us a little bit of retail about million of that but for the most part very strong developers low loan to values last time at least going into a downturn i think our occupancy rates were in the mid or something like that so its a pretty strong but small portfolio we do have multifamily in houston houston obviously is going to be ground zero with whats going on in energy we do have some history there in the last downturn we did not have a single loss in our multifamily portfolio we were able to work through that with our borrowers and most of these developers theyre national developers they have equity partners with deep pockets we have to equity in each of the projects and theyre not going to walk away from these projects given their investment and the fact that weve got a long history with them of knowing how they handle things in downturn so we feel pretty confident about commercial real estate portfolio as a whole ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you ken operator your next question is from the line of gary tenner with da davidson please go ahead with your question curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning gary gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thank you good morning so you gave the detail im sorry on the energy portfolio reserve being over i was wondering if theres any of the other atrisk industries that youd be willing to disclose where youve got the reserve levels at comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 peter w guilfoile a chief credit officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah gary we didnt go into that much detail i think the number that we are very feel really good about and i think its the most important number is the coverage and i think its going to stand pretty tall relative to our peers especially when you consider that banks that have larger consumer books than us are going to should have larger reserves because thats because of cecl our consumer book is very small so when you compare applestoapples commercial reserves to commercial reserves i think our reserves are going to be amongst the highest in the industry gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay and then just a followup on your you made the comment on the companies that are coming to you to request deferrals i forgot the percentage but a high percentage seemed to be those that didnt necessarily need them but were looking at them as insurance just to clarify are you providing deferrals in those scenarios peter w guilfoile a chief credit officer executive vice president comerica inc we have and if they were to come back to us again we would have to reevaluate them in days to see if they really need them but yeah weve been very accommodative this quarter with just the amount of turmoil thats out there we just felt it was the right thing to do and we were happy to accommodate our customers curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc and gary i just would say this is curt that i would apply that same lens across all of our customers so whether they are a retail consumer or customer or even a private banking wealth management customer or a commercial customer in any of our commercial channel we have really tried to be accommodative on the front end because of the great deal of uncertainty and then hopefully customers behave well which we think they will through this cycle and we always address the situations where maybe they are not but we wanted to be as flexible and as accommodative because we think its the right thing to do for the country gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co all right thank you operator your next question is from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning hey good morning just a real quick one kind of following up on kens questions you were talking about economic activity im wondering if you and really by line of business can you talk about it by market i know that it sounds like texas is preparing to open back up michigan is a bit more restrictive and comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 california might be somewhere in the middle but talk about whether or not you think youve seen activity trough in some of your markets and what kind of expectations you have in a place like texas when it opens back up curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jon first of all obviously this impact is broad and its really across all markets in almost all industries not just those that are dealing with social distancing sort of disruption so there is sort of broad impact a broad impact on gdp broad impact on unemployment from a sort of consumer level and so all that has to play out we do believe our sort of economic view is that the economy should start to stabilize as we get into third quarter assuming that we see some of the trends and the covid abatement that were anticipating and then as we kind of go through the year start to see some more normalization and certainly a much stronger sort of pace to gdp heading into a lot of that supported by what is just unprecedented massive physical and sort of monetary stimulus kind of going back to each of the markets ill make a couple of comments on all three of them texas is a little bit unique in that its facing the dual challenge not only of the covid situation but of the oversupply of crude oil that pete has been talking about but having said all that it does seem like texas got ahead of things early and at some point there seems to be a movement from the governor towards some more normalization and some selective reopening so well see how that plays out id also say just to texas today while theres certainly the energy issue it definitely is a more diverse economy than it was last years ago during the great recession and as you know weve seen just very significant new job creation and net population inflow so texas will take a blow here from energy and covid but i do think the longer term its better positioned than it was during the last great recession california seems to have gotten a little bit ahead of the quarantine early there was some recent news out that maybe the numbers for la were higher than originally reported and i would say that in california we also are seeing some opportunities theres always opportunity that get created on the it side as people are doing more automation in technology and then lastly i just would say as ive said previously california is a very resilient economy very diverse economy sixth largest economy in the world and so i think longer term well be okay michigan has more concentration of issues and took a more restrictive quarantine early on to deal with that to deal with the covid impact i think the state is dealing with some of the impacts of extended plant closures certainly in the manufacturing sector we talked about the decline in auto sales as well and we would expect auto sales to probably fall again in april but then maybe start to stabilize in the summer as hopefully we start to come out as the people start to move around but id say the same thing about michigan and you look at where the state is today versus where they were years ago its definitely moving to a more diverse economy weve had a tremendous resurgence in the core of detroit and weve seen some population inflow especially in most millennials into the state and so every state is a little bit different situation certainly the reopening will be governed by the governors and so well have to work with each state related to that and we have been working now for a few weeks on our own reopening plan but the good news is whether we go back to a full throttle reopening or maybe a phased reopening it has not stopped us from doing business and we have been able to operate well in a more remote environment with some of our colleagues about of our colleagues working remotely and then certainly some who were banking centers et cetera that are still in more direct facetoface contact with customers comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thanks a lot curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc
