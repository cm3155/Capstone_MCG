direct you to the reconciliation of these measures in the earnings materials that are available on our website comericacom now ill turn the call over to curt who will begin on slide curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today we reported second quarter earnings of million or per share outperforming the first quarter on both a reported and an adjusted basis although average loans declined our targeted focus on responsible growth drove an inflection in balances throughout the quarter in an uncertain economic and political environment customer sentiment appeared slightly less optimistic than last quarter however a number of our businesses saw positive momentum and we believe our pipeline supports our group outlook as expected net interest margin started to rebound and both noninterest income and noninterest expenses improved credit quality remained strong reflecting our prudent underwriting discipline being a responsible company is deeply embedded in our culture and in june we published our 16th annual corporate responsibility report detailing our commitments to this important topic we remain proud of our efforts to prioritize our employees and communities once again us news recognized us as one of the best companies to work for and we were named one of the most communityminded organizations we feel responsible business is a good business and we take pride in the unique role we play in supporting our markets second quarter financial highlights are on slide average loans were impacted by muted first quarter demand but balances increased consistently throughout the quarter our deliberate first quarter reduction in brokered time deposits drove a majority of the decline in average deposits however we also continue to see pressure on noninterestbearing balances as we near what we believe may be the peak of the rate cycle the decline in net interest income reflected both lower fed deposits and average loans chargeoffs remain below historical averages at basis points and our loan loss reserve declined modestly even excluding the net benefit from lower notable items both noninterest income and noninterest expenses saw favorable trends taxes increased due to higher income and less of a benefit from discrete items and our estimated cet1 of remained above our strategic target while we remain in an elevated rate environment we think the favorable customerrelated trends coupled with the expected structural benefit to net interest income in the coming quarters positions us well now ill turn the call over to jim to review our second quarter financial results in more detail jim james j herzog chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide trailing effects of rationalization efforts coupled with soft demand at the start of the year impacted average loan balances in the second quarter low utilization trends persisted in equity fund services although balances rebounded in june and elevated rates continue to impact wealth management loans commercial real estate utilization trended higher however comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 periodend balances remained flat to the first quarter we have been purposefully managing commitments and originations in this space for several quarters and we expect to begin to see growth subside in this business total loan balances grew consistently throughout the quarter with periodend loans up over billion national dealer services contributed to quarterend growth with elevated balances due in part to the cyberattack that impacted dealerships nationwide in june but we also saw increases across most business lines our pipeline remains strong and supports our expectation for continued growth moving to slide average deposit balances declined billion but almost of the decrease was attributed to lower brokered time deposits pressure on noninterestbearing balances increased relative to trends we observed in the latter half of the first quarter as customers utilize funds to support ongoing business activity or reduce borrowings taxrelated seasonality impacted select businesses such as municipalities while we saw some deposit remixing at the customer level it did not appear to be the biggest driver even with noninterestbearing balance trends and ongoing success in winning new interestbearing deposit relationships we believe our noninterestbearing mix remained peer leading averaging for the quarter interestbearing deposit cost improved basis points driven by lower brokered time deposits and increases in customer deposit pricing continued to flatten as rates decline we expect to see an inflection point in deposit balances mix and costs in the meantime we remain encouraged by our success in growing interestbearing deposits and continued pricing discipline periodend balances in our securities portfolio on slide declined with continued paydowns and maturities as the marktomarket adjustment remained relatively flat we expect continued decline in balances through at least the end of the year turning to slide net interest income decreased million to million driven by lower fed deposits and loan balances partially offset by decline in wholesale funding impacts from the bsby cessation drove million of the decline as we recognized a million noncash loss in the second quarter compared to a million increase in the first quarter as a reminder you can find the expected future bsby impacts in the appendix to the slides normalization of our cash position drove an increase in net interest margin for the quarter as shown on slide successful execution of our interest rate strategy and the composition of our balance sheet positions us favorably for a gradual basis points or basis points on average decline in interest rates by strategically managing our swap and securities portfolios while considering balance sheet dynamics we intend to maintain our insulated position over time credit quality remained strong as highlighted on slide net chargeoffs of bps decline for the second consecutive quarter and remain well below our normal range although customers continued to navigate high borrowing costs and inflation we saw an improvement in criticized loans concentrated in our core middle market businesses nonaccrual loans ticked up slightly but still remained below historical averages we did not observe any new emerging pressures and metrics within our incrementally monitored portfolios remain relatively consistent with a reduction in the allowance for credit losses to of total loans we continue to believe ongoing migration will remain manageable comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 on slide second quarter noninterest income of million increased million although a majority of the increase was related to the impact of bsby cessation in the first quarter we were encouraged to see growth across most customer related categories capital markets income grew in each product including ma advisory services as a result of the new team we put in place last year fiduciary income saw seasonal tax related increases and brokerage income benefited from investments in our new platform for comerica financial advisors we were pleased to see successful revenue growth associated with our strategic focus on noninterest income and continue to prioritize these key investments expenses on slide improved million over the prior quarter salaries and benefits declined million with seasonally lower stockbased compensation as the biggest driver fdic expense came down due to the large special assessment in the first quarter other expenses declined including consulting operational losses and asset impairment costs associated with real estate rationalization partially offset by seasonally higher advertising overall expense management remains a high priority as we continue to seek opportunities to drive positive operating leverage and efficiency as shown on slide higher profitability coupled with conservative capital management drove increases across all of our key capital ratios our estimated cet1 grew to and adjusting for the aoci optout our estimated cet1 remained above required regulatory minimums and buffers despite volatility throughout the quarter at quarter end aoci remained relatively flat as we think about ongoing capital management we need to continue to monitor aoci movement our loan outlook and regulations as they evolve before moving to the outlook as indicated on slide we recently received preliminary notification from the fiscal service that comerica bank was not selected to continue serving as the financial agent for the direct express prepaid debit card program following the expiration of our contract early next year this process remains fluid as contract negotiations are not yet final but at this time we do not expect that comerica bank will retain the business longterm as detailed on the slide we recognized noninterest income and card fees but that is generally offset by expenses associated with managing the program the financial value has been in the noninterestbearing deposit balances related to monthly benefits funded on the cards which have grown over time and averaged billion in the second quarter as we have discussed in the past there are various potential scenarios with regards to the timing and mechanics of the deposit transition and we expect more detail in the coming quarters as terms become final however our experience with this program leads us to believe this transition may be longer than shorter and we do not currently anticipate an impact to deposit balances noninterest income or expenses while we have been honored to manage this important program we see this as an opportunity to refocus and reprioritize resources towards targeted deposit strategies more aligned with our core relationship operating model several of these key initiatives are listed on slide and leverage proven expertise coupled with strategic investments with the goal of driving core deposit growth and consistent funding over time as an example we have been leaning into our competitive position as the leading bank for business to expand our focus within small business expected growth in this space should enhance the granularity and consistency of our deposit profile and we were encouraged to see our investments drive favorable customer trends for the quarter comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 select talent acquisition and business optimization activities in treasury management and payments have been designed to further capitalize on our strong core product set and should allow us to deliver more comprehensive liquidity solutions to our customers through our experience with direct express we have developed competitive card capabilities that we are already leveraging to win new relationships online enhancements within retail were intended to further improve the user experience while expanding our customer reach finally we see opportunities to leverage our existing delivery model strong product set and industry knowledge to further target deposit rich customers which should help drive stable funding opportunities in short we are very excited about the deposit initiatives we are executing on and look forward to continuing to prioritize deposit growth as a key strategic focus our outlook for is on slide we project full year average loans declined or grow point to point from yearend to trailing effects from our strategic optimization efforts and muted demand across the industry dampened our outlook slightly however our strong pipeline and momentum still supports broadbased growth expectations in the second half of the year full year average deposits are projected to be down from or down point to point we expect average brokered time deposits to be relatively consistent from full year to full year although we anticipate some level of continued cyclical pressure on noninterestbearing balances and ongoing success in winning new interestbearing deposits we expect to maintain a favorable deposit mix in the upper the combination of noninterestbearing deposit trends and lower average loans impacts our net interest income outlook as we now project a decline yearoveryear on a quarterly basis we expect those same deposit and loan pressures and the negative impact from bsby cessation to drive a to decline in net interest income adjusting for bsby third quarter net interest income is only expected to decline a modest as we believe we are at the cyclical low point we also believe deposit costs will continue to increase slightly until rates begin to decline credit quality remains strong and successful recoveries helped drive lower net chargeoffs this quarter with persistent elevated rates and inflationary pressures we believe modest migration is possible however we expect it to remain manageable given our strong results to date we forecast full year net chargeoffs to approach but remain below the lower end of our normal to basis point range we expect noninterest income to grow approximately to on a reported basis which would be down year to year when adjusting for bsby and the impact of the ameriprise transition as detailed in the appendix third quarter noninterest income is expected to decline to driven largely by lower projected noncustomer income within the second quarter we recognized a million gain due to our derivative related to the visa class b exchange program and benefited from smaller valuation adjustments accounted for in other income we project lower fhlb dividends consistent with lower wholesale funding and we expect risk management income to decline based on the forward curve and our hedge position despite these noncustomer trends we remained very encouraged about our customerrelated momentum and investments to grow fee income over time full year noninterest expenses are expected to decline to on a reported basis to grow after adjusting for special fdic assessments expense recalibration modernization and the accounting impact from the ameriprise transition comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 third quarter noninterest expenses are expected to increase to over the relatively lower second quarter levels as we intend to reinvest savings from our expense calibration efforts into head count aligned with our risk management and strategic priorities we also expect to see elevated occupancy expense associated with transitioning our corporate facilities and seasonally higher taxes maintenance and repair with an ongoing focus on expense discipline we continued to seek opportunities to offset or selffund emerging pressures even with the strong projected loan growth in the second half of the year we expect our cet1 ratio to remain well above our strategic target through yearend we will continue to monitor aoci and the regulatory environment as we take a conservative approach to share repurchases in despite some near term cyclical pressures we expect continued momentum in the second half of the year to position us well for now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim we are proud of our second quarter results and find the more recent loan and fee income growth trends coupled with our overall earnings trajectory to be compelling as highlighted on slide we feel we have a unique value proposition and it starts with our strong foundation of credit capital and liquidity from that foundation we execute on a diversified strategy across select markets and businesses designed to mitigate risk and deliver enhanced returns over time tying our strong foundation together with our differentiated strategy we feel we are well positioned for future growth we expect meaningful structural tailwinds to net interest income due to anticipated maturities and repayments within our swap and securities portfolio our strategic investments are designed to drive consistent capitalefficient income and we saw encouraging results from those investments this quarter finally we believe our balance sheet is well positioned for responsible profitable growth as we leverage our demonstrated strength as a commercial lender and prioritize our targeted deposit initiatives while the market remains focused on the timing and magnitude of rate cuts we feel we have positioned our balance sheet to drive longterm value regardless of the rate environment we appreciate your time this morning and well be happy to take your questions comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you well now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question today is coming from ken usdin from jefferies your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys look id like to follow up on the direct express and just ask you you mentioned that it could be delayed to some point so im just wondering if you can walk us through the steps from here when do you think youll know when that start point is and then i think the most important is the billion of average deposits what would be the natural trajectory of time for those to kind of go to zero in the scenario you actually dont keep them all even under the transition at start point thanks peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah ken its peter so at this point all of this indication from the fiscal service is preliminary so what the next few months looks like will sort of be to be determined and we hope over the next couple of quarters to get a little more clarity on what the transition does look like i would tell you our focus is on working really closely with the fiscal service to make sure that this is a very smooth transition for the customer base here thats really important to us and i know its important to them as well and so we want to be sure that were able to execute on that for them and as far as the timeline of what the deposits look like and when they leave as we have said for quite a while now we believe that to be a longer time period rather than a shorter time period thats about as much clarity as i can give to you on it because we just dont really know i would tell you that our experience having managed this program for a very long time now is that this is a significant transition there is million cardholders and that this would take a long period of time so thats going to be something that we will learn hopefully in the coming quarters and as we get more clarity on it our intention would be to provide that clarity to you as well and i would tell you also that we continue to be very focused on running our playbook for our relationship model as curt and jim have said in our comments we feel like weve got a whole lot of ways to manage this on a goforward basis for the company and feel like well be able to redirect these resources to be more focused on what we really do as a leading bank for business ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then just biggerpicture question in the scenario where you dont keep it and even if there is a long tail it still could be a decent hit to earnings power how much does this change just overall if at all strategic thinking about where the company is going in terms of adjusting to a different potential earnings power level comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc good morning ken its jim i would start out by saying that it is absolutely our intention to replace these deposits over time as i look at it shortterm of course therell be no effect we do think it will be somewhat of an elongated transition longterm we do expect to replace these deposits and we expect to replace them with core customer deposits that as peter and curt said probably better fit our business model mediumterm well wait and see how the transition goes but over time it is our expectation to replace these with core deposits and minimize the impact potentially no impact over the longterm having said that to the extent there is a bit of a transition in the mediumterm we do start with a great balance sheet low levels of wholesale funding low loanto deposit ratio we dont think it affects us strategically and i would just emphasize that it is our intention over time to replace these deposits to remove any impact to longterm profitability ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks ken operator thank you next question today is coming from chris mcgratty from kbw your line is now live christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning just following up on the question thinking about how the balance sheet you may react with your balance sheet youve got a bond portfolio that throws off a lot of cash is one im trying to get a better handle on is that scenario replace the deposits with interestbearing over time which is a hit or selling perhaps low yielding bonds which would perhaps be less of an impact any color on that would be great james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc good morning chris its jim we do think the bond portfolio will continue to run down through the end of the year and generate cash the way i think of it as that bond portfolio will essentially fund our loan growth between now and the end of the year perhaps early next year i wouldnt necessarily lean on the bond portfolio for anything related to the direct express program which is really again a longerterm issue and well certainly be buying securities by the time we have some type of longer transition for direct express so i view the bond portfolio as more of a shorterterm tactic to fund our loan growth at this point comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and maybe im not sure how much you can comment but was it pricing what was it that you think having had this relationship for many years what do you think it was that drove the decision not to be selected peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah chris this is peter you know quite candidly we really cant comment and dont plan to comment on sort of what the decision process was or wasnt that the physical service made what we can tell you is that we did submit what we felt like was a very competitive bid with our full understanding of this program like i said for a long period of time and the complexities that come with it so were very proud of how weve managed this all of these years and we felt very good about what we submitted as being the right thing for both parties and including the consumers and at the end of the day the decision process is sort of left up to the fiscal service and not one that were going to able to comment on christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you operator thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks chris operator operator instructions our next question today is coming from bernard von gizycki from deutsche bank your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning bernard bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys good morning could you talk to your interest rate sensitivity analysis on page of the deck youre liability sensitive and the forward curve assumptions have changed since and i wanted color on your underlying assumptions just how we kind of think about it in the forward and then just i know youve kind of outlined about million benefits from less drags and swaps in and wondering if there are any updates there james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah good morning bernard its jim yes we are we are modestly liability sensitive that liability sensitivity has increased slightly from the last quarter i do think of this as largely interest neutral but the liability sensitivity is growing just a little bit which i think is a great position to be in at this point of the cycle obviously the rate cuts comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 that occur according to the curve in will be more back ended so while it is a little bit of a lift for the projection its not a huge lift its really going to be more of a play we did assume the june curve in the outlook though frankly if we had updated that curve after the cpr report came out it really wouldnt have moved the overall outlook materially and again thats because so many of these cuts are occurring late in the year regarding the maturing swaps and securities and we do have a slide in the appendix on slide that outlines the maturing swaps and securities i have talked in the past about the fact that we expect to get about million uplift from those maturities in now thats a very simple calculation assuming rates were to stay constant if rates were to move number one it depends when rates move we may take some of that benefit in so obviously that will reduce the lift in but in an absolute sense youd still be getting it and at all that million also assumes these maturities and rate movements occur in a vacuum and as we know nothing occurs in a vacuum if rates do move down other parts of the balance sheet are going to be impacted including all the swaps and the swaps that are currently on the books that are not maturing they would certainly benefit so you have this million of maturing swaps and securities in a vacuum but all these other factors get rolled into what amounts to our modest liability sensitivity and i would just say that if the balance sheet and rates perform as expected we would probably get a little less than million for those maturing swaps and securities but you would likely make that up with our modest liability sensitivity so you really get it one way or the other assuming the balance sheet responds as we model it but of course well wait and see how things actually play out but i think big picture we feel pretty good about that number bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then just maybe following up on the noninterestbearing deposits i think it was mentioned obviously there is continued typical pressure but the narrative changed maybe a bit recently and just wanted to get your sense on would you expect like outflows to continue would be migration would you potentially be slowing once you know three four cuts kind of occur because obviously the rate differential is high and even if we get three four cuts it still remains relatively higher than it has been over the past several years so just want to get some thoughts on how you think that that could migrate james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc sure bernard we have been saying that as long as rates stay higher for longer we do expect to see some modest pressure on noninterestbearing deposits i think thats natural with rates being at this level ill reinforce that we are at the apex of the cycle at this point so this is probably where you are were seeing this maximum pressure and its a little uncomfortable but we do expect it to turn as rates move downwards in the latter part of the year in terms of the overall outlook you see that our average deposits in  were about billion we do think  is likely be slightly more than billion lower than that so thats just slightly below where we ended up on june and we think thats the low point we do see noninterestbearing deposits for both seasonal reasons as well as rates moving down we actually see a slight increase then in  and we would expect to see those continue to increase as we move through so we absolutely seem to be at the apex of the cycle with maximum pressure on noninterestbearing deposits but we do see that turning later this year comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thanks for taking my questions curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks bernard james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thank you operator thank you next question today is coming from mike mayo from wells fargo your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi so you said you have industryleading noninterestbearing deposits to a total of i think thats about double peer average but that might be going lower just remind us why is that so far ahead of peer and whats in the range whats been the low point of that over the last two decades and whats been the high point and where do you think that settles out james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc good morning mike its jim yeah we are very proud of that ratio i would point to the fact that we have been very focused really for the last decadeplus on payments and treasury management services and we believe that is a huge driver and something that really differentiates us i would put that as the largest factor certainly our commercial orientation helps a little bit because we have noninterestbearing deposits but of course we do offer a bit of an eca or ecr on that which is somewhat of a pseudointerest rate but its really part of our business model we absolutely emphasize noninterestbearing deposits when we extend credit we expect to get the deposit we expect to get the treasury management services and those noninterestbearing deposits tend to accompany those services now where weve been in the past yeah weve been much lower than that in the past before some of the treasury management initiatives had ramped up i would also say that in the past we had a very high loanto deposit ratio if you go back to prefinancial crisis as many banks did throughout the industry and so as a result we were offering much higher interest rates which created a little bit more migration we dont think were going to lean on brokered deposits anywhere close to that as we did in the past we expect our loantodeposit ratio to stay maintained but i would say in essence its our business model and its what we emphasize as we go out and solicit new business comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just to follow up the competitive environment seems as tough as its ever been for regional banks with a lot more bank expanding nationally how do you see that competitive environment as it relates to the deposits and your deposit guide and your loan guide is this cyclical and how much of this might be structural and at what point would you consider buying other bank or combining with other banks given the change in these strategic environments thank you peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc mike this is peter and ill comment first and ill let curt maybe comment on the strategic part of it but i think from a competitive standpoint we actually feel thats where the diversity of our model is just terribly compelling a number of regional banks are expanding nationally weve been national for a long time weve been in california for a long time in texas michigan were expanding in the southeast but i think our national presence has been very helpful when it comes to competitiveness on deposits so what youre trying to raise depositwise in michigan versus california versus texas gives us lots of options we also have a number of businesses that really are national businesses like our tls business our financial services division where were able to attract customers and deposits in different ways that dont necessarily tie us to lets say cd rates in the small part of texas for example weve got a lot of handles that were able to pull so i totally agree with you thats about as competitive as weve seen it in a long time not just on deposits really on loans and pricing and structure across the country right now its picked up a lot in the last quarter but i think that again the diversity of our model as weve tried to continue to communicate is just terribly compelling and gives us a lot of advantages in competing with regional banks community banks and the larger banks and so curt i might flip to you for curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah mike thank you for that question and on the strategic side we have been a very patient acquirer where we have done one acquisition in the last years have continued to lean into our organic growth model and the last couple of years weve seen nice growth on the asset side from the lending perspective and just expansion of our customer base and we think we continue to have really good opportunities to grow in all the markets that we operate in as well as the markets that weve expanded into more recently well have to wait and see how the environment unfolds thus far its been an environment with not a lot of ma occurring because of a lot of uncertainty around regulation and economy et cetera but certainly its something made strategic cultural sense for us and with a good fit we would take a look at it in one of our primary geographies but again that would not be our primary focus our primary focus continues to be on organic growth and we think we have really good opportunities there mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thank you mike curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks mike operator thank you next question today is coming from manan gosalia from morgan stanley your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc manan good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning apologies if i missed this in your prior remarks but can you comment on your conversations with customers on when loan demand can really start to come back right so i think pipelines are pretty robust but across the industry loan demand has been weak is it low rates that are going to bring back that demand is it some of the uncertainty with the elections et cetera going away can you just talk about what your conversations with customers have been peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah manan its peter i guess the answer to your question is probably a little bit of all the above i think in our surveys with customers we get the sense that the number one driver of loan demand impact right now is interest rates and we believe that to the extent that we start to see some reduction in rates that would impact loan demand or lead to hopefully some more loan demand and then i would acknowledge and i believe that when you talk to customers theres just sort of a id call it a wait and see a little bit as to what how the year is going to unfold when it comes to as curt said the regulatory environment get through the elections and i just i feel like historically thats a theme ive heard during presidential election years for a long time that most of your owner managed businesses kind of want to wait and see what things are going to look like after november and then they start to make decisions so to your point and i know a number of banks have been talking about this we feel like weve got a good outlook for the second half of the year were still showing positive point to point loan growth for overall but i think probably real demand doesnt pick up until you start to see interest rates come down and we get through the election manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and maybe on the credit side i know nothing notable to call out this quarter criticized assets moved lower but you know that the investor conversation has pivoted to some concerns around credit on the ci side as opposed to cre anything specific youre seeing there anything youre hearing from borrowers and i think if as growth starts to slow in the economy how do you think that impacts the credit of the portfolio overall comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc manan its melinda yeah obviously we posted a pretty nice quarter and honestly in the ci book was really where we saw the improvement it was pretty broadbased across a number of different industries that are sort of embedded in core middle market so at this point im not seeing were not seeing any trends in any one particular segment now having said that customers that are exposed to the consumer so b2c type companies service type companies are a little bit more challenged and probably going to are a little bit slower to show some improvement if theyre in that nonpass category but we feel really good about ci and quite frankly they have navigated this high rate environment by quite frankly managing cash flow really tightly honestly utilization is low so thats probably where some of the deposits have gone quite frankly because they want to utilize cash in the most efficient way and that is to pay down high cost debt so i feel pretty good about the ci portfolio that does not mean that were not going to continue to see some manageable level of migration and there could be some idiosyncratic event that impacts a particular customer commercial real estate obviously in a lot of focus but our portfolio continues to perform quite well it was very stable this quarter we continue to experience no delinquencies and no losses in our senior housing portfolio which was stressed because of rates but also just the environment for housing coming out of covid is very elevated from a nonpass credit perspective but is very stable at this point so im not seeing any major cracks filled as long as the economy continues to sort of chug along at that soft landing strategy i think well be okay and were well reserved if there is any issues that arise manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you manan operator thank you our next question today is coming from samuel varga from ubs your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning sam samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc good morning i just wanted to go back to the loan demand and loan growth commentary a little bit so im trying to square what you said about how november is sort of the key catalyst here and at the same time ph obviously the guide sort of assumes that the second half there is a rampup in loan demand so could you just help us understand i guess how much of the expected sort of demand pull through is or is there something in the pipelines that you already see that makes you comfortable that we could see something happen in the third quarter as well comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah sam i think i would still say though that probably the number one factor is interest rates and i think that november would be the secondary factor to that and i guess i would just say that as we see our pipelines as we sit right now thats kind of where were coming up with this point to point loan growth we had a great quarter of billion and point to point loan growth and so what we see for the rest of the year is that that should be able to continue and were encouraged by what we see and i would tell you its pretty broadbased across our businesses that growth last year we had a number of businesses that we were sort of rationalizing if you will getting through everything that occurred in and much of that is now picking back up and i think that as we get into the second half of the year the realization of that pipeline growth will start to be there but i dont think its going to really really pick up as i said until we do start to see some interest rates come down so as we sit right now ph our managers forecast we feel really good about how the second half of the year looks on the outlook that were showing samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks for that color and just my followup is around the noninterestbearing deposits and maybe a bit more looking into i just wanted to get a better sense for what would need to happen in your mind to actually see meaningful dollar balances move into the bank im trying to get a better sense for that is it just simply rate cuts or are there some increased leverage components that we would need to see before the dollars flow back into these accounts james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc hi good morning sam its jim of course were not offering any specific guidance at this time but i would say its really a function of three things one the rate environment we typically do see noninterestbearing deposits grow all things equal as rates start to come down so thats certainly a factor business activity again going back to answering mike mayos question noninterestbearing deposits are certainly a point of emphasis for us and then just overall economic growth as gdp grows nominally and it does look like were going to have some decent nominal growth in you typically expect money supply working capital levels within middle market businesses to grow proportionately with that so we do think a number of factors are pointing the right direction for noninterestbearing deposits to start growing again inflect later this year and then start growing in so we feel like again were going right now were somewhat in the apex of that cycle but we see some real strong tailwinds for us and any really commercial bank as we move through samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc understood thanks for taking my questions i appreciate it curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive
