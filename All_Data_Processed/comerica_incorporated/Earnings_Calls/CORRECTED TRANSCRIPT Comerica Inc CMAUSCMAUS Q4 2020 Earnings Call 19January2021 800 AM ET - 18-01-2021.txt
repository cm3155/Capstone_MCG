curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call as we all know was a very trying year and i could not be more proud of the unwavering commitment of our team to serve our customers communities and each other during this unprecedented time it has been truly remarkable when i assumed the role of chairman in january the fundamentals of the economy were strong and i was looking forward to working with our executive team to execute our relationship banking strategy then in march our focus shifted due to covid despite the many challenges the pandemic posed we have proven our resilience and achieved many important accomplishments along the way this includes the bank and the comerica charitable foundation together providing million of assistance to local communities and businesses we funded billion in ppp loans to small and mediumsized companies we were able to quickly enable the majority of our employees to work remotely and introduce programs to provide support such as promise pay and dependent care stipends as consumers desire to utilize digital channels increased we enhanced our online capabilities for deposit accounts as well as loan originations also we achieved our environmental goals set in to meaningfully reduce our water waste paper and ghg emissions our commitment to corporate responsibility was recognized including receiving high marks from newsweek diversityinc civic cdp and corporate comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 knights the compassion and tireless efforts of our colleagues across the bank has allowed comerica to persevere and remain in a strong position as we move forward slide provides a review of our financial results which included solid loan performance and a record level of deposits this growth combined with prudent management of loan and deposit pricing and action we took to deploy excess liquidity helped offset the pressure of rates dropping to ultralow levels in light of the swift deterioration of the economy we significantly increased our credit reserve and took a large provision in the first quarter while we saw some negative credit migration through the year it has been manageable and our net chargeoffs for the year were basis points or basis points excluding energy a true testament to our relationship banking strategy and deep credit experience card fees and securities trading income were strong while other fees such as deposit service charges and commercial lending fees were impacted by the slowdown in economic activity expenses remained wellcontrolled and included covidrelated costs we maintained our strong capital levels and our book value grew to over per share in summary a solid performance particularly considering the difficult environment our fourth quarter performance is outlined on slide we generated earnings of million or per share a increase over the third quarter driven by an increase in revenue and strong credit quality compared to the third quarter loans essentially performed as we expected while lower on a quarteroverquarter basis average loans increased in december ph rather to november by nearly million excluding ppp loan repayments our loan pipeline continued to grow through the year to precovid levels at yearend average deposits increased by nearly billion to an alltime high with of the growth derived from noninterestbearing accounts customers continue to prudently manage their cash cutting costs and reducing leverage yet they remain cautiously optimistic that the economy will pick up in the back half of this year net interest income increased million benefiting from our continued careful management of loan and deposit pricing combined with the contribution from fees related to ppp loan forgiveness this was partly offset by lower loan balances in addition lower yields on our securities portfolio were mostly offset by actions we took in the third quarter to deploy a portion of excess liquidity by increasing the size of the portfolio as far as credit our metrics remain strong and our provision was a credit of million criticized loans declined and net chargeoffs were only basis points positive portfolio migration and a slight improvement in the economic forecasts resulted in a reduction of the credit reserve to just under billion or nearly times nonperforming assets through the cycles our credit performance relative to the industry has been a key differentiator and i believe we will continue to outperform noninterest income increased million or as customer activity continued to rebound this included strong derivative income and commercial lending fees we continue to maintain our expense discipline as we invest for the future while expenses were higher in the fourth quarter this was primarily driven by performance incentives as well as outside process related to our card platform our capital levels remain strong our cet1 ratio increased to above our target of as always our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive return to our shareholders and now i will turn the call over to jim james j herzog executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide average loans decreased approximately million or which compared favorably to the industry h8 data loans in corporate banking and general middle market decreased as customers are performing well prudently managing their business to increase cash flow and reduce debt for the fourth consecutive quarter energy loans decreased and are at the lowest level since the us rig count is less than half of what it was a year ago however it has been gradually increasing since late summer as oil prices began to recover technology and life sciences loans declined about million mainly due to ma and increased liquidity driven by fundraising activity and companies reducing cash burn equity fund services which provides capital call lines to investment companies increased million as activity has picked up with new fund formation national dealer increased million as inventory levels are slowly rebuilding yet remains billion below fourth quarter mortgage banker reached a new record with strong activity in both refi and home sales periodend loans were stable and included a decline in ppp balances of million primarily due to loan forgiveness line utilization at yearend for the total portfolio remained relatively low at loan yields increased basis points with accelerated fees from ppp forgiveness and continued pricing actions particularly adding libor floors when possible as loans renew average deposits increased or billion to a new record of billion as shown on slide the largest driver continues to be noninterestbearing deposits and growth has been broadbased with increases in nearly every business line customers continue to conserve and maintain excess cash balances periodend deposits increased over billion timing of monthly benefit activity in our government prepaid card business increased balances by billion at quarterend however this does not include the latest stimulus payments which were received in early january with strong deposit growth our loantodeposit ratio decreased to the average cost of interestbearing deposits reached an alltime low of basis points a decrease of basis points from the third quarter and our total funding costs fell to only basis points as you can see on slide the average balance of the securities portfolio increased this was due to the third quarter purchase of billion in additional securities primarily treasuries as we took some action to put some of our excess liquidity to work the additional securities combined with lower rates on the replacement of prepays which totaled about billion resulted in the yield on the portfolio declining to we expect repayments of mbs to continue to be about billion per quarter and yields on reinvestments to be in the lowtomid basis point range turning to slide net interest income increased million to million and the net interest margin was up basis points to interest income on loans increased million adding basis points to the margin higher fees mostly related to ppp loan forgiveness and continue pricing actions as loans renew together added million and basis points to the margin other portfolio dynamics including higher nonaccrual income added million the decrease in loans had a million unfavorable impact lower securities yields had a million or basis point negative impact this was mostly offset by the higher balance which added million average balances of the fed increased over million impacting the margin by basis point our extraordinarily high fed balances of billion continue to weigh heavily on the margin with a gross impact of approximately basis points finally prudent management and deposit pricing added million and basis points to the margin and lower rates on wholesale funding added million given the nature of our portfolio our loans repriced very quickly as comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 rates dropped earlier last year so the bulk of the impact from lower rates has been absorbed also while deposit rates are at record lows we continue to manage deposit pricing with a closed eye on the competitive environment and our liquidity position overall credit quality was strong as shown on slide gross chargeoffs were only million a decrease of million from the third quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points nonperforming assets increased million yet remain below our historical norm at basis points of total loans inflows to nonaccrual were about half of the amount of the third quarter and the lowest level of any quarter since the pandemic began criticized loans declined million and comprised of the total portfolio we believe our disciplined underwriting and diverse portfolio are assisting us in managing through the pandemic conditions positive migration in the portfolio combined with a modestly improved economic outlook resulted in a small decrease in our allowance for credit losses as the path to full economic recovery remains uncertain due to the unprecedented challenges of the covid19 pandemic our reserve ratio remains elevated at or excluding ppp loans were wellpositioned with a relatively high credit reserve and overall improving credit quality slide provides detail on segments that we believe pose higher risk in the current environment periodend loans in the social distancing segment declined slightly criticized loans were stable and nonaccruals remain under this segment has performed better than expected but issues can be lumpy and sudden and resulted in net chargeoffs of million in the fourth quarter the new round of ppp will certainly be helpful for customers that are challenged by the current environment energy loans decreased to billion at quarter end representing of our total loans oil prices have increased and credit quality has improved with reductions in criticized nonaccruals and net chargeoffs we have seen a little more capital markets activity and fall redeterminations resulted in only a slight decrease in borrowing bases due to lower reserves additional information can be found in the appendix while were pleased with the performance of these segments we have applied a more severe economic forecast to them and believe we are well reserved noninterest income increased million as outlined on slide continuing the positive trend weve seen since post the shutdown of the economy earlier last year fourth quarter includes increased customer activity in most categories customer derivative income increased million with higher volume due to interest rate swaps and energy hedges combined with a change in the impact from the credit valuation adjustment specifically there is an unfavorable adjustment of million in the third quarter and a favorable adjustment of less than million in the fourth quarter commercial lending fees increased million with the seasonal pickup in syndication activity and higher unutilized line fees we had smaller increases in fiduciary foreign exchange and letters of credit also card fees remained very strong due to government card and merchant activity spurred by the economic stimulus and changes in customer behavior related to the covid environment securities trading income which includes fair market adjustments for investments we hold related to our technology and life sciences business decreased million from elevated levels generated over the last couple quarters note deferred comp asset returns were million a million increase from the third quarter and are offsetting noninterest expenses all in all a strong quarter for fee income comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 turning to expenses on slide salaries and benefits increased million with higher performancebased incentives severance staff insurance expense and technologyrelated labor note that on a fullyear basis salary and benefit expense was stable with a reduction in incentive compensation offsetting annual merit higher deferred comp and covidrelated costs we realized a billion increase in outside processing due to card activity technology spend as well as ppp program costs occupancy increased million due to a catch up in maintenance projects that were delayed due to covid as well as seasonal expenses there is also a seasonal increase in advertising expense our strong expense discipline is well ingrained and is assisting us in navigating the slow rate environment as we invest for the future our capital levels remain strong as shown on slide our cet1 ratio increased to an estimated of our target of as always our priority is to use our capital to support our customers drive growth while providing an attractive return to our shareholders in this regard weve maintained a very competitive dividend yield as far as share repurchases we have a long track record of actively managing our capital and returning excess capital generated to shareholders as we sit here today a great deal of uncertainty remains about the ultimate pace of the economic recovery whether it be faster or slower than economists forecasts for that reason we have paused for share repurchases and look forward to restarting the program as soon as we deem it prudent to do so slide provides our outlook for the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter as well as some color on the year ahead in the first quarter we expect national dealer loans to continue to increase at a moderate pace as auto inventory rebuilds also middle market is expected to grow as a result of increased economic activity however this will be more than offset by mortgage banker declining from its record high due to seasonally lower purchase and refi volumes energy is expected to decrease due to higher oil prices driving improved cash flow and capital markets activity as far as ppp loans we expect the pace of loan forgiveness could potentially exceed the second round of fundings looking past the first quarter excluding ppp loan activity and based on improving economic conditions we expect loans to grow throughout the year we expect average deposits to remain strong in the first quarter as customers continue to carefully manage their liquidity as far as net interest income continued management of loan and deposit pricing is expected to be accretive albeit to a lesser degree than weve seen so far we are currently in the process of deploying some excess liquidity by repaying billion of fhlb advances over an eightweek period which will provide a modest lift these benefits are expected to be more than offset by reduced loan balances lower yields and securities slightly lower libor as well as two fewer days in the quarter as we move through the year assuming theres no change from rates that we experienced in the fourth quarter we expect quarterly pressure on securities yields and swap maturities to be mostly offset by loan growth excluding ppp impacts we expect net chargeoffs to increase from low levels weve seen recently however with our credit reserve at yearend at over of loans excluding ppp we believe we are well positioned to manage through this period of economic uncertainty we expect noninterest income in the first quarter to benefit from higher deposit service charges fiduciary and brokerage fees as deferred comp is difficult to predict we assume it will not be repeated we expect a seasonal decline in syndication activity also card warrants and securities trading income are expected to decline from elevated levels as we progressed through the year we believe that customerdriven fee categories in general should grow with improving economic conditions we expect expenses to be lower in the first quarter our pension expense is comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 expected to decline million in the first quarter to get to the new run rate for the decline is primarily due to strong investment performance in as i mentioned we do not forecast deferred comp of million to repeat also marketing and occupancy expenses are expected to be seasonally lower and there are two less days in the quarter partly offsetting all of this first quarter includes annual stock comp and associated higher payroll taxes we remain focused on maintaining our expense discipline while we invest in the future therefore on a fullyear basis we expect higher salary expense related to normal merit and incentive comp as well as higher tax spend will be mostly offset by lower pension and deferred comp returns we expect a tax rate excluding discrete items finally as mentioned in the previous slide we remain focused on maintaining our strong capital levels and providing an attractive return to the shareholders now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim while difficult and uncertain conditions persist i am confident that our team will continue to adapt and thrive as we have over the past year we expect the economy will improve in we believe firming trade and manufacturing conditions increasing business and consumer confidence as well as pentup demand will support solid economic growth particularly in the back half of the year comerica has a long history of successfully managing through challenging times we have demonstrated our resiliency and unwavering dedication to provide a high level of customer service as we navigate the covid pandemic we maintain a culture that drives continuous efficiency improvement we believe this will assist us in preserving our cost base as the economy improves and we continue to invest in our future our disciplined credit culture and strong capital base continues to serve us well utilizing our deep expertise and experience to help our customers navigate these difficult times builds and solidifies longterm relationships these key strengths provide the foundation to continue to deliver a longterm shareholder value this has been demonstrated by our roe which increased over in the fourth quarter and our book value per share which grew over the past year as well as the current dividend yield which remains above thank you for your time and now wed be happy to take your questions comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning everyone maybe start with the outlook for loans i believe you said about million of loan growth you experienced or saw in december how much of that was within general middle market and im just trying to get behind some of your optimism about growth in that portfolio at least in the early part and throughout peter sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc hey terry its peter thanks for the question yeah the month of december was felt really good it actually felt like kind of precovid environment i dont know that i would say that it was robust per se though in general middle market or our general business banking businesses those businesses continue to do really well but we saw a little more of our momentum i think in some of our specialty businesses than just pure middle market now that said i do feel good about sort of where the pipeline is going into the year were encouraged by what we are seeing in that segment and hopefully the first quarter will be a little bit better than what weve been seeing in this covid world so again i think that most of our general businesses are still have this headwind of a that youre seeing with covid across the country making it a little challenging terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and then as a follow up i just saw that the severance expenses on slide were ph at least higher in the fourth quarter could you just talk is there internally a plan to maybe reduce the head count and focus on expenses and i know you talked about the first quarter expense trends any thoughts on fullyear core expense growth kind of netting out some of the moving parts that we see quartertoquarter thank you james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah terry this is jim thanks for the question regarding the severance that we had in the fourth quarter i would say that that was specifically targeted in certain areas just to restructure and make sure that we had the right staffing both to fit the skillsets that we need in certain areas and also its part of some of the transition weve had with new leaders so its really more optimizing our org structure as opposed to an expense reduction play regarding just core expenses going forward ill just say that we clearly had some expenses in the fourth quarter that elevated our run rate and i certainly would not look at the fourth quarter as an example of what the run rate will be going forward as we look into the full year for as we mentioned in the opening remarks i do expect that lower pension expense and deferred comp will mostly offset merit tax spend and a little bit of a reset of stock comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 comp given the covid year that we had this year so wed expect expenses just to be slightly up on a yearto year basis terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks everyone curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc morning ken kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great good morning everyone question in terms of provision guidance so obviously i see its reflective of the economy but i guess my two questions on this what does your economic model expect to happen that youre building in for your provision and if that does play out as you expect how do you see provision expense trending going forward melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc hey ken this is melinda thanks for the question i mean obviously the small reserve release that we had this quarter was really reflective of the really strong credit performance of the portfolio and modestly continuing to improve economic forecast we use a variety of forecast in the cecl provisioning process that go through different scenarios including recovery as well as some additional stress in the more stressed scenarios assuming no material change to the credit profile which based on all the factors that we see today were not expecting any material credit deterioration and that the macro economic outlook stays stable to slightly continuing to improve as we go throughout and probably most importantly that the current level of uncertainty has started to abate ie we get past the next couple of months of this covid resurgence the vaccine rollout accelerates and the efficacy is proven out reserve levels are definitely going to come down its impossible to tell you exactly how thats going to play out as you know cecl is a very complex accounting exercise that we go through each quarter but we expect to be moving towards precovid levels over the course of and perhaps into the early part of kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right no thats very helpful and then just a followup question in terms of the accelerated ppp fees can you just clarify again how are you accounting for the anticipated accelerated fees in your nii guidance comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah ken we exclude ppp from that guidance since it is unpredictable in terms of where it would go when i look at ppp we noted that we had pretty strong fees in the fourth quarter the majority of which that increase was ppp i would expect in the first quarter that amount of accelerated fees to about double from the increase that we saw in the fourth quarter and i wouldnt necessarily expect overall ppp income to double in first quarter compared to fourth just because the rate of loan forgiveness will probably exceed the new round two thats coming on board kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got you okay so when you said and i think if i heard this correctly for the full year for nii i think you were assuming the lower security yields largely offset by loan growth so we assume relatively stable nii ph then any accelerated ppp fees would be on top of that so itd be technically going from flat to something positive on nii side is that the right way of thinking about it james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc that is the right way of thinking about it itll clearly be higher in because of accelerated ppp fees but i was excluding that for the guidance kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it perfect all right very clear thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning i wonder if i could just hop over to your commentary on buybacks i know you indicated that you plan to remain on the sidelines right now pending some clarity around the macro backdrop but can you give us a little bit more detail there like what exactly are you looking for in terms of data points on the macro backdrop to get you comfortable that you can start to put some of the excess capital to work thanks james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc all right john thanks this is jim when you look at where were at today were actually at the peak of the covid pandemic i think we just had a record in terms of daily deaths in the last week or so and so we just think its prudent to wait and look for a little more clear line of sight in terms of where this thing is going we feel like we already returned a fair amount of capital just due to the relatively stronger dividend we have compared to peers we are just looking forward to starting the share buyback comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 but we just think its prudent to wait to see where things go because we want to make sure were there for the customers should things either take off faster than expected or what were more focused on is what would happen if the economy took a step backwards we needed to be there for our customers and there were some economic ramifications to the step down and so were just being careful in watching for a clear line of sight and well look forward to starting it at the appropriate time john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thank you and then separately on the margin front i know you dont really give explicit margin guidance but just want to get your thoughts on some of the maybe if you can help us in how to think about the nim progression from here given the ppp benefit but also youve got the steeper curve which is certainly a factor but also the expectation and short rates remain low so i just wanted to see if you can help us with that and then secondarily if you can maybe give us some color on your new money loan yields by portfolio if you have that thanks james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah we can answer that in a couple of different ways i mean number one the ppp income will be a little bit lumpy by quarter so as i mentioned earlier we will exclude that from the guidance overall we will have more ppp income in certainly than we did in and as we mentioned during the script i do expect the impact from rates even though the yield curve has steepened as you point out were still adding securities in that low 100bp range and so we are adding securities at a lower rate than what we are running off and then on top of that youll notice in the appendix we are going to have in the second half of the year some lumpy treasury maturities as well as some hedges that start to mature not in a big way but due to all those factors we will see a little bit of rate pressure each quarter and i do see that mostly offsetting or perhaps a little more than offsetting the loan growth benefit that we get now ppp would be totally separate from that and again we will see some significant amounts of accelerated fee income as the year goes on both due to round one as well as round two so hopefully that helps make it a little bit more clear curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc peter do you want to comment just about maybe what youre seeing in the competitive landscape on the lending side peter sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc yeah sure john john pancari q analyst evercore isi yes comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 peter sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc go ahead john john pancari q analyst evercore isi yeah no i was just asking about the new money loan yields if you happen to have that by the different types of the different loan categories thanks james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc john as you see from the slide weve actually been having some pretty good success with our loan yields and the pricing of new business coming on board we actually did have a slightly lower libor in the quarter about bps down youll notice that due to pricing actions we showed an increase of million just due to pricing dynamics overcoming that lower libor so you could take away from that that loan yields were holding up quite well in fact theyre accretive right now now we dont expect that to continue at that same rate as i mentioned because there are competitive pressures and there is a lot of excess liquidity out there but up until now theyve been holding up quite well peter sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc yeah john its peter i would just add i mean pricing continues to be very competitive out there in the marketplace depending on which line of business you might be talking about its maybe more opportunity for us than others it just sort of depends but to jims point i think weve done a really good job of maintaining our pricing and producing good yields for the bank and so so far weve been able to keep doing that and i think well be able to do it going forward john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc good morning so i wanted to ask if assuming that rates stay low at the short end and we get a bit more steepening could you give a little bit more color on when you would expect the trajectory of net interest income to stop declining and then i guess within the securities portfolio if you could discuss what kind of reinvestment rates youre seeing relative to the and maybe a little bit more color on what opportunity a steeper curve represents that would be great comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah bill its jim thanks for the question its really the short rates that drive our net interest income here at comerica and so even with a little bit more steepening in the yield curve we are still going to have some pressure on the securities line in fact the you mentioned right now were adding securities in the low ones and so it would say quite a bit of steep things to head off that deterioration that were seeing and in addition we are seeing some lumpy maturities with treasuries that you see again in the appendix as well as swaps and that has quite a delta between what wed either reinvest those in ph or if they just fill the cash at the fed so it really would take a change in shortterm rates to see any kind of material movement upward in their ongoing net interest income on a quartertoquarter basis bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats very helpful and i had a followup on expenses and efficiency more broadly if i could can we see a return to positive operating leverage without higher rates given the dynamics that you were just describing on net interest income curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc bill this is curt i might just talk a little bit about our sort of incomegenerating potential and just sort of our outlook from a growth perspective going forward and your question was specifically about efficiency ratio but i might first just comment that the last two quarters we were able to generate doubledigit roe in what has been a pretty challenging environment and we continue to feel really good about our longterm financial model and really our longterm financial outlook and our business model and as always were focused on the things that we can control we think weve got a very attractive franchise were in a lot of very high growth markets that we do believe should perform better than the us as a whole as we come out of the covid situation and hit the second half of the year so we do believe that well see a higher customer demand loan activity et cetera and as you know weve got a lot of depth and expertise in middle market business banking a number of sort of unique businesses and beyond just sort of the balance sheet growth opportunity we continue to maintain a very attractive deposit base and most financial institutions are flush with deposits right now but we really feel like what weve got is very relationshiporiented deposits and weve done a very good job of relationship pricing with those deposits credit continues to do very well we think we will outperform relative to our peer group in that area in which we think were newer to our overall financial performance and then were very focused on two other things i would mention is just fee income and how we can generate more fee income as an institution especially in the card area treasury management wealth management weve got strong capabilities there weve been doing a lot to continue to invest in those areas and we again think that will help in terms of our overall financial performance and our expenses were up some for the quarter we do feel like thats not necessarily run rate but just some unique items that hit us in the fourth quarter and our expense discipline is very ingrained in our culture and were always looking for opportunities to continue to manage tightly on the expense front comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 and then just maybe lastly as i said in my formal comments weve made it through lots of different cycles and this is just another cycle that were managing through and as an institution we have always struck a good balance between growth and conservative management of our balance sheet and in credit and we think that will help us manage through whatever happens in the next three or four months but position us well longer term given all of the factors that i just outlined bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you all for taking my questions curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jennifer demba with truist securities curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc good morning could you give us a little more detail on what youre seeing in the more atrisk portfolios from more social distancing right now the credit obviously continues to outperform peers so just curious as to what youre seeing below the surface here melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc hey jennifer this is melinda thanks for the question so overall as youve already sort of highlighted and jim and curt did in their opening comments i mean were really pleased with the performance of the portfolio as a whole and although these are atrisk industries they have actually held up i think better than what we would have expected coming into this the segment called social distancing specifically are those companies that are most directly impacted by any social mitigation actions that are taking place so obviously in the near term given the current coronavirus surging its probably the portfolio that we are watching the closest and probably has the most opportunity for some additional migration all of these four portfolios that are listed on slide although they have elevated credit metrics we have not seen a high level of migration into the npa category which obviously npas would need to increase in order to see significantly increasing losses the energy portfolio although it has the most stressed credit metrics actually has stabilized quite nicely and certainly prices at a barrel supplydemand dynamics have changed and that portfolio i would call much more stabilized even though it has elevated credit metrics and certainly chargeoffs the last two quarters have shown that we may be through the worst of that that can change really quickly with energy obviously given the commodity nature so we are continuing to work with those borrowers comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 so overall again we feel pretty good about all these atrisk industries we certainly are well reserved with almost billion of reserves and feel like anything that does migrate into that npa category we are more than well reserved to handle jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks so much curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jennifer operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning everyone melinda question for you a followup to kens earlier question on the outlook for reserve levels i know you probably hate these questions but when we think about precovid reserve levels and i look at slide and i see that reserve and i think the day one cecl for you if i remember correctly was basically zero that may be a positive is that the message youre sending when you say precovid levels that we can head back to those levels by the end of or early is that what you said or did i miss hear that melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc no i think thats fair and accurate i mean again obviously cecl is a complex accounting exercise and every single quarter were going to take the most recent economic forecast in the portfolio our portfolio and whats happening in our portfolio but again given where the credit metrics are today and the overall improving economic forecast particularly for the second half of the year i think that directionally yes we expect to be headed in the direction of precovid levels i cant tell you what that number is i dont think anybody knows what that number is i mean were in new and uncharted territory cecl obviously is new and weve never sort of come out of a recessionary environment particularly one as severe as what we experienced in the first and second quarter but directionally yes by the end of beginning of and that could either slow or accelerate based on how quickly the second half of the year recovery happens jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thats all fair and then on the chargeoffs thinking youre saying modest increase and i guess is there anything we should be aware of i mean are there any bigger chargeoffs coming or bigger problems that youre worried about or you just expect maybe some modest increases which i think we probably all have built into the models but is there anything you want to flag for us in terms of the longerterm chargeoff outlook comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc no i think what you said that its really just the modest increases over the particularly low levels that weve seen in the last couple of quarters weve obviously also had some nice recoveries those are lumpy and difficult to predict so there is nothing in the portfolio that has me overly concerned from a concentration perspective i mean i think that where well continue to see chargeoffs honestly is going to be in those atrisk portfolios and probably more likely in that social distancing jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay then if i can squeeze in one more maybe for peter the dealer balances and the trends how long do you think it takes to get back to normal and do you think normal is that kind of high billion type balance range thanks peter sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc yeah jon thanks i dont know if normal is the billion i think getting back to normal is probably harder to determine than we would like its certainly second half of hopefully its just hopefully seeing that business kind of get back to its normal inventory levels which theres a lot of debate about when or if thats going to happen we believe it will happen and we hear from our customers they believe that that will happen as well so hopefully that that happens in the second part of this year and we certainly we love that space were very comfortable getting back to the numbers you see in prior quarters on slide and if that can happen into this year and into next then wed be very excited about that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it thank you operator our next question will come from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steven melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 so curt my first question during this period of low rates and slow growth weve seen more banks turning to ma right to drive shareholder value and its been quite a while since weve seen comerica use this tool as you think about priorities how are you viewing ma here and should we expect to see the company get more active on this front curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc well steven as i have said through the years on these calls and other forums as well we believe our model really is built for success on organic growth were in great lines of business where we have deep expertise and scale and in great markets where we still have a lot of room to continue to grow and so were going to be primarily focused on that i do think theres a lot of uncertainty around the environment on a goforward basis and how the credit cycle will play out and so i dont have a crystal ball as to what ma activity looks like in but really no change for us focused on organic growth and weve only done two deals in the last years we have said repeatedly that if we were going to look at opportunities we are probably first and foremost interested in texas and california given the growth dynamics of both of those markets and that a deal would have to make great sort of strategic and cultural sense for us and so while thereve been a number of deals announced last year that really doesnt change our overall view and were going to be a patient acquirer it doesnt mean that we wouldnt look at opportunities but again first and foremost focused on organic growth we would as we have been in the past be interested in things that are nonbank acquisitions so if we have a gap in fee income or we see an opportunity there then those are the types of things we might look at as well nothing on the immediate horizon steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and for my followup if i could ask you a big picture question so one of the impacts that weve talked about has been from the pandemic is this dramatic acceleration right the adoption of digital consumers businesses everybody curt how has this impacted how you view the historical relationship banking model at the company and how have your investments in technology changed as youre seeing customers adapt digital more frequently thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc well fortunately i think not only for us steve but for the whole industry weve all been on this digital journey and in many regards and the covid situation has accelerated that path as weve seen more migration to digital and mobile online channels for consumers as well as businesses we believe that we remain in a well well positioned there weve got a really strong talent on the it side and this past year we recruited a new executive director of technology operations megan crespi and a new cio bruce mitchell and theyve been bringing a lot of new thoughts and ideas to us and its always for us sort of focused on two areas one is the things that we can do to continue to enable our customers and provide attractive products and services for our customers and then secondly how we use technology to help reduce expenses across the company things like ai et cetera we talked before about the fact that weve been on this path of migration to the cloud and are making good progress there comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 and weve also talked about the fact that while we dont necessarily have the same scale as many of our larger competitors we can leverage both a good blend of proprietary capabilities with third parties and really achieve scale where needed if we dont necessarily have it inhouse and there are a number of things that weve got in flight right now we rolled out a new digital onboarding platform last year that will benefit really across all of our business lines in terms of originating new relationships via mobile and web channels weve rolled out a new loan origination platform for our consumer bank weve done a lot around just how we leverage data and push data to our employees in terms of customer information were making a number of enhancements to our treasury management platform and then weve been going through some upgrades in our wealth management business line and new trust platform and a new wealth management portal sort of single signon portal for our wealth management clients so i think we remain competitive we feel good about our positioning i think its always important to remember that we are first and foremost primarily a commercial bank and relationships still really matter in that business the intellectual capital we bring the advice we bring every deal we do is highly customized its not something that you push out over sort of a digital channel but weve got to have products and services that support the treasury side of the house the treasurer or the cfo et cetera in that space and we believe we do and then even in the other business lines wealth management and even in our retail bank we tend to serve a more affluent client relationship still really important there advice still really important but again enable through a digital and mobile and other channels as well and we feel like were wellpositioned steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay terrific thanks for all the color operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i know youve asked about loan growth and the confidence that it picks up in the second quarter and the reason i ask is weve heard from other banks that there was so much excess liquidity that borrowers would tap that excess liquidity before drawing down on lines of credit or new loan growth i just wonder if you could talk about that peter sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 yeah peter this is peter i think youll probably see both of those things i dont know that i would disagree with the idea that we probably see some of the liquidity you get used up i mean weve got very high deposits right now like all banks some of the highest weve seen and so i suspect that would be part of the turn and frankly a good indicator that loan direction is moving in that is moving up while deposits are coming down so regardless of which of those necessarily occurs first we still feel pretty encouraged that the second half of the year based on most of the macro indicators that were seeing so far would lead us to believe that were going to see a better second half of the year when it comes to loan growth but i dont think youre necessarily wrong or i wouldnt disagree with that idea that you would like to see deposits come down first and i think those together would directionally be really good for loans peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and jim if i could followup about the reinvestment pressure on the securities portfolio would you continue to shift some of that excess liquidity into securities as maybe as an offset like we saw in the fourth quarter james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah peter thanks for the question that is something that were going to have to examine on an ongoing basis we have been and we are taking incremental steps to invest the excess liquidity but were being careful not to jump in all at once and place a big bet at any one time given that we just dont know where things were headed so as you look at where weve been and where were going certainly starting in late second quarter of third quarter of we did prepay a material amount of purchase funds midway through third quarter and of course we bought the billion of securities which had a fourth quarter benefit also and then as i mentioned in the first quarter of this year were prepaying billion of fhlb funding so we are attempting to take steps that show some type of benefit each quarter in terms of doing something with the excess liquidity but we want to do it in a very measured way we dont necessarily want to sit on the sidelines forever but we dont want to jump in all at once either and so youll see us continue to evaluate as time goes on and take incremental steps as the quarters go on and then when theres more of a line of sight we may take even a bigger step but we do think caution is in order but totally sitting on the sidelines doesnt make sense either so the measured pace is kind of were managing ourselves to peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for taking my question curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you peter operator your next question comes from the line of gary tener with da davidson curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning gary comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning thanks my questions were just answered appreciate it curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you gary operator your next question will come from the line of brian foran with autonomous research curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning brian brian foran q analyst autonomous research good morning i just wanted to ask one guidance clarification and then one followup on your macro commentary so on the nii guidance youve referenced a lot of puts and takes you gave a lot of great detail and at one point it seemed like youre indicating relatively stable are you thinking more from the reported or more from like the annualized run rate ph for that now curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thats really looking brian at fourth quarter thats really our anchor point brian foran q analyst autonomous research got it curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc obviously youre going to just get some nuances with days in the quarter and so on but thats right where were at right now going forward brian foran q analyst autonomous research got it and then on the growth you gave a kind of commentary on loan growth so i dont want to answer a question thats redundant but it did really jump out to me that comment that december felt really good almost like precovid i wonder if you could just give the next level down was it the conversations with clients was it the pipelines or certain activity metrics youre looking at what were the things that started to feel like precovid by the time we got to end of december peter sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 hey brian its peter and the one i know for sure is just the amount of deals that we approved and looked at in the month of december that came through the process and so that was probably the best indicator that ive had that melinda and ive had together in a while of just what we see at our committees and the amount of activity weve had so that was encouraging now end of the year is always busy youre always going to sort of see that but it certainly felt like a precovid better than wed certainly seen in the last days and one thing i continue to say about the pipeline is that it feels and the numbers look good they look precovid what is less certain is just the timing of some of this and so much of it right now is ma its dividend recaps its not necessarily core requests that companies have for capex or things like that so its a little bit lumpy but it does feel better than it did certainly days ago its just still a little bit hard to determine when exactly all of thats going to happen so hopefully that gives you a little doubleclick down brian as to what you were looking for brian foran q analyst autonomous research that was great thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc hello scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everybody hey thank you for taking the question i think most of mine have been hit but i just wanted to ask one question just on the mortgage banker portfolio obviously its been kind of swollen by the huge mortgage market we had over the course of the past year or so just i guess im curious where that ends up settling out since theres so much error between where it started and where it is now i guess the both cases that you guys as sort of a strong market share player would retain more of those balances as originations for the industry kind of normalized but just curious how you guys see that playing out peter sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc yeah scott its peter thank you slide in the appendix has our mortgage banker outlook for originations in and i think weve usually used that as an indicator of what we think the year is going to be as jim indicated itll be a little bit of a headwind on loan balances but overall we think the sort of annual cycle you see in that business continues to lift for us if you will a little bit we continue to add new names we love the space weve been in it a long long time we think were a very important player in it comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 and so i think when you look at the outlook for the mba forecast that sort of gives you an idea of what i think were going to see but we also feel like we are increasing our customer count and our opportunities in that space and well continue to do so in the coming quarters and years r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right perfect thank you very much curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah operator your next question comes from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thank you good morning i just wanted to ask a followup to steves question regarding technology i think an ironic benefit of covid if you call it that is that it does allow kind of a reanalysis reexamination of the entire delivery structure you have seen banks some banks kind of attack their branch structure more aggressively to pay for or fund some of the tech investments is that a direction that you may potentially pursue in the future as your new tech team settles in curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc brock just a couple of comments around our branch network first of all just from a size standpoint we have roughly banking centers so we dont have the same sort of scale that some players have and we have less redundancy in markets so youre not going to drive down the street and see two comerica banking centers across the street from each other and so weve kind of eliminated any sort of redundancy in the platform and feel pretty good about the network we have overall having said that just like all financial services firms we have been selectively continuing to prune that portfolio weve been changing the configuration in the banking centers weve been leveraging technology more doing away with things like traditional teller lines having more sort of universal bankers in the banking center that can handle all things for clients whether its a loan or deposit need or whatever advisory type capabilities we need to deliver and thats allowed us to reduce head count in the banking centers over time and reduce the ftes and the banking centers and so i do think that that trend of just sort of continued slowly decreasing the size of the number of banking centers will continue but i dont think you should expect necessarily that were going to announce some huge restructuring of our banking center platform we have other ways i think to continue to fund our technology journey and weve been able to do that within our overall expense base comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and more broadly and i know this is difficult given the uncertainty of covid but on the back of that do you have any sense you can give us sort of how we should think about the efficiency the efficiency ratio and where that could potentially run james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc brock thats going to be dependent upon number one where the economy goes and where interest rates go that will be a big driver and i think were in a little bit of uncharted territory here but in the meanwhile we are focused on all those things that we can control i would echo curts comments in terms of some of the things were doing on the technology side we do focus on efficiencies on an ongoing basis and we do plan leveraging technology both in terms of the ia to make departments more efficient as well as the distribution systems whether that be in the commercial banking side with treasury management systems or the banking centers that you mentioned so well continue to take steps to refine how we approach distribution model and the overall expense base and the revenue will be somewhat driven over the next two or three years by the rate environment in the meanwhile we will keep doing all the good blocking and tackling that weve been doing historically and keep focusing on those things that we can control brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thank you appreciate the color operator and i will now turn the call back over to curt farmer president chairman and ceo for any closing remarks curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc we just said it as always we appreciate everyones interest in comerica we continue to hope for good health for all of you and better days ahead for our country in have a great day operator ladies and gentlemen that will conclude todays call
