healthy and coping well during this unprecedented time today we reported earnings of per share the highlight of the quarter was very strong loan and deposit growth which drove balances to record highs and partly offset the impact of lower interest rates on net interest income overall credit quality remained solid however with the unprecedented rapid decline in the economy and high level of uncertainty we again prudently increased our credit reserves capital levels continued to be strong and our book value per share grew to over we have quickly adapted to the covid19 pandemic and are continuing to make adjustments as the crisis evolves with over of our colleagues working from home the health and safety of our employees and customers remain our top priority for those who cannot work from home in our operations areas and banking indiscernible locations we are making precautions to minimize health risk and have provided enhanced covid19 related benefits across the bank our colleagues have continued to ensure that our customers are well taken care of consistent with our longstanding relationship banking focus comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 our team has worked diligently to support our customers providing sound financial advice credit expertise and payment flexibility where needed i am proud of the tremendous dedication our colleagues have displayed in supporting the paycheck protection program im extremely thankful for the unwavering commitment of our comerica team and i am honored to serve as ceo during these challenging times helping our customers and communities endure stressful situations and achieve longterm success is at the heart of comericas relationship banking strategy as weve previously announced we have significantly increased our financial commitment to serve our communities comerica together with comerica charitable foundation have pledged million to nonprofit organizations that care for and provide critical services to our communities this includes more than million to community development financial institutions and other business development nonprofits as well as a recent million commitment to the national business league to assist blackowned small businesses our loan growth in the second quarter further demonstrates the support we have provided our customers average loans increased billion with growth in the majority of our businesses including billion in ppp loans which provided needed liquidity to middle market and small business customers the strength of our customer relationships was also evidenced with broad based growth in average deposits of billion noninterestbearing deposits grew billion government stimulus programs have resulted in tremendous liquidity in addition as we have seen in other times of economic uncertainty both retail and commercial customers are conserving cash in the safety of their comerica accounts as expected the decline in interest rates had an impact on net interest income in this ultralow rate environment we continue to carefully manage loan and deposit pricing to attract and maintain customer relationships comerica has a long history of prudent credit underwriting which has allowed us to manage through many economic cycles despite the current period of unprecedented disruption our portfolio has performed well and while we have seen some negative migration it has thus far been manageable nevertheless there remains a great deal of uncertainty about the duration and severity of the impacts related to covid19 after taking a large provision in the first quarter we further increased our credit reserves to over billion or excluding the sbaguaranteed ppp loans we are staying close to our customers and are working to address their needs at this point we believe our reserves are appropriate and that we are well positioned with regard to noninterest income we saw a growth of quarteroverquarter with our strong card franchise being a major contributor overall we have continued to maintain our expense discipline however covid19 related expenses as well as external card processing costs resulted in an increase in expenses for the quarter capital remains strong and we further bolstered our tier ratio by issuing million in preferred stock we remain focused on maintaining our attractive dividend and deploying our capital to support growth recent conversations ive had with employees and customers reflect the challenges of the current environment especially as we have seen an uptick in covid19 cases however while it is very difficult to predict the path forward i sense longerterm optimism based on the countrys overall economic resiliency i continue to be comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 inspired by the spirit and determination demonstrated by my comerica colleagues our customers and the many communities we serve and now ill turn the call over to jim to review the quarter in more detail james j herzog executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide average loans increased billion or in the second quarter average loans in our mortgage banker business which serves mortgage companies were at an alltime high increasing billion due to very strong refi activity and seasonal spring home sales as far as corporate banking you may recall that large companies began to draw down lines late in the first quarter to build liquidity buffers in a time of great uncertainty those advances have begun to decline but the full quarter effect contributed to a million increase to corporate banking average balances general middle market increased million and business banking increased million aided by ppp loan fundings also commercial real estate loan growth continued driven by multifamily projects where we work with proven developers who provide substantial equity upfront providing a partial offset to the strong growth loans decreased at national dealer with lower inventory levels as expected periodend loans were stable and very close to the record billion reported march increases in loans to small business and a peak in mortgage banker loans at quarter end were offset by lower national dealer balances and customers reducing working capital needs and leverage in the uncertain environment line utilization decreased to just over mainly due to the drop in national dealer usage commitments decreased about million with increases in corporate banking and general middle market more than offset by declines in energy equity fund services and mortgage banker loan yields were a decrease of basis points from the first quarter this was mostly a result of lower interest rates onemonth libor the rate we are most sensitive to declined basis points in addition lower yielding ppp loans weighed on our total loan yield this was partly offset ph by the offsetting actions we are taking particularly adding libor ph in force when possible indiscernible deposits increased or billion as shown on slide with growth in nearly every business line as curt mentioned customers are prudently conserving and maintaining excess cash balances periodend deposits increased billion led by general middle market business banking corporate banking and retail deposit growth outpaced loan growth resulting in a decline to our loantodeposit ratio to and helped increase balances indiscernible to over billion at quarter end the average cost of interestbearing deposits was basis points a decrease of basis points from the first quarter our prudent management of relationship pricing in a lower rate environment our large proportion of noninterestbearing deposits as well as the floating rate nature of our wholesale funding drove our total funding cost to only basis points for the quarter as you can see on slide the yield on the mbs portfolio declined just a couple of basis points helped by the fact that in the first quarter as rates began to fall we opportunistically prepurchased a portion of second quarter expected payments yields on recent purchases have been around basis points we had a moderate increase in prepaids in the second quarter however this did not have a significant impact on the portfolios ph comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 duration or the unamortized premium which remains relatively small we expect payments to range in the million to million per quarter range for the nearterm we are considering opportunistically putting some of our excess liquidity to work by increasing the portfolio as market conditions allow turn to slide net interest income declined million to million and the net interest margin was a decline of basis points relative to the first quarter the major drivers for the negative net impact of lower rates which totaled million or basis points in the margin as well as an increase in excess liquidity which reduced the margin by basis point interest income on loans decline to million and reduced the margin basis points lower interest rates on loans alone had an impact of million and basis points on the margin there was a million or basis point impact from lower nonaccrual interest activity higher balances add million and fees on the margin added million over half of the combined increase in volume and fees was related to ppp loans which had a net negative impact of basis points on the margin other portfolio dynamics contributed million of basis point which mainly reflected our success in adding libor force to loans interest on deposits of the fed had a million negative impact or basis points on the margin the lower fed funds interest rate reduced net interest income by million or basis points in the margin higher balances of the fed added million but resulted in a basis point drag in the margin deposit costs declined by million and added basis points to the margin primarily a result of our prudent management of deposit pricing as interest rates declined as i previously discussed finally with lower rate and to a lesser extent lower balances wholesale funding costs declined by million adding basis points to the margin in the third quarter we will received the full quarter benefit of the june maturity of million in senior debt and made a repayment of million in fhlb advances as well as a further planned reduction of billion in fhlb advances as a reminder given the nature of our portfolio our loans reprice very quickly also we continue to closely monitor the competitive environment and our liquidity position as we manage deposit pricing overall credit quality was solid as shown on slide net chargeoffs were million or basis points and only million or basis points excluding energy loans we continue to work closely with our customers carefully reviewing their current and projected financial performance and adjusting risk ratings as appropriate this is reflected in the million increase in criticized loans general middle market criticized loans increased million primarily related to the migration of leverage auto and social distancing loans as expected energy criticized loans increased million the total criticized portion of the portfolio remains low at of loans nonperforming loans also remained low at basis points a modest increase over the first quarter excluding energy nonperforming loans decreased in summary we started the cycle from a position of strength with very low nonperforming and criticized loans and migration so far has been manageable turning to slide as far as the amounts the economy improved for the quarter however it does remain weak and the outlook continues to be uncertain with the unprecedented impacts of the covid19 pandemic particularly related to social distancing our cecl modeling includes significant recession we have been experiencing followed by a slow recovery more severe assumptions were used in the qualitative adjustments made for certain segments this resulted in an increase in our allowance for credit losses to billion our credit reserve ratio comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 was excluding ppp loans which were guaranteed by the sba so carry variable risk and the majority are expected to be forgiven over the next six months our current reserve coverage for npls was strong at times again we are well positioned with the relatively high credit reserve and low nonperforming assets as illustrated we believe our disciplined underwriting diverse portfolio and deep expertise will assist us in managing through this pandemic recession energy loans which are outlined on slide were billion at quarterend and represent of our total loans ep loans make up about of the energy portfolio and energy services which is considered the riskiest segment was only million the allocation of loan reserves to energy loans remained above as fluctuating oil and gas prices have resulted in increases in criticized and nonaccrual loans however chargeoffs decreased quarteroverquarter spring redeterminations are complete and on average borrowing bases have declined as we have done through previous cycles we aim to work with our customers to cure deficiencies through repayment over time in general our ep customers have less leverage than the last energy downturn are hedged to varying degrees and are acting prudently cutting costs and reducing capex in order to preserve liquidity with more than years of serving this industry we have deep expertise and remain focused on working with our energy customers as they navigate this cycle slide provides detail in segments that we believe pose higher risk in the current environment weve seen only limited negative migration in the social distancing segment and we applied a more severe economic forecast therefore we believe we are wellreserved for these loans also note that this segment is relatively granular and our exposure to any one of these industries is not significant our automotive reduction exposure primarily consists of loans to tier and tier suppliers many of these customers experienced disruptions in manufacturing however production has begun to ramp up we have deep expertise and a long history of working in this cyclical sector while nonaccrual loans are only million criticized loans have increased and as a result we increased the reserve allocation ultimately we believe losses will be manageable leveraged loans are where you often see the first indication of stress while balances are stable criticized loans increased as expected our leveraged loans tend to be middle market relationshipbased customers with sponsors management teams and industries we know well also our sweet spot would be at a lower end of the ph larger spectrum and we avoid the highly leveraged covenantlike deals that have been more prevalent in the industry in recent years as for payment deferrals and forbearance we have granted deferral requests for more than customers totaling billion in loans with substantially all considered performing at the time of deferral over the past month new requests including requests for a second deferral have been nominal noninterest income increased million as outlined in slide this included deferred comp asset returns of million a million increase from last quarter which is offset in noninterest expenses card fees were very strong and increased million due to higher transaction volume related to stimulus programs and changes in customer behavior securities trading income increased million reflecting fair market adjustments for comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 investments we hold related to our technology life sciences business there were also increases in securities gains as well as customer derivative income which included a lower credit valuation adjustment on the other hand poor economic conditions weighed on several fee categories deposit service charges declined million with reduced cash management activity lower money market rates weighed on brokerage and fiduciary income and foreign exchange activity decreased with the decline in economic activity turning to expenses on slide salaries and benefits increased million with annual merit and additional compensation paid to colleagues who are not able to work remotely or worked overtime on bbb loans deferred comp increased million as i mentioned on the previous slide this is partially offset by a seasonal decrease in payroll taxes outside processing increased million primarily related to higher card transaction volume and bbb loan initiation we continue to invest for the future and prepare for the return to normalcy while maintaining our expense discipline comericas conservative approach to capital and liquidity has positioned us well to navigate the current environment our capital levels remained strong with an estimated cet1 of as shown on slide in the second quarter we issued million in preferreds this was the next logical step in optimizing our capital base adding approximately basis points to our tier ratio which is our binding constraint we opportunistically took advantage of market conditions and received a very strong response reflected on the favorable pricing of earlier this year our board increased our dividend to per share and declared that level for the july dividend payment as the dividend is determined careful consideration is given to expected earnings power and capital needs to support loan growth and investment in our businesses the current dividend yield is very attractive and is supported by the strong holding company cash position we also conduct robust capital stress test to help ensure our dividend can withstand cyclical pressures as we are experiencing now while we maintain strong capital levels for the cet1 target of slide provides our outlook for the third quarter relative to the second quarter we are assuming recessionary conditions remain with continued slow improvement in gdp and unemployment however a high degree of uncertainty remains regarding the economic impact of covid19 loans to small businesses are expected to reflect the full quarter benefit of the ppp advances as it ramped up early in the second quarter and we anticipate only modest loan forgiveness in the third quarter more than offsetting this we expect loan growth to be challenging in a few business lines mortgage banker is expected to reflect lower refi volumes from record second quarter levels as well as seasonality in home sales also we expect continued reduction of liquidity draws by large corporates and lower national dealer balances as auto inventory levels decline further we expect average deposits to be stable as some customers utilize their economic stimulus payments while others work to conserve cash the net impact from rates alone on net interest income is estimated to be million to million in the third quarter relative to the second quarter this includes the full quarter effects that lower interest rates partly offset by our action to decrease deposit rates which we expect to average basis points in the third quarter reduced loan volume is expected to roughly offset a reduction of wholesale borrowings and additional day in the quarter comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 credit quality is expected to refund the economic environment with our solid credit metrics and our credit reserve at about of loans for the second quarter we believe we are wellpositioned however the path of the economy is uncertain we expect noninterest income to decline primarily due to the unusually high second quarter levels for securities trading income derivative income card and deferred comp which are not expected to repeat also we believe lower marketrelated activity should have an impact on investment banking and fiduciary fees partly offsetting this as the economy improves we expect an increase in areas such as deposit service charges as commercial activity picks up we expect a rise in technology and occupancy expenses as we catch up on initiatives that have been delayed due to covid19 we are committed to investing in our future so that we are wellpositioned coming out of the pandemic in addition we expect an increase in charitable giving and seasonal increases in staff insurance and marketing these costs will be mostly offset by our continued focus on controlling expenses as we are closely managing discretionary spending and expect covidrelated costs to decline as far as capital i mentioned in the previous slide we expect to declare our first dividend on the preferred stock of about million which includes a ph step period from the second quarter our capital levels are healthy and we remain focused on managing our capital with the goal of providing an attractive return to our shareholders now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim and as shared in my opening remarks im extremely proud of the comerica team over our year history comerica has successfully managed through many challenging times we continue to demonstrate our resiliency and unwavering dedication to provide a high level of customer service as we navigate the covid pandemic we believe our disciplined underwriting approach and prudent customer selection resulted in superior credit performance to the last recession and is assisting us in weathering the current environment as evidenced by our solid credit metrics this quarter our diverse geographic footprint and relationship banking strategy continues to serve us well we are committed to maintaining our strong expense focus while investing for the future at uncertain times like these our ability to serve our customers using our experience and deep expertise builds and solidifies loyal relationships with strong liquidity and capital levels we are able to meet our customers financing needs and we remain focused on delivering an attractive return for our shareholders now we would be happy to take your questions comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question will come from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thanks good morning how are you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc wanted to maybe just if we can clarify if you can on slide the guidance for net interest income i just want to make sure i really understand what youre saying there because obviously the rates is a negative totally got it theres a negative sign there theres also a negative sign against ahead of the lower loan balances which are offset by the lower debt etcetera so netnet it sounds like nii is going down from here but can you just help us understand the can you quantify maybe what the lower loan balance part might be im just trying to get a sense are we talking because you do say its offset but are we talking down million or down million thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah thanks for the question we thats going to be somewhat dependent on ppp loan volume and when those prepay so there is a range of outcomes there but just to give you a general feel for where it could end up were looking at probably million to million in terms of reduced volume impact and that should be roughly offset as we mentioned by the one additional day and the lower wholesale debt and theres probably kind of a plus or minus million or million to that depending on where ppp volume goes but hopefully that boxes the range in for you ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay that actually does help quite a bit so thank you on that i guess maybe just a second question in terms of operating expenses your expenses have been fairly stable i would say over the last few quarters several of the other banks that i cover have seen sharp declines in expenses whether its lower travel or marketing or even incentive compensation can you just remind us is there anything different in terms of how youre approaching the expenses for the business where you might not be seeing that same level of benefit comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 because im assuming youre not traveling anymore or very little travel now whereas other banks might be seeing a bit more of that benefit thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah ken we are seeing some pockets of lower expenses just like i think some of our peer banks are i would point out to a couple of key differences between us and perhaps some of our peers of course you need to discount the million of deferred comp expense which is offset in noninterest income another key differentiator would be the outside processing costs that associate with our improved card fees for the quarter so we did have some very good performance in card noninterest income as you saw on the previous slide but that does come as a processing expense so that would be a layer of expense that i would suspect our peers would not have had beyond that we did have some built up in our sba program for ppp loans its possible that some of our peers had an infrastructure already and were not a real big sba lender so there was investment that went into that so i would probably point to those three things as key differentiators but we are seeing the pockets of reduced expenses and we are managing them very prudently so overall we feel pretty good about the way expenses are flowing ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning morning back to your ppp comment there i just want to see if you can give us a little bit more color around your expectation for how much of the billion in ppp production could remain on balance sheet or conversely how much of it do you expect to be forgiven thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc it continues to play out in terms of how these are viewed by the treasury but we do think that the vast majority will be forgiven right now our assumption is in the to range but that could have a plus or a minus we do think that most of them will be forgiven over the next six months but we dont see a substantial amount of that in the third quarter to the extent it does happen in the third quarter it will be at the very end of the third quarter so i dont see it affecting average balances to a material degree but thats something that i think we and everyone else in the street is keeping a close eye on in terms of just how quickly these are forgiven and that should then work through over the next few months comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thats helpful and then separately i appreciate the color you typically give around the seasonality items impacting national dealer and mortgage can you just talk to us when it comes to the core commercial loan book outside of those portfolios what are you seeing in terms of underlying demand are you seeing anything at this point showing signs of improving demand or where do you where can you give us some color on that thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc peter you want to take that peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah john i would say in the general books the demand is still pretty muted there is activity in various markets in certain industries and were being selective and smart about the choices that we make but i cant say that youve seen a real pickup in demand across really any of the major markets but i think the companys continued to be really really responsible managing their debt managing liquidity and so that would be my answer to that right now john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thats helpful thanks for taking my questions curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you john operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the questions im just hoping you can offer a little bit more color and thoughts around the dividend i know you mentioned them in your prep remarks but i feel like there are just a bunch of countervailing issues the return to profitability certainly released some pressure capital is back in your range and then the preferred helps the indiscernible still relatively high payout though so just would be curious if your any updated thoughts you have curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah thanks scott your question is related to the dividend is that correct comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yes thats it exactly curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc you were cutting off over there first let me just say that as jim and mark and i did as well in my comments we are coming at this from a very strong capital position preferred issuance helped to strengthen that further on the tier side and always for us from a capital perspective we sort of pay dividend into two areas one is how we support our customers and continue to grow in the organization and then secondly how do we provide what we would consider a healthy and competitive dividend to our shareholders obviously theres a lot of unknowns out there around the depth and duration of the current economic health crisis but at the moment we continue to feel very comfortable both from our capital position and our dividend r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thanks and then just out of curiosity have you guys received any indication from the regulators that nonccar banks would be subject to that same newer earnings efficiency test that the ccar banks are subject to now curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc no r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right good thank you guys for taking the question operator your next question will come from the line of steve alexopoulos with jpmorgan curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everybody maybe to follow up on scotts question it seems like you guys are in the same bucket as many regional banks where you may not be forced to cut through your dividend but just because rates you may end up having a very high payout ratio so as you think about recommending to the board right the dividend where it is right now how sustainable do you view that over the intermediate term james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah steven its jim we do very long range forecasting of various sorts some various scenarios and we actually feel pretty good about our ppnr on the foreseeable future de run out of the range of credit outcomes comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 and if you layered in just the number of what ill call normal credit run rates it appears the dividend is very sustainable from a payout ratio and there is some capital left over to grow assets to serve our customers so i think the key factor there is how long this credit cycle continues pursuing return to some level of credit normalcy in the not too distant future which we do expect that to normalize and we feel good about the ongoing ppnr and normalized credit costs we are expecting to maintain the dividend and grow assets to support our customers so we feel pretty good about it curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jim you might comment about liquidity of the parent company as well james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah thats certainly not an issue we have more than enough liquidity at the parent company especially with the preferred issuance we did of million in may so we have we were somewhat of awash in liquidity at the parent company and it really does come down as youve already pointed out to the payout ratio that is the key we do have strong capital level staying sin any type of over ratio should that occur again like we had in the first quarter but again the key thing is the ongoing longterm ppnr stream and normalized credit costs in our modeling that is capable of sustaining the dividend steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then if we look at where you saw most of the increases in the criticized loans in the auto production and leveraged loans what does the reserve that youre not carrying on each of those buckets james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc melinda melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah this is melinda we do not disclose individual reserve levels for each of those individual carveout portfolios what i would say is we feel very good about our billion in reserve and our coverage ratio the entire reserve is available for credit losses really in any of our portfolios and the only one that we have disclosed obviously is energy and we feel really get about that plus steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then you i think you said a covenantlight of the leveraged loans was small can you call out exactly what portion is covenantlight thanks melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 i dont know what that number would be but i will tell you that we generally just dont play in that space again our leveraged loan book is really its a wraparound for our middlemarket relationship banking strategy and our percentage of loans in the large corporate space in leverage is very very small steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful thanks for taking my questions curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks steve operator your next question comes from the line of jennifer demba with suntrust curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jennifer brandon king q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey this is brandon king on for jennifer curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc hey brandon brandon king q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey so i wanted to hear more color on the energy portfolio i believe in your prepared remarks you stated that chargeoffs were actually lower sequentially for that book and i wanted just to know your thoughts currently what youre seeing now as to where you see chargeoffs trending going forward curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc melinda for the chargeoff in the energy book going forward melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah yeah let me talk a little bit about how were how we view energy obviously this is the segment that we are most concerned about and have been for quite some time this enter this industry was under stress prior to covid and then obviously with the demand shock that took place because of covid and stayathome that escalated some of the concerns that we have comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 all that being said we do feel a little bit better about where we are at the end of  than we were at the end of  compared to where we were this time last quarter prices have stabilized around a barrel and we have a very heavy oilweighted business the capital markets however are still nonexistent and thats whats really leading to our chargeoffs it would be really difficult and impossible for me to predict exactly what were going to see in terms of timing of chargeoffs but just given that elevated level of nonaccrual for this portfolio specifically we would expect to continue to see chargeoffs in the coming quarters this is a portfolio of very large sophisticated borrowers as jim mentioned they have lower leverage than what we saw in the last downturn and quite frankly are operating as appropriately as they could in this really difficult environment in terms of shutting in wells controlling capex and expenses and working with us where there are any deficiencies in borrowing basis to put repayment plans in place brandon king q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you and just a quick followup were there any thoughts around selling some of those energy loans like another bank has or was that not even a consideration melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc no we are very committed to the business and have no plans on selling the portfolio brandon king q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you very much curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you brandon operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi i just wanted to followup on scott and steves question on the dividend so jim looking forward as i look at consensus estimates theres definitely plenty of room in terms of dividend coverage for the common dividend and im just wondering the fed test is backwardlooking and so if we use dividend coverage according comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 to the fed according to consensus by the first quarter you wont be covering your dividend if you look back in terms of your average net income before preferred because of that loss quarter in the first quarter and i guess the question really here is if you havent gotten any color from your regulators about dividend coverage for nondfast banks the lookback in terms of dividend coverage in terms of how the fed calculates it just doesnt matter to you in terms of how we should think about dividend sustainability as it relates just to coverage james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc that is correct we have very strong capital levels and if you look at the basel rules its really not until the bank dips into the conservation buffer that the indiscernible net income test should really be applicable so it seems to me what the fed has done with ccar banks is theyve essentially used that buffer above the conservation buffer and say and essentially said it doesnt matter were going to platform for a net income test regardless now thats a special ccar view that regulators have does not apply to us as curt had mentioned and we feel really good about the capital levels how far above we are of the conservation buffer were about bps above it so we just dont have any concerns about dipping into that and we should be good to go just from an overall check the box where the key things were concerned about payout ratio parent company cash capital levels no concerns there erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and my second question is theres been a lot of discussions now among investors in terms of valuing banks on a normalized returns postpandemic recession particularly for stocks that are trading below tangible book and as we think about the net interest income run rate post all the ppp noise postforgiveness were calculating something like your net interest income would have been million without ppp and as we think about the back half of is that a good jumping off point in terms of how we should think about your core net interest income power and what are the puts and takes that would take you above or below that run rate james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah there are a number of factors that are floating out there that i think it would be beneficial to the run rate of course were not done with deposit pricing so theres a little bit to go there and we have managed that pretty prudently up to this point the other big x factor is going to be loan pricing which obviously makes up the vast majority of our earning assets our loan portfolio rolls over a little more quickly than the typical thing its a little bit shorter and we are seeing expanded pricing in the industry and more ph low floors libor floors are becoming more predominant and so i think thats a big x factor that there is the potential to well exceed the numbers that youre quoting there for but theres just a number of unknowns the deposit pricing the loan pricing i mentioned that we are going to opportunistically invest some of our excess liquidity in securities which should give us a small bump so there are some things that we can do to head off this interest rate impact but it just remains to be seen how much of it we can offset comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc ph it all depends how libor tracks given how its tracked thus far if theres some recovery in the economy if the fed doesnt take action dividend or libor 30day libor below basis points james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thats right it does seem to have bottomed out and were preparing for the fact that it may not go up but that would certainly be a big benefit to the extent it did erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch helpful thank you so much curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you erika operator your next question will come from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i just fair to clarify if you were a ccar bank youd probably be forced to cut the dividend but since youre not a ccar bank you dont need to because you have such strong capital ratios that can help you weather the storm and maybe thats the benefit of being a smaller more simple company is that correct curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yes mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay look theres not an easy answer to this but the covid cases have been on the rise in two of your three markets texas california and so youve mentioned as the economy improves and it does seem to be improving in some ways on the other hand theres a risk that covid cases lead to death that lead to shutting down like youre seeing in california and some other parts so whats your best guess on the course of covid and specifically some of your markets curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 well thats the thousanddollar question mike its really hard for us to predict and as youve pointed out we are seeing a rise in several of our markets also remember that we have operations in arizona and florida as well and theyre seeing a rise there the michigan market did a really good job of addressing the shutdown early on and its not seen quite the same resurgence but in texas and california what i would say is overall is that youre talking about two very strong economies that came into this situation from a position of strength california remains the sixth largest economy in the world extremely diverse texas has had a tremendous inflow of population and net job creation and strengthened real estate values etcetera so theres a lot of positives that both of those economies bring into this situation if theres a question that youre weathering the storm right now i think youre located in california so youre experiencing it firsthand i do think the governors of both states and local municipalities are doing the right things and trying to step back and create some social distancing and trying to reinforce some of the guidelines around mask etcetera and so i think theres some shortterm retrenchment that will occur but we feel good about some of the longerterm perspective of both of those markets again a lot of that ties to just the overall strength of those two economies mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you mike operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning good morning you mentioned loan deferrals have stabilized and only a modest number have asked for a second deferral my question is at what point do you make the decision to move the loan to nonperforming status and maybe taking some charges curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc melinda melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah this is melinda thanks for the question so ill start my comments really with the commercial portfolio and we have about borrowers that we granted payment deferrals for a relatively small percentage of the total comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 book probably most importantly many of those requests came at the very beginning of the pandemic and they were really insurance policies for our customers they did not know what to expect going into shelterinplace they also did not know that the ppp program would be launched so they asked for them and where they did we granted them of those commercial borrowers resumed paying after about days into the pandemic and the majority of these payment deferrals for the commercial book will roll off in july and august we do not expect to see any credit losses from these particular actions and again i think as jim mentioned the level of requests for a second deferral has been extremely low the consumer book again this is not a big space for us but we did have about customers ask for payment deferrals its only about million in principal balances the vast majority of those will be rolling off between the month of august and october and second requests there have been modest peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc great thank you and just to follow up on the securities portfolio what are the reinvestment rates on those cash flows at securities and kind of what are you looking for in terms of the environment to use some of that excess liquidity and put it into securities james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah obviously its a bit of a challenging rate environment so were going to consider a mix of securities obviously we want to keep any excess liquidity tied up in vehicles that are very liquid so we would see the majority of ph with the treasuries which are in the to bp range right now which doesnt sound like a lot but its better than the bps of the fed and given it is very likely that we dont really see longterm rates over the next one to two years taking any kind of significant move but well blend in with that some mortgagebacked securities which are also somewhat liquid and our yielding as i mentioned in my opening script well over so we think we can get a weighted average that would be meaningful to helping us just a little bit in terms of the run rate and utilizing some of this excess liquidity and really if you look at the prepayment rates on both or the prepayment maturities coming up both for our treasury portfolio we have about billion coming up over the next yearandahalf two years and of course mba prepaids are significant right now for the whole industry as i mentioned you can almost view these as just a preinvestment for maturities coming up in the nearterm so we feel pretty good and we think its an elegant way to just prepurchase and also get a few extra dollars into the ppnr run rate peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks very much curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you peter operator your next question comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning gary gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning thanks i hope you guys are all doing well just a quick question on your cecl methodology slide i think slide you highlight your unemployment and gdp assumptions could you just remind us where those assumptions stood when we had the strong april melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah this is melinda id like to remind everybody that in  we used the most severe economic scenarios that we could in fact we kept our books open a couple of extra days to make sure i mean as you recall there were so many things unfolding right at the time we were working on our cecl reserve process so we had very severe unemployment and gdp and oil oil in particular in the and for an extended period of time it would have been at so for our current forecast again we consider a range of third party generated forecasts as jim mentioned all of those were recessionary with varying degrees of severity and length again we took our biggest hit in the first quarter which is why our reserve build and provision was higher than many of our peers for the current forecast period we have unemployment at oil at about and stabilizing at by the end of and peak gdp which was fourth quarter of being recaptured by gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you gary operator your next question comes from the line of brian foran with autonomous research curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning brian brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp hey good morning i wonder on ppp and this is as much an industry question as a comerica question but im curious for your views theres one school of thought out there among investors thats definitely strip out ppp net interest income underlying trajectory is not great has a problem for earnings but theres another school of thought thats kind of like look these grants theyre kind of grants they lower the probability of default for a lot of borrowers maybe some of the deposits stick around maybe some new clients were acquired and maybe even some of these businesses borrow more as they survive and recover so for people having that debate around comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 how should we think about ppp is it onetime that gets stripped out or is there maybe more ongoing business benefit than people realize what are some of the puts and takes youd speak to curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc let me brian make a couple of comment on the front end and then well turn to jim for a little bit more detail there first of all we were honored to participate in the program and we think it was the right thing for our country and it was the right thing for so many of our customers especially the smaller businesses that just really would not have had an alternative and our team worked extremely hard to make sure all of our customers were taken care of and we do believe that there will be some additional stimulus we dont know what it looks like it could be a second round of our ppp well prepare to respond if thats the case it could be a stimulus check it could be something else that may be coming we are prepared we are participating in the main street lending program we do not expect demand there to be very high but we will be using that and be accommodative wherever it makes sense for our customers and then jim maybe you want to add on to that james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc i was just going to add and it kind of hearkens back to erikas question in terms of what could be lost revenue when ppp goes away id say theres a time and a purpose for any type of lending and for right now our customers want to make sure they can manage the crisis and thats really the purpose of the ppp loans and as curt said were honored to do that for our customers and really for the country as a whole there will come a time where those loans are forgiven and our customer is ready to start investing again and at that point in time well start hopefully investing in capex and borrowing increasing our working capital levels so i think youll see one type of lending just transition into another eventually i dont think its necessarily ph a hole thats going to be created brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp thank you and maybe in a similar spirit its interesting on your slide on credit the divergence were seeing in criticized assets versus chargeoffs and npls and again this is something not unique to you a lot of peers are showing that as well i mean you talked to some of the good experience so far in deferrals you mentioned just now maybe more government support coming do you think all of this has just delayed the normal relationship between criticized and loss or do you think is fundamentally altered and lowered it ie the criticized theyre not going to flow through the npl and chargeoffs in the magnitude they would in a normal recession or i guess this isnt a normal recession but given the economic numbers were seeing melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah this is melinda thanks for the question i think id start off by saying that comericas long history of kind of conservative and disciplined approach to underwriting certainly plays well for us when we do have economic cycles were not the most aggressive in the good times but we are very very disciplined and that gives us some flexibility to continue to support our customers through these types of situations overall again excharge offs or exenergy chargeoffs were only basis points comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 we started into this cycle from a position of strength as curt mentioned i mean the portfolio was about as good and clean other than energy as weve seen our borrowers reacted to the pandemic better than i think we all would have expected theyve demonstrated resiliency the ppp program was really really impactful to our customer base i dont think we can underestimate that this billion went into the majority of that went into our middle market and business banking portfolios which is where a lot of our small business customers reside and if you look at the percentage of ppp money versus what those customers have in terms of lending relationships with us its a very very meaningful number you can almost think of it as quasi equity coming in once those loans are forgiven where we are seeing stress and deterioration we are adjusting our risk ratings appropriately most of the stress that weve seen so far hasnt really been centered in our leverage book automotive and to a lesser degree that social distancing portfolio were monitoring their performance very closely we look at liquidity we have greater visibility into each of these borrowers and we would expect any losses that we do experience to be manageable and again weve got billion in reserves and a coverage ratio to really handle pretty much anything that comes at us brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp thank you i appreciate all the thoughts curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you brian operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken operator ken you may be on mute curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc oh is that better sorry about that good morning everyone curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc no problem comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc i just wanted to ask given that the mortgage banker and dealer floor plan are among the most volatile of the loan lines and given that those two businesses are going through some unique cyclical things positives and negatives can you just kind of walk us through whats happening with each of those businesses and what youre expecting in terms of normal seasonality and the outlook for each thanks peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah sure ken this is peter ill talk to mortgage first what were seeing there is a bit different i think than maybe patterns in the past where in the third quarter were projecting it to come down a little bit along with the projections for the industry and refi particularly maybe up a little bit in purchase and so weve seen amazing activity in that business in the second quarter across the industry and were not necessarily thinking that that will continue in the third quarter where in the past maybe it has but so thatll be a little bit of a divergence and then on dealer you just continue to see less i mean if youve been to a car lot lately theres not a lot of cars out there floor plan continues to be coming down i do think that theres the possibility of that picking back up as we start making cars again in michigan and so to the extent that theres more funding for consumers and ability to buy cars then youll start to see turnover ph as a loss but i dont know that that necessarily means to more increases in floor plan lending in that space either so the normal trends are a little bit off maybe from what weve seen in prior years probably be next year before we get to kind of a regular seasonal pattern in those businesses ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and one followup on the capital front as you mentioned you raised million of preferreds as did much of the industry this quarter when spreads tightened given that preferreds are still a very small part of roa and youve always had cet1 be a major part of your capital stack is this the beginning of trying to get that into better balance over time or was this episodic and kind of a onetime given where market was james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah this is jim were going to leave our options open there we have no immediate plans to fill in the rest of the stack procure one ph with preferreds but its something i could see we could see happening over time i dont see it in the nearterm but well continue to monitor the market and our own rwa growth and capital levels and make the appropriate assessment in the future ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thanks very much guys curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning just a question or two on the other social distancing loans its a little over billion just looking at the footnotes it looks like wineries and breweries were removed i was wondering were there any changes in the second quarter at all and any portfolios within that other category that experienced an elevated increase in criticized loans melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc the short answer to that is no again its a very granular portfolio and the migration really in that whole social distancing category has been relatively modest terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you then just a quick followup for jim i was wondering if you could quantify the covid19 and ppp related expenses last quarter they were called out a couple of times on the call today and in the presentation james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah there are of course it gets a little bit squishy in terms of what you include and exclude because there were expenses realized some are very obviously some not and of course there are some savings that would offset that i heard some of those mentioned earlier but broadly speaking i would characterize it as we had about million of covid and ppp expenses that were more extraordinary in the second quarter we actually see the majority of those continue but it will come down but we will see a little or half of those continue some of it in the form of contributions which we consider part of the overall covid and ppp environment but it was meaningful in the second quarter and we will see those come down gradually over time this year curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc i would like to just add jim that we really work whereas necessary to continue to support our employees through this crisis so you would agree that there are things that we need to do from a benefits perspective to support our employees we will do that and we are very proud of the efforts were making around giving back to the community and thats an important necessary thing right now especially related to small businesses and some of the efforts that weve made to help in a number of communities that we serve yeah terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks for taking my questions comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 operator your next question will come from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking the question youve got some good disclosure in on energy i was just wanted to return to that just roughly speaking where would you say your borrower base is really making able to cash flow these loans is it as low as a barrel or is it realistically melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc this is melinda in general we have its really important to remember that a good portion of our portfolio is very wellhedged in fact we actually saw hedging go up in the second quarter as prices kind of rebounded into that a barrel we do have a portion of our portfolio that can cash flow absent any capex at oil and oil but its really unique and specific to each companys balance sheet and their hedging strategy so i couldnt really give you an exact percentage on that brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and as you you touched on this earlier in the call in terms of the conservatism of your underwriting historically as you look at this at the energy sector now does it continue to kind of meet your criteria or do you see the entire sector under real secular pressure that may make this something you want to kind of extract yourself from over time melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc well ill just start by saying that again we are committed to the energy business and although this has obviously been a challenging time weve been in this business for decades weve been through many cycles and although this one has the added benefit of pandemic a worldwide pandemic we feel really good about our participation in this industry and plan on continuing that so no change in strategy and peter is there anything else youd add for that peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc i would just iterate that again weve been in this business four years and i think through that theres probably three or four cycles that weve been through so were committed to it and intend to stay in the business brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2020 okay thank you operator ill now turn the call back over to you curt farmer chairman and ceo for any further remarks curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc well thank you always for your interest in
