thank you for joining our call today we reported first quarter earnings per share of driven by continued loan growth a favorable rate environment and effective management of balance sheet credit and capital despite the recent industry disruption we affirm the strength of our core deposit base by successfully retaining our relationships while we saw some deposit pressure it was predominantly localized and very manageable our prudent risk management had us well prepared our effective liquidity strategy allowed us to remain laserfocused while seamlessly supporting customers as we opened a significant number of new accounts we remain focused on business as usual winning new opportunities attracting talent underwriting credit and expanding relationships we believe our strong deposit franchise is now even more attractive and stable with a lower percentage of uninsured excess deposits and less concentration with pricesensitive customers moving to a summary of our results on slide broadbased loan growth and increased noninterest income exceeded expectations credit remained a key strength for the quarter and although we saw modest migration we were starting from very low levels despite some pressures related to funding costs and expenses we maintained a solid efficiency ratio and produced a robust roe and tier capital ratio complementing our compelling financial results we achieved significant milestones including our new partnership with ameriprise aimed at further elevating our wealth management customer experience digital tools and capabilities the launch of our new investment banking group and the national expansion of our small business banking platform strengthened our solutions for customers throughout their lifecycle further these initiatives advance the priority of increasing our mix of noncapital consuming fee income turning to slide we generated earnings of million or per share in the first quarter average loans grew almost billion average deposits decreased billion due primarily to normal first quarter seasonality and customer utilization of funds related to ph feds monetary actions credit quality outperformed with net recoveries in our criticized loan percentages remained well below our historical average expenses were elevated due to pension and several larger notable items but we maintained a solid efficiency ratio at all we retained our strong capital position with an estimated cet1 ratio of it was a remarkable quarter for comerica and im excited about our future and our ability to support our customers while delivering compelling results for our shareholders ill now turn the call over to jim to review the quarter in more detail james j herzog senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide broad based loan growth exceeded expectations as average balances increased commitments grew across most business lines up from the fourth quarter of utilization increased modestly to but remained below historical averages growth in our commercial real estate business of over million continued to be driven largely by construction of multifamily and industrial projects originated over the last two years in addition to the slower pace of payoffs our commercial real estate strategy remains highly selective with a focus on class a projects and our office exposure is limited national dealer services loans grew over million as a result of new relationships and continued customer ma wealth management and middle market also contributed to our strong loan growth elevated interest rates lack of housing inventory and normal seasonality continue to pressure mortgage banker as average loans declined to million for the quarter the mba forecast expects higher volumes in the second and third quarters consistent with a normal spring and summer buying season slide provides an overview of our deposit activity quartertodate deposits through the first week of march trended in line with guidance as customers continued to deploy funds into their business and we experienced expected seasonality following the march industry events excess balance diversification efforts by our customers further impacted deposits we saw our peak impact in the days immediately following concentrated in certain customers with balances well in excess of their operational needs outflows moderated and in the last two weeks of march we saw a return to a more normal pattern and that trend has continued the greatest outflows were localized in select portfolios with a muted impact across the rest of our businesses despite onboarding new customers in tls balances declined as this disruptive sector diversified deposits portfolios with larger than average deposit relationships such as corporate banking and select customers in middle market california also saw a diversification within a portion of their excess balances these three business lines saw disproportionately high deposit growth through quantitative easing and much of the decline offset that increase utilization of an fdic reciprocal deposit product was an effective strategy and through quarter end our customers placed billion in balances in that solution deposit diversification efforts were concentrated in more pricesensitive customers and the increase in deposit pricing to basis points was driven by the cumulative impact of previous pricing changes our strategic relationship focus was proven successful as we retained and in fact grew our total number of core deposit relationships slide highlights the strength of our core deposit franchise it is important to note how elevated deposit levels have been since with that context our current position is much stronger than prior to the pandemic as we have higher overall deposits a better loantodeposit ratio and a lower percentage of uninsured deposits some look to uninsured deposits as the primary metric to detect risk of elevated outflows however we believe a more comprehensive view is appropriate as a commercial bank it is natural to have a higher relative percentage of uninsured deposits the majority of which are noninterest bearing which we view as a key strength and a proxy for operating accounts with of our commercial noninterest bearing deposits utilizing treasury management services at an average of more than seven treasury management products for a middle market customer we are integrated with our customers daily operations we feel our market and business diversification favorable deposit mix commercial orientation and connectivity into our customers operations combine to create greater relative stability in our deposit base comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 we see opportunities to even further improve the resiliency of our deposits including strategic investments underway to enhance payments digital customer transformation and wealth management in addition to our national small business banking strategy which should drive granular deposit growth over time ultimately our deposit base has always been and continues to be a differentiating strength and we expect even more stability with a more favorable level of uninsured and a high percentage of operating deposits successful execution of our liquidity strategy proved effective as shown in slide following the following the industry events in march we conservatively increased our cash position and our abundant liquidity allowed uninterrupted support of our customers and businesses usual operations our quarterend loantodeposit ratio was remaining below our 15year average and very light unsecured funding maturities create flexibility to manage funding needs and cash levels over time periodend balances in our securities portfolio on the slide declined over million as paydowns of maturities offset the positive marktomarket adjustment of million the total unrealized loss after tax of billion affects our book value but not our regulatory capital ratios our securities strategy remains unchanged as we stopped reinvesting in the third quarter of from that peak through the end of we expect natural portfolio attrition of approximately billion and a improvement in unrealized securities losses we maintain our entire portfolio as available for sale providing full transparency and management ph flexibility as our portfolios pledge to enhance our liquidity position we do not foresee any need to sell our portfolio and therefore unrealized losses should not impact income turning to slide net interest income decreased million to million as the benefit of higher rates and loan volume were offset by the impact of lower deposit balances deposit pricing and fewer days we still saw a net positive impact due to rising rates and net interest income remained incredibly strong relative to our historical results slide demonstrates our desirable interest rate sensitivity profile successful execution of our strategy and the current composition of our balance sheet favorably positioned us with minimal negative exposure to a gradual basis points or basis points on average decline in interest rates as intended our strong noninterest income stream is now more insulated from rate reductions credit quality continues to be a strength of our franchise and remained excellent as outlined on slide with million in net recoveries nonaccrual loans declined and inflows to nonaccruals remained low at million loan growth and the weakening economic outlook drove the million provision and the allowance for credit losses increased modestly to criticized loans increased but remained well below historical levels as we saw expected credit normalization in portfolios prone to pressure from the elevated rate environment office is not part of her primary strategy only making up of our total commercial real estate line of business of this limited office exposure a majority is suburban with strong contractual financial support from sponsors within the overall commercial real estate portfolio pressure from the elevated rate environment contributed to a modest increase in criticized loans and we expect continued manageable migration in the coming quarters robust fee generation increased noninterest income by million relative to a seasonally high fourth quarter as shown in slide capital markets income grew million and is now distinguished in our reporting to reflect the investment and opportunity in that business derivative income in investment banking offset the comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 seasonal lighter quarter for syndication fees brokerage benefited from the rate environment and strategic private wealth investments contributed to growth in fiduciary income continued expansion of our noncapital consuming fee income remains a priority and with growth in nearly every customer category we are excited to see the results from this emphasis turning to expenses on slide we had a number of notable expenses in the quarter including million related to modernization initiatives million of which were attributable to the ameriprise transaction while litigationrelated expenses and operating losses were elevated the largest drivers related to isolated events quarteroverquarter nonsalary pension expense increased million as expected salaries and benefits increased million driven by higher stockbased compensation with first quarter grants inflationary pressures and attracting talent fdic insurance increased million driven by the higher statutory assessment rate and the impact of funding late in the quarter occupancy came down million with the reduction in lease termination fees lower rental expense and a seasonal change in property tax rates both consulting and advertising declined from a seasonally high fourth quarter with a track record of proven discipline we are committed to carefully managing expenses balancing necessary investments for the future and overall earnings power in order to maintain a solid efficiency ratio over time slide provides details on capital management strong profitability continued to generate significant capital to support loan growth our cet1 is estimated at above our target and we were excited to announce a increase in our quarterly dividend for common stock at april our conservative excess cash position impacted our tangible common equity ratio adjusting for cash increase weve increased over the fourth quarter in aoci our first quarter tce ratio would have increased to expected loan growth profitability and any potential regulatory changes will continue to be carefully considered as we manage our capital strategy our outlook for is in slide and assumes no significant changes in the economic environment we expect momentum especially in our commercial real estate and national dealer services business to drive average loan growth of to we continue to expect growth in both businesses but plan to be appropriately selective supporting opportunities most aligned with our target credit pricing and relationship strategy our estimated average yearoveryear deposit decline of to assumes continued stabilization and reflects the impact from fed monetary actions that began last year in addition to the first quarter industry events despite the impact of funding we still project net interest income to be at an alltime high growing to over our record performance through effective execution of our balance sheet strategy and based on our current composition we delivered on our objective to limit rate exposure and protect a high level of net interest income credit quality has been excellent and we expect it to remain strong we continue to forecast net charge offs at the lower end of our normal basis points to basis points range and expect a gradual normalization in credit metrics we expect strong noninterest income performance to drive to growth over customerrelated income is projected to increase particularly in card due to our payment strategy and fiduciary income which benefits from rates and investments in wealth management risk management income related to our internal hedging position is forecasted to increase relative to but will vary over time as rates move fhlb dividends created a new tailwind in this quarter since we do not expect to repeat the elevated derivative volumes from we expect the yearoveryear derivative delta to offset positive momentum in other capital markets categories a reduction in our deposit service charges is expected due to an increase in commercial account eca rates and adjustments to our retail nsf fees more than offsetting growth in core treasury management income comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 with robust overall noninterest income performance in the first quarter exceeding seasonally high fourth quarter results we feel very good about our momentum despite elevated expense pressures in the first quarter we maintained our guidance for expense growth considering expected adjustments to select discretionary expenses even after including expenses related to the ameriprise transition we still expect modernization to be lower in compared to we acknowledge the dynamic nature of the current environment and plan to assess the longerterm implications of the march disruption with a culture of prudent management we expect to manage expenses as appropriate based on the new environment in summary we expect strong overall financial performance and forecast record net interest income for now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim slide highlights our compelling story risk management decisions made over the last several years prepared us to emerge from the recent disruption in a strong position we were resilient we built liquidity we protected relationships and we grew our customer base it was a great quarter for our company broadbased loan growth and robust noninterest income exceeded expectations and credit quality remained excellent we produced an roe of over and an roa of and we feel very good about our outlook comerica has long had one of the most enviable deposit franchises and now it is even better with lower uninsured deposits improved granularity and less price sensitivity in addition we have a loyal bluechip customer base robust fee income balance and interest rate exposure strong capital and an impeccable reputation for credit we are diversified in great markets to support our strategy and id be remiss if i didnt mention our tenured and tenacious colleagues who partners extraordinary well with our customers banking is based on trust trust we have in our customers and trust our customers have in us i feel this period has proven the strength of our relationship model and reaffirm comericas stable foundation as the trusted banking partner into the future thank you for your time and now wed be happy to take your questions comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions one moment please for the first question and we will first go to the line of steven alexopoulos with jp morgan please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning good morning everyone so no surprise i want to start on the deposit side first the color you provide in the slides is really helpful im curious when we look at the decline in the deposits from march through the end of the quarter im surprised that tls specifically was it a beneficiary of the svb situation and even when i look at the decline in corporate and middle market im again surprised because i would have thought the company would have been somewhat of a ph port to start right i mean youve been in markets for decades youve been with customers for decades could you take us behind the scenes what did you hear from your customers during this time in each of those and why were they moving balances away from the company peter sefzik a senior executive vice president chief banking officer comerica inc steve this is peter so i would tell you that in the very beginning for sure we actually took on a lot of accounts and curt mentioned in his remarks that we opened a number of accounts from customers that were wanting to come to comerica from the other banks that had failed so during that time we definitely took on new customers i think the average balance probably is just not as high but on the whole we saw some departures some of that is because weve got a lot of late stage also which a lot of late stage tls customers are going to have more deposits but not as much credit and so thats where you did see some diversification wanting to occur at that level but netnet if you look at our tls slide in the back we have seen deposits coming down in that space going back to second quarter of last year really so whats occurred i think in this space in general has been burning through cash so we saw that but we didnt necessarily think that we would be taking on excess deposits fleeing from svb coming to us out of this deal we did take on more accounts and we definitely saw that we also saw during the period as i mentioned already late stage fleeing but we saw some accounts sort of spreading across not just us but other banks as well out of the tls steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc what about corporate and midmarket peter sefzik a senior executive vice president chief banking officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 yeah same thing there steve i think on the corporate side in our corporate business thats our sort of national business with banking large corporates we saw diversification there as well and then middle market was mostly in california so again we havent lost in just about all of these stages we have not lost customers we have just seen diversification of excess balances that they have so we believe that theres opportunities for those to return in the future were not relying on that but we still have relationships with these customers we mostly have just seen diversification so thats really what weve seen in those three businesses that weve got outlined on the slide steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then on the noninterestbearing so you saw a pretty sharp drop in the quarter which was anticipated somewhat right because of seasonal factors but given everything that just unfolded where do you see that mix now bottoming and wheres the timeframe for that james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc good morning steven its jim ill take that question we still think that we are likely to end up very close to we did see most of the drops occur in the dda space over the course of the quarter that was not a surprise to us at all as rates continued to go up new customers would continue to be more rate sensitive we knew that a lot of reserves balances that we have were still more in dda than interestbearing we knew a lot of the seasonal outflows relative to what came in in the second half of were likely buried in the dda in fact thats where they were and then we did have some customers that switched over using some fdic products that had been in dda but for safety reasons they were attracted to the fdic products which pay a nice rate of interest so all those things moved us closer to the number we still think were going to end up right around there we moved a lot closer to it during the course of the quarter and so we still expect to have really one of the strongest ratios of noninterestbearing deposits to total deposits amongst all our peers if not well above our closest peers so we still feel really good about noninterestbearing steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great jim if i could ask you one last question which is somewhat theoretical but so interestbearing deposit costs are if the fed does start cutting rates in the second half of this year but the rates youre paying are still well below market rates how do you model this impacting your deposit cost right i mean do market rates need to move below or close to what youre paying before you could start lowering deposit rates yourself because i dont recall other periods where the banks were this far out of the money with what theyre paying and the fed could potentially start lowering market rates what do your models show you in terms of how this would flow through to your interestbearing deposit cost thanks james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah of course we do expect rates to continue to go up but relative to what might happen when rates go down its important to remember that we have a pretty wide distribution of rates paid to a variety of customers so i comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 dont really view that average the typical customer we have a lot that are well below that range a lot that are well above that range so each one of those is going to respond differently but we do think that there is some degree of symmetry in the betas that we pay on the way up and the way down the key is that there likely is a couple months lag two to three months lag when rates start to come down before we can really respond to that drop theres just that same lag that we saw on the way up but ultimately we do think well be able to start cutting pay rates if in fact the fed makes some material moves steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah we would always be sensitive to obviously the competitive landscape and what other institutions are doing as well and making sure that were taking care of our customers appropriately steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thanks for taking my questions curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks steve operator next we go to ebrahim poonawala please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc ebrahim good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning good morning i guess just on deposits so you mentioned the excess deposit diversification played a role in the quarter one give us a sense of like how much of your deposit base or nib within noninterest bearing that you would consider operational versus excess and do you see some of that still continuing as businesses and we would love some perspective around just from a customer base standpoint in terms of small businesses treasurers cfos actively thinking about diversifying like is that trend done or do we do you still expect that to continue maybe if you can start there yeah curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah good morning ebrahim ill take that and peter may want to add on in terms of what percentage were non interest bearing or operational we view them as largely operational in fact of our noninterestbearing are tied to treasury management products so from that standpoint it is a largely operational base now there are fluctuations in terms of how much they need to put on those noninterestbearing accounts to take care of comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 operational needs and what they can leverage from an eca standpoint and there probably is still just a little bit of excess in there which is why we see the ratio coming down from to down to around but we think largely that attrition is gone in terms of where the diversification efforts might go things seem pretty settled down right now and i think thats going to depend largely on just what happens to the industry in terms of other events that might happen but for now it does feel like the diversification efforts have largely slowed down and those are the trends that weve seen over the last two to three weeks three or four weeks even peter sefzik a senior executive vice president chief banking officer comerica inc yeah i would agree with that ebrahim this is peter and i would just also continue to point to where we saw most of the diversification occur and you mentioned small business in our retail franchise small business business banking middle market most of those businesses really have not seen the diversification issue its been sort of business as usual if you will people using deposits for running their businesses or what and so forth but the strength of the rest of our deposit base is something that we are really really proud of and are going to continue to lean into and so i think jim is exactly right we feel like the diversification efforts if you will at this point is pretty much stabilized ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc noted and i guess maybe just another question jim around the outlook for nii nim i was wondering if you could give a sense of the trajectory that saw to yearoveryear growth how do you see quarterly nii and nim trending from your from levels james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc ebrahim im going to probably refrain from giving as i often do from specific nim percentage guidance i think that the examples are great this quarter is a great example of why we dont like to give that with our business model being a commercial bank we do see some variations in a number of line items cash securities et cetera in this particular quarter we did put a lot of safety net level of cash on to the balance sheet which does put a drag on nim percentage and it just creates a kind of a noncorrelation between the numerator and denominator we just dont see them going in the same direction or correlating very well so the numbers that im shying away from still were obviously probably moving towards the low but i wouldnt want to get more specific than that and i would just stick to the percentage guidance that we gave for the quarter and the full year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc but jim if rates dont get cut do you expect fourth quarter nii to be the low point for the year in terms of as we think about the exit james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc we obviously we are doing a little bit of a reset with the deposit runoff and so we have the second quarter guidance out there we actually have net interest income probably growing slightly quarter to quarter after that thats a function of loan growth primarily and we do expect to get some degree of seasonal deposits probably later in the second half of the year thats beyond the day impact that you might get so we do think that were going to be on a positive trajectory from the second quarter on were just essentially resetting that baseline in the second quarter comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you peter sefzik a senior executive vice president chief banking officer comerica inc thank you operator next we have a question from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning another question on deposits for you you noted you retained a lot of the relationships and only lost some of the i guess excess balances that people were holding so in terms of the room to bring those deposits back what is the strategy here is it just to be up on grade or through ecr to bring those deposits back or is there anything else you can do and is there a level of deposits you think would flow back once this volatility subsides peter sefzik a senior executive vice president chief banking officer comerica inc manan its this is peter the last part of your question ill say is yes we believe there is a level of deposits that would flow back i would say the number one thing that we do is to talk to our customers pretty regularly we continue to believe that we provide a better customer relationship better service than other banks and quite often its not unusual for people to come back to us because they dont get the service that they wanted at another institution so i think when we get to the other side of this that will probably be the number one reason we start to see deposits flow back but i also want to iterate again as jim said thats not necessarily something were relying on in our outlook we think that we will see it but we believe that thatll just be a function of us providing great customer service i dont think were going to have to pay off for it necessarily or things like that curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah i might just emphasize too peter i dont believe that across all of our portfolios this is probably less about rate and more about sort of two things one is the sort of surge excess deposits flowing out that we saw during covid stimulus ppp et cetera and we were expecting that in the quarter that we would lose some of that and then those that have sought diversification i think as the noise level settles down across the industry and things comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 get back to normal i think weve got a good opportunity at some of those deposits coming back on balance sheet and were just staying very very close to all those customers they have access to our relationship managers but also to any of us on the leadership team as well manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then maybe to round out the discussion on the balance sheet you added a lot more short term and long term debt this quarter to boost your liquidity how should we think about the right level of liability mix outside of deposits and the right level of cash that you want to hold on the balance sheet going forward james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah those questions are connected to each other certainly the level of cash that we hold will really be strongly correlated to whats going on in the industry we always want to make sure we have abundant level of cash during turbulent times so we have been comfortable with our targeted billion level of cash prior to the disruption in the industry obviously we pushed closer to billion as we have on the slide on slide and we will hold there for some period of time until were sure of the industry has passed some of this turbulence to the extent we have loan growth of course well see that starts to go down on the funding side of the balance sheet we started with very low levels of unsecured debt as you can see on slide probably some of the lowest amongst our peers so we felt like we were in very good shape to begin with we have a lot of flexibility we did draw on a lot of fhlb during the initial days of the crisis which we thought was a very prudent thing to do the good thing is we did that in a way that gives us tremendous flexibility a lot of those maturities are laddered starting this year all the way through the next couple of years and so we have the option as those maturities come up to either roll them over or let them just mature naturally so we feel like we have a tremendous amount of flexibility but its going to depend on the environment that will drive the amount of cash we have and the amount of funding that we have on the balance sheet but we are starting from very low levels and we feel really good about our current position so were fortunate that we have that capability manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc and is that largely revenue neutral because you are raising essentially close to the fed funds rate and then youre deploying that in cash james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc there is a modest drag on that theres probably a to bp drag as i look at it and thats one of the reasons we shied away from nim percentage guidance i mean not only does cash have the capability to inflate or deflate the balance sheet but whether thats free cash coming in in the form of deposits or its cash carrying a negative spread that can make an impact on the nim percentage too so baked into the outlook we do have a fair amount of cash still there and thats one of the things that i look at as an opportunity as we move towards later in the year and into well get past that modest amount of drag from the negative spread on the cash carry comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks for taking my questions curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thank you operator operator instructions next we go to the line of brody preston with ubs please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone could i just circle back on the nii guide i just need i was just hoping to get some help tying the what the step down that you have for versus the full year guide just because if i try to run through the numbers quickly it kind of looks like at the midpoint of the guide relative to the full year guide you kind of expect like a step up in the back half of the year on the quarterly nii run rate and so can you can you help me understand sort of how we get there and how much of that assumption is driven by what you do with borrowings james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah theres a little bit of play in there as you take the midpoints of those percentages so i wouldnt put the stuff up in the second half of the year quite at that level theres just a little bit of rounding trying to navigate those mid percentages that you mentioned we do see a small step up in the second half of the year some of that is days some of that is loan growth a little bit of seasonal deposits we expect to come in so you will see a very small step up quartertoquarter as we go through the year probably not quite at the level that you just mentioned brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay thats helpful and then i guess if i could just ask one more on the deposit front and im sorry if somebody else asked this and i missed it as you think about the goforward on deposits and customer concentrations and im thinking particularly as it relates to the tls deposits what are the kind of governors that need to be put in place going forward to kind of help navigate any future liquidity events comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 im not really talking near term because i dont think a lot of us think thats going to come to pass but you never know whats going to happen going forward and so how should we think about the balance sheet flexibility in a stressed environment going forward curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah brody what i would say is that weve been in a bank for years and weve managed through lots of different cycles and one thing that weve always kept central in our approach is our relationship focus many of these deposit relationships weve had for decades and while we did see some deposit decline during this period of time we did not see it as much in our core businesses retail banking small business business banking middle market wealth management et cetera and so were going to continue to focus on those business lines we will obviously have an opportunity i think to bring back some of the deposits that we lost along the way but our focus on treasury management services our focus is on small business and retail deposits those types of things will continue to be sort of key drivers for us we cant fully control ph whether an industry issue that unfolded like it did previously but what we did control was we had a great liquidity playbook in hand and we were able to execute against that and again i think kind of on the back side of this we do believe while its not in our modeling but we do believe we have a chance to get some of these deposits back brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then just one more just on the betas and again im sorry if somebody else asked this but have you changed your thinking about your throughcycle beta at all and have you changed how you think about like what your terminal beta would be just given the deposit volatility and i guess im more trying to narrow down to the interestbearing deposit beta if you have any color around that james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yes brody we do see the betas going up above previous guidance and i think we had been more in the mid last time we gave an outlook we now see that likely hitting the point sometime this summer and then kind of hanging out there and then things get a little things starts to go down with the lag that i mentioned earlier but we will likely get up to around sometime in the early to midsummer on a cumulative basis brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it got it and thats interestbearing right james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc that is pure interestbearing all in brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc pure interestbearing brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc and i think you did say earlier that you do feel like on the way down it might happen with a lag but you do feel like youd be able to pass through the same amount of beta to the downside that you pass through on the upside james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thats right brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thank you very much for taking my questions everyone i appreciate it curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you brody operator and next we go to a question from peter winter with da davidson please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc hey good morning peter peter j winter q analyst da davidson co good morning ill switch gears on you and ask about credit could you give a little bit more color about the increase in criticized loans i know you mentioned its interestbearing with the higher rates thats impacted it but if you could give a little bit more color on that and then secondly on net chargeoffs is there much left in terms of recoveries melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah peter this from melinda so ill take the first one the increase that we saw this quarter in criticized i think jim mentioned it or curt did in his comments it really was expected i mean the reality is weve been bumping along the bottom here now for four or five quarters at exceptionally kind of nonsustainable levels so over the last couple of calls i said we would expect to see some normalization just given all the inflationary pressures that customers have been dealing with certainly the increase in interest rates so those interest rate sensitive portfolios certainly our leveraged portfolio kind of core middle market technology and life sciences and we did see credit migration this quarter in our commercial real estate book a couple hundred million that is on special mentioned credit i dont see that migrating really to any kind of loss comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 content and thats really on some projects that have pressure related to the rising interest rate environment and from a multifamily perspective a little bit of softness in a couple of submarkets in terms of leasing rates and leasing pace so that softness coupled with the increased interest burden caused a couple of those projects to move into that criticized category but again i do not see lost content in that commercial real estate book we did increase our commercial real estate reserves this quarter just as a precautionary measure but again that commercial real estate book is predominantly multifamily and industrial close to half of it is on the construction side loan to cost and that book is generally in the to range so theres a tremendous amount of equity and room in those projects to hold a little bit longer should we need to peter j winter q analyst da davidson co and then just on the recoveries for net chargeoffs melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc recoveries yeah yeah i call that as a gift that keeps on giving and quite frankly recoveries are almost impossible to predict theyve continued to surprise us really over the last four or five quarters so at some point were going to run out of that but i would expect it will still be modest levels the declining of recovery in the coming quarters ph mostly get chargeoffs thats incredibly low as well theres not a lot to recover left peter j winter q analyst da davidson co yeah and just one followup question in the 10k you had mentioned possibly looking at resuming buybacks but im just wondering just given all the uncertainty in the environment is that kind of on hold for now on buybacks james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc i would say buybacks are on hold until further notice there is a lot of uncertainty in the environment as you mentioned certainly industry uncertainty but perhaps even more importantly regulatory uncertainty for all banks we just dont know where this is going and we want to make sure that if there is any kind of regulatory change on the capital side that we can get there organically which i believe we likely very likely will be able to do but i think caution is in order in that regard and so share buyback is certainly on the sidelines in the foreseeable future peter j winter q analyst da davidson co great thanks for taking the questions curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks peter comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 operator and i will now turn the call back over to curt farmer
