favorable trends including strong deposit growth robust fee income and excellent credit quality revenue increased quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear despite the low rate environment we remain focused on expense control while supporting our revenue generating activities also we repurchased nearly million shares reducing our share count by over we generated earnings of per share and an roe of over and an roa of remain above our historic norm we continue to demonstrate our unwavering dedication to providing a high level of service and support for our customers communities and each other during the quarter we committed billion in to small business lending over a threeyear period also we appointed a national asianamerican business development manager who joined our hispanic and african american development managers to support and strengthen relationships in our communities in conjunction with this announcement we made a deposit into an asianamerican minority depository institution in regard to sustainability our esg council recently defined the most significant esg issues for our company specifically those that are most impactful for our customers and colleagues and in which we feel we can make a comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 meaningful difference we call this our esg commitment as outlined on the slide i look forward to sharing with you our continued progress in these critically important areas turning to our second quarter financial performance on slide we saw a solid loan growth in several business lines led by general middle market this was more than offset by a large decline in auto dealer floor plan due to supply constraints as well as mortgage banker due to lower refi volumes our pipeline again increased as companies ramped up with the economy reopening deposit growth continued to be very strong average balances increased or over billion to another alltime high the full quarter benefit of federal stimulus payments along with seasonality contributed to a billion increase in consumer deposits commercial deposit growth mostly reflects our customers solid profitability and capital markets activity net interest income increased million you may recall the first quarter was impacted by million in lease residual adjustments we continue to carefully manage loan and deposit pricing as well as the securities portfolio in this ultralow rate environment credit improved from already strong levels we had net recoveries of million the highest level of net recoveries in at least years criticized and nonaccrual loans declined a true reflection of our disciplined credit culture diverse portfolio and expertise in the industrys reserve our credit reserve continued to decrease and resulted in a negative provision of million as the portfolio continues to perform better than expected going into the pandemic the reserve ratio remains healthy at excluding ppp loans feegenerating activity was again robust noninterest income grew with increases in card commercial lending and fiduciary income also expenses were wellcontrolled and our efficiency ratio improved as i previously mentioned we repurchased nearly million shares during the second quarter we expect to continue to make strides towards our cet1 target keeping a close eye on loan growth trends and capital generation using our capital to support our customers and drive growth remains our top priority while providing an attractive return to our shareholders our customers and colleagues across our markets remain optimistic about the future we expect economic metrics to remain strong in the back half of the year despite labor and supply chain constraints we believe that these issues will fade with sustained economic momentum and now ill turn the call over to jim james j herzog executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide average loans decrease million as curt mentioned the biggest driver was an million decrease in national dealer services as auto inventory levels are very low due to supply chain challenges looking back two years floor plan loans were down over billion we believe that we are close to the bottom and over the next few months inventory should start to slowly rebuild and return to normal levels sometime next year mortgage banker declined approximately million coming off of the record levels reached at the end of last year seasonally higher purchase volume was more than offset by lower refi volume which is expected to continue of note our purchaserelated volume was in the quarter compared to the industry at on the comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 other hand activity in several other businesses has begun to pick up including general middle market environmental services commercial real estate entertainment equity fund services and corporate banking as far as ppp average loans decreased a little over million during the quarter however on a periodend basis ppp loans declined nearly billion as the forgiveness process accelerated at the end of the quarter excluding the decline in ppp loans periodend loans were up million due to increases in general middle market environmental services and commercial real estate partly offset by a decrease in dealer total line commitments increased billion with growth in most business lines led by general middle market usage also grew resulting in line utilization holding steady at our pipeline increased despite the strong level of commitments closed during the quarter and the portion in the last stage of the pipeline again grew significantly this bodes well for future loan growth loan yields increased basis points including the basis points impact from the lease residual adjustment in the first quarter and basis points from fees including accelerated fees on ppp loan forgiveness all other factors offset each other average deposits increased billion climbing to a new record as shown on slide noninterest bearing deposits accounted for almost of the growth the full quarter benefit of recent fiscal stimulus along with strong cash generation drove the increase with strong deposit growth our loantodeposit ratio decreased to the average cost of interestbearing deposits reached an alltime low of basis points a decrease of basis points from the first quarter and our total funding costs fell to only basis points slide provides details on our securities portfolio during the quarter we purchased approximately billion of mbs to replace about billion in mbs repayments and million in treasury maturities as well as continue to deploy some of our excess liquidity the net result was about a million increase in the portfolio at period end and a slightly higher proportion of mbs by increasing the size of the mbs portfolio by over billion since yearend we have been able to mitigate the rate headwind and maintain approximately the same level of securities income mbs purchases in the second quarter had average durations of six to seven years and yields of about basis points this compared to securities rolling off at to basis points which resulted in a decline in the portfolio yield of our goal is to continue offsetting the pressure from lower reinvestment yields by gradually and opportunistically increasing the portfolio size turning to slide net interest income increased million including the million in lease residual adjustments recorded in the first quarter the net interest margin was stable as the impact from the lease residual adjustments was offset by the large increase in excess liquidity as far as the details interest income on loans increased million and added basis points to the net interest margin this was primarily due to the lease residual adjustments one additional day in the quarter added million and fees primarily ppprelated added million and basis point to the margin lower loan balances had a million impact and lower libor and nonaccrual interest recovery each had a million impact the benefit from a modestly larger securities portfolio was mostly offset by the lower securities yields average balances to the fed increased over billion which added billion and had an basis point negative impact in the margin fed deposits remained extraordinarily high at nearly billion and weigh heavily in the comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 margin with the gross impact of approximately basis points continued prudent management of deposit pricing added million and basis point to the margin product quality was very strong as shown on slide net recoveries of million were comprised of a decrease in gross chargeoffs to only million combined with a relatively high level of recoveries of million nonperforming assets decreased slightly and remained low at basis points of loans also criticized loans declined in nearly every business line and are now close to prepandemic levels strong credit metrics combined with our growing confidence in sustainable economic growth resulted in a decrease in our allowance for credit losses of note the social distancingrelated segments continue to perform better than we expected also with help from an increase in oil prices the energy portfolio had significant decreases in nonaccrual and criticized loans as well as net recoveries of million however we continue to apply a more severe economic forecast to both of these areas our total reserve ratio is very healthy at or including ppp loans noninterest income increased million or as outlined on slide continuing the positive trend weve seen over the last five quarters card fees increased million and are higher than a year ago primarily due to government card and to a lesser extent also merchant consumer and commercial card activity these have all been spurred by economic stimulus changes in customer behavior as well as new and expanded customer relationships commercial lending fees increased million to the highest level weve seen in over five years primarily driven by an increase in syndication fees fiduciary income set a record with a million increase mainly due to annual tax service fees a full quarter benefit of the trust advisory business we acquired in march as well as equity market performance deferred comp asset returns were million a million increase over the first quarter and are offsetting noninterest expenses partly offsetting these increases derivative income decreased million as there is a million benefit from a change in the credit valuation adjustment compared to the million benefit in the first quarter aside from this change underlying derivative activity remains robust following strong performance in the first quarter warrant income decreased million and boli declined million in summary we are pleased with another strong quarter for fee income as shown on slide expenses were up million in the quarter the primary drivers were a million increase in outside processing in line with higher revenue and elevated litigation costs related to pending resolution of certain legal matters also we had a seasonal increase in advertising and higher operational losses which returned to a more normal level salaries and benefits decreased million mainly due to annual stock compensation and payroll taxes resetting in the first quarter providing a partial offset was an increase in performancebased incentives annual merit techrelated labor as well as deferred comp we continue to demonstrate that we are committed to maintaining our strong expense discipline as we invest for the future slide provides details on capital management with our cet1 sitting well above our target we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program for million at the end of april we also repurchased an additional million of shares in june our cet1 ratio decreased to an estimated and our goal is to continue to make strides towards our cet1 target of while carefully watching loan growth trends and capital generation in addition we have maintained a very competitive dividend yield which is currently yielding about comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 slide provides our outlook for the expected trends for the second half of the year relative to the second quarter excluding ppp loans we expect loan growth in most businesses led by middle market as a result of increasing working capital and capex needs this is supported by our robust pipeline and expectations that the economy will continue to grow of note we believe mortgage banker will decline modestly due to lower refi volumes and seasonality in addition we believe national dealer is close to a bottom as auto inventory levels are expected to start to rebound as we get closer to yearend as far as ppp loans it is difficult to predict however we expect loan forgiveness will continue to pick up and the bulk should be repaid by yearend we expect average deposits to remain strong customers continue to maintain excess balances however at some point we believe they will start to put the cash to work we expect net interest income to benefit from loan growth excluding ppp and additional days however we believe this will be more than offset by the anticipated decrease in ppp loans credit quality is expected to remain strong assuming the economy remains on the current path we believe the allowance should continue to move towards prepandemic levels we expect customerdriven fee categories to continue to benefit from strong economic conditions along with our focus on attracting and enhancing customer relationships however card fees are expected to decrease as the benefit from growing merchant and corporate volumes could be more than offset by lower government card activity as indiscernible stimulus payments wane in addition in the second quarter there were categories that were also somewhat elevated such as fiduciary due to the second quarter tax preparation fees and deferred comp which is difficult to predict on a yearoveryear basis we expect to see solid growth in the second half we expect expenses to decrease certain line items should be seasonally higher such as occupancy advertising and travel and entertainment in addition as we continue to invest for the future technology investments are expected to rise modestly as they typically do in the second half of the year however more than offsetting these factors we expect second quarter levels of litigationrelated expense and deferred comp will not repeat finally as i indicated on the previous slide we plan to continue share repurchases now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim as i mentioned at the beginning of the call we are seeing many favorable trends including some loan growth momentum in certain business lines including general middle market with strong ism services and manufacturing indices and a record number of job openings business and consumer confidence remains positive in the support of a continued growth in the back half of the year as we continue to navigate this ultralow interest rate environment we are focused on delivering a more diversified and balanced revenue base with an emphasis on fee generation and our progress is demonstrated in a consistent increase in noninterest income over the past five quarters we are investing for the future to ensure we can provide highcaliber products such as our treasury management services comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 in the second quarter comerica became one of the first banks to offer commercial banking customers the ability to send realtime payments in addition business deposit capture now includes the ability to scan images of checks for deposit with a mobile device finally utilizing intelligent automation we improved our integrated receivables offering our expertise and experience continues to help us build and solidify longterm relationships particularly in extraordinary times like these we are uniquely positioned with our nimble asset size large customer deposit funding base and commercial bank weighting complemented by robust retail and wealth management capabilities finally we are committed to maintaining our conservative credit culture strong capital base and expense discipline these key strengths provide the foundation for creating longterm shareholder value thank you for your time and now wed be happy to take your questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of gary tenner with da davidson curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning gary gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co good morning thanks for taking my questions i wanted just to ask about the loan outlook for the back half of the year i know youre talking about generally more positive and close to bottom on dealer floor plan about the energy segment in particular its like ep balances kind of stabilized this quarter after a decline last quarter how are you thinking about that segment now given the increase in commodity prices peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc gary its peter and appreciate the question yeah we are still an energy bank and over the years youve seen our portfolio weve migrated away from the services business still in midstream still in ep we are seeing opportunities but were being very selective about what we do the underwriting is probably more conservative than it was in years past i dont know that i would tell you what commodity prices have done lately has necessarily made us dive into it more weve seen improvement in the credit portfolio which is really good and so i think were going to continue to have opportunities there i do feel like the headwind weve seen over the last few years of balances dropping is slowing so encouraged were encouraged by that and feel like its a space were going to continue to be able to be able to successful at gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay i appreciate that and then just a followup if i could on kind of expectations for liquidity deployment back half of the year obviously that influx of deposits continues quite a bit and the net increase in the securities comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 portfolio was fairly modest for the quarter so even with your commentary about expectations that customers started to use those deposits at some point it seems like youve got plenty of excess liquidity that you could put to work and im just thinking about how youre viewing that going forward james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc good morning gary its jim thanks for the question first starting with second quarter youre right and it may have looked on the surface like a modest increase in our securities portfolio so there is a lot of wood to chop in the second quarter we did have million of what ill call lumpy treasury maturities up and beyond the almost billion of mbs so we feel we were very busy on the securities front even in the second quarter going after good quality securities just to get the average up to million or the purchases up so we feel like we have some good momentum in the second quarter our plan for the second half of the year is of course to replace the mbs maturities as we always do we do have million of treasury maturities in the third quarter and another dose in the fourth quarter and we outlined these on slide in the appendix and so we plan on replacing not only the mbs maturities but also those lumpy treasury maturities and then we plan on also to find some modest additional amount above that to offset the rate pressures in the securities portfolio but having said that we certainly have a lot of excess liquidity to deploy and we are deploying some of it as we did in the second quarter at the same time if you look at what the market is doing right now were not sure if we want to rush in to that and dramatically increase the size of the portfolio given all the maturities and given the mbs were putting on to replace them so we will continue to make steady progress in deploying the excess liquidity making sure that were going forward on the overall securities balance as well as offsetting any rate pressures but i wouldnt look for the excess liquidity to take a massive dive in the next quarter or two we want to be very measured about how we increase the securities portfolio gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co great thank you operator your next question will come from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi great good morning thanks for taking my question maybe just starting off in terms of fee income obviously a very strong quarter but it does seem that from your guidance that some of that is sort of unusual in nature i think you mentioned like the tax prep and fiduciary and something in card as well can you just quantify how much was lets just say unusual in this quarter that needs to reverse going into or the back half james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 yeah ken its jim yeah ill be happy to answer that we have been very strong in noninterest income not just in this quarter but if you look at the slides on page the numbers and the trend we have gradually been increasing every quarter for the last five quarters and ill remind everyone that our run rate for noninterest income prior to the pandemic was about billion a year which we hit in the third quarter of as we came back in the recovery of the pandemic since then we continue to elevate and you see some of the unusual items for the current quarter over on the right side of the slide i dont think were going to slide back to the old billion a year that we used to ran at but we are not going to stay at these current levels either that would be a very dramatic increase in a short period of time so part of these will certainly take a step back from where were at today now i dont think they will go back to pre pandemic levels because weve had a change in customer behavior theres a lot more electronic use of cards and other channels beyond some of the cash usage we used to see and so card fees will probably end up somewhere in between where they started during the pandemic and where theyre at now commercial lending fees obviously are high this quarter one of the highest quarters weve ever seen fiduciary income we will maintain half of that increase you see in this quarter wed have added customers and we did make a small acquisition for a trust advisory business so you will see a portion of that continue deferred comp of million thats the increase but the absolute number of deferred comp was million and we always assume thats zero each quarter and so you do some extraordinary levels of noninterest income currently occurring we will take a small step back but we will not return to the old prepandemic levels either so overall we think going forward were going to show some nice percentage growth on our yearonyear noninterest income if you go back to the base year of ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay all right that is very helpful i guess just in terms of the second question youve mentioned that dealer could be close to a bottom i was just hoping if you could talk a little bit more about that i know you mentioned the rebalance as you get the new inventory coming in in the fall but can you just layer in the supply chain issues and if thats still an issue and if thats still affecting your dealers and how that might affect growth in the back half peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc ken its peter i think the answer to your question is it is still affecting the supply chain is still affecting things youve obviously seen some plant closures in michigan but in talking to our customers were encouraged that were getting to the bottom i dont know that i can tell you exactly when thats to be or when the uptick what month that would occur in but we do feel like the headwind again is going to get slower going into the back half of the year were encouraged at what we think would occur particularly in  going into next year i do think though were talking before we really start to see some improvement in floor plan balances and i think its probably even a little further out ive been asked in the past about getting back to the numbers that you see on slide for example in prior years i think thats probably at least years or years out but we do feel like were reaching the bottom if you will of where the supply chain constraint is for the dealer business and again our dealers continue to perform really really well we are adding customers we feel like we bank the best of the best in the space we had great deposit growth in dealer so its a business that we really comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 really we love we feel like were a leader in and were committed to figuring out a way to support our customers through this ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah operator your next question will come from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning kind of a follow up on that can you touch a little bit more on the general middle market growth and how you think things may have changed relative to quarter ago it feels like were seeing a commercial bank recovery in front of our eyes here but just curious what your thoughts are on it then also can you touch on you mentioned the pipeline of loans in the last stages can you talk a little bit about that as well peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc jon its peter again so let me maybe ill talk about the pipeline part first so what weve continued to say is that our pipeline is above prepandemic levels and i would say candidly well above prepandemic levels of what were seeing of late and when we mentioned the later stages it feels very good about what we feel like the closings are going to look like in the next days to days so when we talk about that were pretty positive that those are going to lead to new commitments and outstandings we had a great commitment quarter in  increases and so were encouraged that that would occur when we tell you guys that the later stages of our pipeline are feeling very very good as far as middle market i would tell you and i think jon to affirm what you said it does feel across the board really really encouraging and in just about all of our geographies many of our verticals we are seeing the pipeline growth were seeing activity pick up michigan had a fantastic quarter followed by texas and then kind of california and i think thats just a little bit indicative of the size of the books in those markets and the number of customers and opportunities but as things start to open up across the country i think youre going to see it unfold pretty quickly and we are seeing it in that middle market space again we had a very good  historically  has been a challenged quarter for us in middle market but we are encouraged this time just based on what were kind of seeing as of the recent quarter end jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thank you for that comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yes jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then maybe one for jim just on the net interest income guidance it feels like things are positive and maybe the margin is bottoming here but this phrase more than offset by the decrease in ppp loans how material is that and really what needs to happen for your net interest income guide to potentially flatten out james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc good thanks jon happy to take that question ill try to boil this down to really the big drivers our net interest income is really going to be driven by loan volume over the coming quarters if you look at deposit pay rates securities for which were going to try to offset any rate pressures with volume our purchase funds theyre all going to be likely very stable from an income standpoint going forward so that takes you right back to loans as the big driver so lets talk about loan and their impact in the net interest income line item as peter was saying exppp we do think were going to get some good loan growth in the second half of the year in our core businesses and so you can do the math on that and that will be a nice pick up to the net interest income however the major headwind will be the ppp volume and the paydowns that occur there that will certainly more than overpower any core growth we get on the other end and just to throw off the numbers here as we disclosed in the package i think on page our quarterly average in the second quarter for ppp was billion and as we disclosed the ending balance at the end of the quarter it was billion so when you look at the third quarter average and what were headed for relative to what were seeing were probably going to end up with the third quarter average thats probably half it could be a little bit less than half of what we saw in the second quarter so thats approaching a billion drop in ppp balances keep in mind those are earning about so thats a pretty significant headwind and then as we move to the fourth quarter youll probably see that ppp balance go in half yet again now putting aside the normal yield which includes amortized fees we think our accelerated fees in the third quarter will likely be around the same million that we saw in the second quarter but its probably going to be about half of that in the fourth quarter and so when you look at those factors just from ppp more than overshadowing whats going on in the core portfolio that will create a headwind now just some smaller items to consider we do some smaller headwinds from swap maturities that we itemized on page that includes the second quarter maturity in june that will have a small impact on  and then ill just say libor indiscernible loan mix competitive pressures all of those things can move it up or down slightly well see where those go but again ill just summarize it as its really going to be a function of loan volume for the most part and to what extent we can offset the ppp average rundown so hopefully that helps jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes that helps thank you very much comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jon operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc ebrahim good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning i guess just the first question on slide jim if you could talk about from an alco standpoint you talked about the duration of the new securities that you bought how are you thinking about and no one knows when we get to a rate hike from the fed but talk to us as we approach a fed rate hike cycle how youre thinking about maintaining asset sensitivity and how we should think about the duration of the securities book leading into that james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc all right ebrahim thank you for the question and by the way welcome to the coverage you know when we look at ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc when we look at our decisioning around securities portfolio on how we grow it and the type of securities we add to it there are a lot of considerations but we think were in a very advantageous position to take advantage of what good rates might be out there for certain types of securities when i look at comerica or asset sensitivity its high and it actually has grown since the end of the year since we added all these securities its mostly a function of deposit growth but there are some other factors also and so we feel like with all the asset sensitivity we have certainly adding securities fixed rate securities is something we can afford to do and we can afford to spend some of that asset sensitivity we did add securities with longer duration over the last couple of quarters but again if you look at our average duration its pretty reasonable and we think its pretty manageable especially when you consider the rest of the complexion of our balance sheet and some of our longterm deposits we consider the fact that we have excess liquidity thats certainly not an issue we can probably afford to do more and then just when you look at the sweet spot out there in terms of whats available swaps really arent a good value right now treasuries not a good value we think given the capacity we have to add some longer duration securities to the balance sheet and the yield that offers its really the right way to go for us and we feel like we can continue to go this direction having said that no one knows where rates are going theres no free lunch out comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 there there could be regret in either direction but we think given the complexion of our balance sheet and our business model this duration is something that we can afford to add to the balance sheet curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jim i might add that as we see rising rates occur which would be a good thing obviously for the banking industry some combination of leveraging our securities portfolio and synthetic hedges would really be our focus at that point and we made good progress on hedging before the pandemic and then obviously rate scaled so dramatically that we really were not able to fully hedge the portfolio but were always going to be an asset sensitive bank but in a rising rate environment wed like to meet some of that asset sensitivity and then secondly i would say just our focus on fee income continues to be a way that were trying to diversify the overall asset sensitivity of the revenue base ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thats helpful and just on a separate based on your response to one of the earlier questions it doesnt sound like youre seeing a big divergence geographically in terms of loan demand midwest versus california versus texas give us a sense of theres been a lot of headlines around this move from california to texas are you actually seeing that in any discernible way when you look at client movement and just demand from your customers peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc ebrahim yeah its peter so yeah but i do feel like our growth that weve seen has been across the country to answer that question and then second we feel like with our geographic footprint were in a great spot to support customers moving from california to texas or texas to michigan or either way i mean i think youre seeing anything else that were seeing on population movement we continue to feel really good about the california economy and the opportunities that are there and so i think the answer to your question is yes we are able to support our customers through that but both markets are really opportunities for us to continue to grow our customer base and our portfolio and were seeing that occur so curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc peter i might just add that maybe just add a comment on california because we do get that question periodically and as peter said were still very bullish on that market i mean its still the sixth largest economy in the world its still a very diverse economy were seeing some positive trends in import export activity travel and leisure there are a number of things where a positive to point to despite some of the challenges that have been very public for the california market ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thats helpful perspective thanks for taking my questions peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc thank you comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 operator your next question will come from the line of john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning just a question on back to the loan growth front on line utilization i know you indicated that it remained steady at around i guess based upon the activity that youre seeing and then youre encouraged by is it fair to assume that you do expect an increase there in drawdowns and can you also help us frame out whats your longer term utilization level that you think is fair to assume and the timing that you believe you can get back to that level thanks peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc john its peter i think were seeing utilization as we mentioned level out i think that well probably see it i hope well see it bounce along there to slightly up as we go forward i dont know that youre going to see a tremendous increase in utilization i mean obviously the big question in the industry is when does this liquidity deposits get used up first versus borrowings occurring second and when is all of that going to occur i think that as you get into the back half of the year youll see a little bit of utilization increase but i think customers are going to do a little of both is what ive said i think theyre going to maintain higher cash balances i think theyll start to use a little more credit i dont think theyre going to swing heavily one way or another just because despite the encouraging outlook across the country all of our customers are more cautious about the future than they have been as we all are so i think the timing of those two things occurring are going to be interesting to unfold but were encouraged by the utilization we saw in  we think that its going to hang in there start to increase a little bit and i think itll probably be in the next year or maybe even further before we get back to normal utilization levels that you might have seen in years past or prepandemic john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thats helpful and then separately on the capital front cet1 ratio of and then your internal target that was around you reiterated at around we are seeing some regional peers begin to nudge down their internal target can you just talk about that potential if there is any likelihood of being able to move that target lower over time thanks james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 great john its jim happy to take that question for now we are comfortable with that target were always observing the environment and just taking note of whats going on both on the regulatory front and just the overall economy but right now we are comfortable with the were always in tune with some of our key constituents such as regulators and rating agencies to make sure that were properly positioning our capital having said that we will continue to observe whats going on and certainly one of our internal goals is rates go up to take pretty significant steps to smooth out our earnings stream with respect to asset sensitivity we know that we have a very good credit risk profile we would like to improve our earnings stability profile from an asset sensitivity standpoint and i can tell you that once we do that i will feel better about potentially considering and i think our board would too considering going below that may accompany a little bit of a shift in the capital stack we may issue some preferred to that time but for now i will say we are comfortable to target john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thats helpful all right thanks for taking my questions operator your next question will come from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning hey thanks for taking the questions i just wanted to ask on the reserve and so what you guys consider the steady state once we complete the reserve drawdowns is the plan to level it out at the pre pandemic cecl day one reserve or just given the improving macroeconomic backdrop is there an opportunity to take it down below that level in you guys eyes melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah scott this is melinda thanks for the question obviously first and foremost cecl is really a complex accounting exercise that we go through every single quarter based on what the economic forecast is at that time as well as how our portfolio is performing as jim mentioned in his comments we do expect based on the performance the strong performance of the credit portfolio and what we believe to be the economic forecast at this time that were going to continue to see reserve levels moderating down to a prepandemic level for day one cecl day one cecl was about were at about right now so its reasonable to assume that well continue to trend downward over the course of the next couple of quarters given the fact that cecl is new i dont know that anybody really knows where the bottom of cecl is but i do think its possible that we could see reserve levels fall slightly below that day one cecl number r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thats excellent color thank you and then wanted to revisit the floor plan business for just a second and see if you guys have any updated thoughts on what you consider sort of the normal level for that business i think historically you bounced around sort of the billion to billion level but just given sort of comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 how dealers have adapted to inventory world or adapted to a low inventory world do any of your customers sort of tell you that there is some middle ground where there is like a net benefit to having lower inventory levels than theyve carried in the past peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc scott its peter yeah i think the dealers would tell you that theyre having as much profitability as theyve ever had and these lower inventory levels for them actually work pretty well for the dealership the question really is about the industry in general and what do the oems do at the end of the day and our belief is that when we get to the other side of this it would be back to normal and back to normal i dont know i think thats probably debatable amongst in the industry as you see on slide i mean youre right our balances have been in the billion to billion range for a long long time and in particular floor plan has been billion higher than what its running today we think well get back to that i dont know if well get all the way back to it but we definitely think in the coming years that well get pretty close to it and again i think that comes back to when does normalization hit the space and we believe based on the conversations that were having that that will happen its just a question of timing and so thats why we feel that way r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right thats perfect thank you guys very much peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yes thanks scott operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning good morning everyone i wanted to start so if we look at the million of general middle market loan growth that you saw in the quarter did you see those companies draw down their deposit balances prior to drawing on credit lines or are they drawing on lines concurrent with deposit balances being highly elevated peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc steven its peter id say its a little more of the latter that you said i think that they are borrowing in conjunction with still having the deposit balances so i believe middle market loans in general still grew so back to what i was kind of saying a little bit earlier i think that some of this is a timing issue i think youve got an optimistic encouraged economic environment but cautious leadership of middle market companies that want to make sure comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 that theyve got liquidity for whatever comes so theyre comfortable borrowing some more money but they still want to have cash in the bank and candidly thats why our credit quality looks so good so i think that as we sit today i would answer you that it feels like theyre borrowing more money but still maintaining cash balances and back to i would tell you utilization a little bit back to this question even though it was flat for the company it was up a little bit in middle market steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you okay and then thank you ph well you are seeing new loan opportunities right every bank is in the same boat you guys are with a low loantodeposit ratio is the competitive environment i imagine its significantly more intense is it primarily rate or are you starting to see structure enter in terms of companies trying to win away from you guys peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah steven i continue to feel like its primarily rate i think the banks for the most part continue to be really really responsible on credit structures so the most competitive piece of it right now does seem to be rate steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then if i could squeeze one more and just final on the environmental services business it actually saw a nice growth this quarter right thats been flat for most of the past year is this a onetime bump or should we be expecting this to be a more significant contributor to loan growth each quarter thanks peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc i know im expecting it to be a more significant contributor to loan growth steven so we think this is a great business for us we feel like we are a leader in this weve talked about dealer mortgage energy there are tls theres a number of businesses that we stand out in esg is another one where we are really encouraged by the opportunities were seeing were adding talent to this space were exploring lots of different avenues that we can do in esg including renewables solar opportunities so were encouraged thats why we have a slide in here this quarter and so we believe its an opportunity for us to continue to grow this business steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for talking my questions curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks steven operator your next question will come from the line of ken usdin with jefferies curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 good morning ken kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning everyone just a follow up on the capital return question you used a good good basis points of cet1 with the combination of the riskweighted asset inflation and the big buyback im just wondering as you go forward and expect better loan growth which would imply continued if not faster rwa growth how does the buyback ph fit against that in terms of the magnitude it would seem that you could get to your pretty close without even doing much buybacks so just wondering the balancing act between the two thanks james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc hey ken good morning its jim yeah youre exactly right we expect earnings to continue to be strong the dividend of course is already strong but we are expecting as we saw it into the second quarter we are expecting continued good core loan growth and so that will make us far less reliant on share repurchases in the third and fourth quarter and i would certainly expect our share repurchase dollar amount to be far less than what we saw pacewise in the second quarter so yeah that will be a we will be winding down probably the absolute amounts of that tool as loan growth services step in and it can become essentially a very productive use of our capital kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then just on you made a point earlier about balancing out your asset sensitivity and im just wondering if you can elaborate on that a little bit more visàvis like does it make you think about changing the orientation of the swaps book adding terminating just kind of we have that great layout on but just any page but just any updated thoughts on how you would anticipate doing that as we get closer to the rate cycle thanks james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah ken we are very assetsensitive currently even with all the securities weve added so and we are always going to be asset sensitive to some extent but we do want to reduce that asset sensitivity gradually and probably pick up the pace of reducing it as rates go up over time and so right now we do have excess liquidity we do have the room on the balance sheet the best value right now we feel is adding securities but i think what youll see is as rates go up youll see us start to transition from onbalance sheet tools to more synthetic tools and adding offbalance sheet hedges and offbalance sheet hedges will become probably the primary way we do it once we start seeing rates go up but for right now we think we do have a room in the balance sheet to use cash instruments and youll just see us gradually transition as rates go up over time and we will ultimately reduce a very large amount of the asset sensitivity but now is not the time to do that but at the same time were not going to sit and do nothing either right now so itll be measured over time thats how i would describe it kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 okay and so you havent done anything in terms of changing the look and feel of the off balance sheet book as it stands right now it looks pretty consistent versus where its been james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thats right thats not a tool were going to utilize at this point and we do have some swaps maturing over the next year you could see the overall swap number actually decrease we may be able to offset that with cash instruments but for now we just dont see the value with swap rates being where theyre at right now but certainly it will be our primary tool over time as rates start to go up kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thanks a lot jim james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning it sounds from your earlier comments that there is an appetite among your dealer partners for keeping floor plan levels lower versus history even after the supply chain issues have been resolved from comericas perspective what are your thoughts on the idea that lower floor plan balances wouldnt necessarily be a negative since dealer floor plan loans are risk weighted and theyre relatively low yielding such that you may actually find that its actually accretive to your roes if we did see dealers ph like lower inventory levels in the future can you speak to that thought process peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc bill its peter i dont know if jim wants to add in here but our approach is to make sure were supporting our customers i mean thats the number one focus for us so i your question youre asking is a really big picture one on what does the business look like going forward were going to support them whether theyve got low inventory levels and right now theyve got huge deposits were supporting them with wealth management opportunities finding other ways to take care of our customers in this environment the day will probably come that they will need the floor plan availability because it may candidly be something that gets pushed on them it may not be something that they can necessarily decline and so well be there to support them through that and weve been in this business over years and its been good for the bank the whole time we continue to believe it will be going forward and are very encouraged about what that could look like into the future comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc peter i might add that thats a business where we also have other opportunities you mentioned wealth management but we do a lot of real estate lending for new ad points for dealers and then theres a fair amount of ma activity that we support on the lending side as well so there are other ways that we support the dealerships beyond just the floor plan bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats super helpful if i may just follow up on the point that it may get pushed on them and it may not just be their decision so if the dealer does want to run with less inventory and customers remain willing to as i think weve seen during the pandemic either take whatever inventory is on hand or wait a few months if they want something more specific that willingness is there i guess what are some of the other variables that would lead to sort of that being pushed on them just maybe if you could give a little color on ph what youre looking at peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc well yeah its just the manufacturing of cars i mean the industry historically has been cars are manufactured and theyre sold at the point that it arrives on the dealership so in the past thats the sort of model that you have i dont know that were moving to a completely justintime type environment maybe we are im not attempting to try to predict what that does or doesnt look like but one way or another our job is to support our customers and whatever unfolds there were going to be there to do it dont forget were a huge auto lender in michigan as well so were very comfortable with the auto industry space whether thats on the car manufacturing side the dealer side whatever happens with autonomous driving whatever happens with electric vehicles we feel like were a bank thats able to be a leader in the auto space as it unfolds in the next couple of decades and theres going to be a lot of macro things that happen but we are well positioned to be in the front of that bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats really helpful commentary thank you so much for taking my questions peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 hey great good morning great i want to follow up on kens interest rates and some of the questions asked a little bit differently weve seen some of your peers talk about taking down rate sensitivity as rates go down rates go up and some of them are doing it through purchasing of resi mortgages to add duration and theyre saying thats a better risk adjusted yield than just buying mbs im wondering if thats at all on the table as you kind of consider broader alco strategies thanks james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah good morning chris and welcome to the coverage being a commercial bank were actually quite comfortable with our current approach of buying the mbs securities they carry far less capital that you have to hold on them we feel we have the expertise to manage it and so thats where we choose to put that liquidity is on the mortgagebacked security side and then from a pure business standpoint were comfortable with our current business mix christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and then as a follow up just interested and maybe i missed it in your prepared remarks normalized cash levels obviously theyre pretty high right now and i guess to the degree and timing you expect to hit normalized thanks james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc chris that will be a function of what happens in the economy right now we have incredible fiscal stimulus we have very accommodative monetary policy and that is driving a large amount of excess liquidity the fed will start tapering at some point but taper doesnt mean stop it just means taper and in the meanwhile i just see this fiscal stimulus continuing to occur the economy is running at a very high rate right now and will for some time and that creates a bit of a velocity factor or multiplier which creates deposits in the system and i do see these deposits theyll move around the banking system but i dont see them leaving it to any large extent and so i do see deposits waning a little bit for comerica we do some businesses that are specific to some of the stimulus thats occurred and some of those businesses will lose some of the deposits over time but i think were going to be very flush with deposits for some time to come we will see loan growth start to eat into that but i dont see us getting back in the foreseeable future to the more minimal levels of cash that we were holding prior to the pandemic so it just feels like this environment is here to stay for some time christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks for the color james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of steve moss with b riley securities comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steve steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc hi good morning just on commitments here you guys mentioned another really strong increase for the quarter here i think it was up about in the first quarter just kind of curious as to how strong it was and also just are these from existing customers or new customers peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc steve its peter yeah so the commitments were up on slide billion in the quarter which was a really really good quarter compared to the last five its a little mix of both weve got we typically run on average historically about half and half half new to new half new to existing and id say right now its a little more new to existing but it was a little bit of both and again a very very quarter for commitment increases steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay thats helpful and then in terms of just loan pricing maybe go drilling down a little further on that just kind of curious as to where loan spreads are now versus maybe prior quarters the last couple of quarters or pre pandemic levels peter sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah steve im kind of reluctant to say anything about where loan spreads are i would just tell you that again pricing is more aggressive than it has been historically its definitely the more challenged part on winning business versus credit exposure so i think you can infer from that that loan spreads in general are lower than they historically have been but we dont usually comment about what sort of spreads were seeing steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc all right thank you very much operator your next question will come from the line of jennifer demba with truist securities curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc good morning i think everything has probably been asked but i just wanted to ask you about what youre seeing in terms of competition for talent and wage pressure right now comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc jennifer i think each of us has a perspective around the table here its somewhat of a recent phenomenon but in general i think its fair to say that it has gotten more competitive and more challenging ph the side has really gone through a transformation here it feels like and there are a lot of people not just at comerica but friends family people are making life changes and life choices about how they move forward from the pandemic and thats created a little bit of churn beyond that you just have what we see is a whole bit of wage inflation that might be coming not just our way but in the whole industry and youre seeing this across the whole economy and for us its anecdotal a lot of that is not in the run rate at this point in time but just as we stay in touch with the market it does feel like theres a bit of a challenge there just as other manufacturers and service industries were seeing in terms of getting the talent in for the same price that we used to so it does feel like were going through a little bit of a transition as an economy and thats something were going to have to adjust to curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jim if i might just add this is curt that we feel like we did a really good job of being sensitive to our employees needs throughout the pandemic and being accommodative and supportive financially and otherwise of our employee base and we as a company sort of pride ourselves on having a longer tenured employees and deep relationships with not only customers but employees over time and certainly there is some pressure out there and were trying to stay in front of it in terms of the right benefits in terms of retention where its needed and just in terms of being proactive and communicating and connecting with our employees jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc what has the postpandemic work environment looked like for your employees i mean how many are going to be will be back in the office full time versus flexible versus totally remote curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jennifer we are about this is curt again we are about halfway maybe more than halfway through our return to office planning we our execution will have be completing that in sort of the augustseptember timeframe unless something significantly changes we all are dealing with this sort of this covid resurgence and variants etcetera but assuming that is manageable that is our plan right now and what we are focused on or what weve been saying is that the majority of our employees will be in the office the majority of the time but that does not mean that everyone will be here five days a week we will certainly have employees who are here five days a week but we will have employees where were providing more flexibility really depending upon the job and the employees needs as well so well have some that are working three days in the office two days at home or four days in the office one day at home those types of things we will have very few employees that are working completely remotely and i think thats important just from the standpoint of maintaining our culture our environment apprenticeship development of employees the collaboration amongst our employees etcetera jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2021 operator ill now turn the call back over to curt farmer president and ceo for any concluding remarks curtis chatman farmer chairman
