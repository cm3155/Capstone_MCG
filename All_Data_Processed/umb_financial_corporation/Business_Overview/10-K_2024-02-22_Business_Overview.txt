supply of reserve balances in order to achieve targeted federal funds rates or to put pressure on longerterm interest rates in order to achieve more desirable levels of economic activity and job creation the discount rate charged on loans by the federal reserve banks the level of reserves required to be held by depository institutions against specified deposit liabilities the interest paid or

judicial or administrative interpretations of those laws and regulations and other laws and regulations that affect the company overview the company is a bank holding company under the bhca and a financial holding company under the glba as a result the companyincluding all of its businesses and operationsis subject to the regulation supervision and examination of the frb and to restrictions on permissible activities this framework of regulation supervision and examination is intended primarily for the protection and benefit of depositors and other customers of the bank the deposit insurance fund the dif of the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic the banking and financial systems as a whole and the broader economy not for the protection or benefit of the companys shareholders or its nondeposit creditors many of the companys subsidiaries are also subject to separate or related forms of regulation supervision and examination including the bank by the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ under the national banking acts the fdic under the federal deposit insurance act the fdia and the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act umbfs umb distribution services llc and umb financial services inc by the securities and exchange commission the sec and state regulatory authorities under federal and state securities laws and umb distribution services llc and umb financial services inc by the financial industry regulatory authority finra and umb insurance inc by state regulatory authorities under applicable state insurance laws these regulatory schemes like those overseen by the frb are designed to protect public or private interests that often are not aligned with those of the companys shareholders or nondeposit creditors the frb possesses extensive authorities and powers to regulate the conduct of the companys businesses and operations if the frb were to take the position that the company or any of its subsidiaries have violated any law or commitment or engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice formal or informal corrective or enforcement actions could be taken by the frb against the company its subsidiaries and institutionaffiliated parties such as directors officers and agents these enforcement actions could include an imposition of civil monetary penalties and could directly affect not only the company its subsidiaries and institutionaffiliated parties but also the companys counterparties shareholders and creditors and its commitments arrangements or other dealings with them the occ has similarly expansive authorities and powers over the bank and its subsidiaries as does the cfpb over matters involving consumer financial laws the sec finra and other domestic or foreign government authorities also have an array of means at their disposal to regulate and enforce matters within their jurisdiction that could impact the companys businesses and operations restrictions on permissible activities and corporate matters under the bhca bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and to closely related activities that are incidental to banking as a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company under the glba the company is also abledirectly or indirectly through its subsidiariesto engage in activities that are financial in nature that are incidental to a financial activity or that are complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally activities that are financial in nature include underwriting dealing in or making a market in securities providing financial investment or economic advisory services underwriting insurance and merchant banking the companys ability to directly or indirectly engage in these banking and financial activities however is subject to conditions and other limits imposed by law or the frb and in some cases requires the approval of the frb or other government authorities these conditions or other limits may arise due to the particular type of activity or in other cases may apply to the companys business more generally examples of the former are the substantial restrictions on the timing amount form substance interconnectedness and management of the companys merchant banking investments an example of the latter is a condition that in order for the company to engage in broader financial activities its depository institutions must remain well capitalized and well managed under applicable banking laws and must receive at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act cra under amendments to the bhca promulgated by the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of and the doddfrank act the company may acquire banks outside of its home state of missouri subject to specified limits and may establish new branches in other states to the same extent as banks chartered in those states under the bhca however the company must procure the prior approval of the frb and possibly other government authorities to directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of five percent or more of any class of voting securities of or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated bank savings association or bank holding company in deciding whether to approve any acquisition or branch the frb the occ and other government authorities will consider public or private interests that may not be aligned with those of the companys shareholders or nondeposit creditors the frb also has the power to require the company to divest any depository institution that cannot maintain its well capitalized or well managed status the frb maintains a targeted policy that requires a bank holding company to inform and consult with the staff of the frb sufficiently in advance of declaring and paying a dividend that could raise safety and soundness concerns for example a dividend that exceeds earnings in the period for which the dividend is being paid redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction as of the end of the quarter in the amount of those equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred requirements affecting the relationships among the company its subsidiaries and other affiliates the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank umbfs and its other subsidiaries but receives the vast majority of its revenue in the form of dividends from those subsidiaries without the approval of the occ however dividends payable by the bank in any calendar year may not exceed the lesser of the current years net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years and undivided profits in addition under the basel iii capitaladequacy standards described below under the heading capitaladequacy standards the bank is currently required to maintain a capital conservation buffer in excess of its minimum riskbased capital ratios and will be restricted in declaring and paying dividends whenever the buffer is breached the authorities and powers of the frb the occ and other government authorities to prevent any unsafe or unsound practice also could be employed to further limit the dividends that the bank or the companys other subsidiaries may declare and pay to the company the doddfrank act requires a bank holding company like the company to serve as a source of financial strength for its depositoryinstitution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries in circumstances when the company might not otherwise elect to do so the functional regulator of any nonbank subsidiary of the company however may prevent that subsidiary from directly or indirectly contributing its financial support and if that were to preclude the company from serving as an adequate source of financial strength the frb may instead require the divestiture of depositoryinstitution subsidiaries and impose operating restrictions pending such a divestiture a number of laws principally sections and of the federal reserve act the fra and the frbs regulation w also exist to prevent the company and its nonbank subsidiaries from taking improper advantage of the benefits afforded to the bank as a depository institution including its access to federal deposit insurance and the discount window these laws generally require the bank and its subsidiaries to deal with the company and its nonbank subsidiaries only on market terms and in addition impose restrictions on the bank and its subsidiaries in directly or indirectly extending credit to or engaging in other covered transactions with the company or its nonbank subsidiaries the doddfrank act extended the restrictions to derivatives and securities lending transactions and expanded the restrictions for transactions involving hedge funds or privateequity funds that are owned or sponsored by the company or its nonbank subsidiaries in addition under the volcker rule the company is subject to extensive limits on proprietary trading and on owning or sponsoring hedge funds and privateequity funds the limits on proprietary trading are largely directed toward purchases or sales of financial instruments by a banking entity as principal primarily for the purpose of shortterm resale a benefit from actual or expected shortterm price movements or the realization of shortterm arbitrage profits the limits on owning or sponsoring hedge funds and privateequity funds are designed to ensure that banking entities generally maintain only small positions in managed or advised funds and are not exposed to significant losses arising directly or indirectly from them the volcker rule also provides for increased capital charges quantitative limits rigorous compliance programs and other restrictions on permitted proprietary trading and fund activities including a prohibition on transactions with a covered fund that would constitute a covered transaction under sections and of the fra stress testing and enhanced prudential standards the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act egrrcpa was enacted in may amending requirements previously established in the doddfrank act including stress testing and enhanced prudential standards bank holding companies with assets of less than billion including the company are no longer subject to the requirement to conduct forwardlooking companyrun stress testing including publishing a summary of results the company continues to run internal stress tests as a component of its comprehensive risk management and capital planning process in addition the egrrcpa increased the statutory asset threshold above which the federal reserve is required to apply enhanced prudential standards from billion to billion subject to certain discretion by the federal reserve to apply any enhanced prudential standard requirement to any bank holding company with between billion and billion in total consolidated assets that would otherwise be exempt under egrrcpa the company remains exempt from applying the enhanced prudential standards capitaladequacy standards the frb and the occ have adopted riskbased capital and leverage guidelines that require the capitaltoassets ratios of bank holding companies and national banks respectively to meet specified minimum standards the riskbased capital ratios are based on a banking organizations riskweighted asset amounts rwas which are generally determined under the standardized approach applicable to the company and the bank by assigning onbalancesheet exposures to broad riskweight categories according to the counterparty or if relevant the guarantor or collateral with higher risk weights assigned to categories of exposures perceived as representing greater risk and multiplying offbalancesheet exposures by specified credit conversion factors to calculate credit equivalent amounts and assigning those credit equivalent amounts to the relevant riskweight categories the leverage ratio in contrast is based on an institutions average onbalancesheet exposures alone the capital ratios for the company and the bank as of december are set forth below table start tier leverage ratio tier riskbased capital ratio common equity tier capital ratio total riskbased capital ratio umb financial corporation umb bank na table end these capitaltoassets ratios also play a central role in prompt corrective action pca which is an enforcement framework used by the federal banking agencies to constrain the activities of banking organizations based on their levels of regulatory capital five categories have been established using thresholds for the total riskbased capital ratio the tier riskbased capital ratio the commonequity tier riskbased capital ratio and the leverage ratio well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized while bank holding companies are not subject to the pca framework the frb is empowered to compel a holding company to take measuressuch as the execution of financial or performance guaranteeswhen prompt corrective action is required in connection with one of its depositoryinstitution subsidiaries at december the bank was categorized as well capitalized under the pca framework basel iii including revisions to the global basel iii capital framework commonly known as basel iv includes a number of more rigorous provisions applicable only to banking organizations that are larger or more internationally active than the company and the bank these include for example a supplementary leverage ratio incorporating offbalancesheet exposures a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio these standards may be informally applied or considered by the frb and the occ in their regulation supervision and examination of the company and the bank deposit insurance and related matters the deposits of the bank are insured by the fdic in the standard insurance amount of thousand per depositor for each account ownership category this insurance is funded through assessments on the bank and other insured depository institutions under the doddfrank act each institutions assessment base is determined based on its average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity and there is a scorecard method for calculating assessments that combines camels an acronym that refers to the five components of a banks condition that are addressed capital adequacy asset quality management earnings and liquidity ratings and specified forwardlooking financial measures to determine each institutions risk to the dif the doddfrank act also requires the fdic in setting assessments to offset the effect of increasing its reserve for the dif on institutions with consolidated assets of less than billion the result of this revised approach to depositinsurance assessments is generally an increase in costs on an absolute or relative basis for institutions with consolidated assets of billion or more if an insured depository institution such as the bank were to become insolvent or if other specified events were to occur relating to its financial condition or the propriety of its actions the fdic may be appointed as conservator or receiver for the institution in that capacity the fdic would have the power to transfer assets and liabilities of the institution to another person or entity without the approval of the institutions creditors require that its claims process be followed and to enforce statutory or other limits on damages claimed by the institutions creditors enforce the institutions contracts or leases according to their terms repudiate or disaffirm the institutions contracts or leases seek to reclaim recover or recharacterize transfers of the institutions assets or to exercise control over assets in which the institution may claim an interest enforce statutory or other injunctions and exercise a wide range of other rights powers and authorities including those that could impair the rights and interests of all or some of the institutions creditors in addition the administrative expenses of the conservator or receiver could be afforded priority over all or some of the claims of the institutions creditors and under the fdia the claims of depositors including the fdic as subrogee of depositors would enjoy priority over the claims of the institutions unsecured creditors the fdia also provides that an insured depository institution can be held liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with another commonly controlled insured depository institution that is in default or in danger of default this crossguarantee liability is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the institutions holding company and its affiliates other regulatory and supervisory matters as a public company the company is subject to the securities act of as amended the securities act the securities exchange act of as amended the exchange act the sarbanesoxley act of and other federal and state securities

suspicious activity reporting as well as knowyourcustomer and duediligence rules under the cra the bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its local communitiesincluding low and moderateincome neighborhoodsconsistent with safe and sound banking practices the cra does not create specific lending programs but does establish the framework and

other specified applications that the company or the bank may submit from time to time the bank is subject as well to a vast array of consumerprotection laws such as qualifiedmortgage and other
