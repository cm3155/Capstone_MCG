investorrelationsumbcom now ill turn the call over to mariner kemper umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2022 mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thank you kay and thanks everyone for joining us today in we delivered solid operating and financial results with strong growth on both sides of the balance sheet steady asset quality metrics and continued momentum in our fee businesses when many others in our industry struggled to generate meaningful loan growth we delivered increase in average loans in excluding ppp largely through market share gains were positioned to benefit from the anticipated economic expansion higher interest rates and continued investments were making in while others are predicting growth based on a better economic environment we are confident that well continue to garner more than our fair share of that growth there were a few factors that had outsized impacts on our results in the fourth quarter and the full year we had higher than typical operating expenses largely driven by higher incentive compensation for the strong business performance we experienced along with additional charitable contributions in the quarter additionally we saw some variances in software costs and legal and consulting expenses related to timing of our business investments we estimate that approximately million of the linkedquarter increase in expenses was variable in nature and attributed to timing of spend many of these incremental expenses should reset lower in the first quarter as weve discussed before we remain focused on delivering positive operating leverage across all environments while we continue to invest prudently in our people and platforms on the revenue side in the gain on our investment in tattooed chef and ongoing market related adjustments impacted yearoveryear comparisons ram will share more detail on the various drivers shortly but we expect to generate positive operating leverage in excluding the impact of ppp with or without the benefit of higher interest rates turning to our fourth quarter results net income for the quarter was million or per share pretax preprovision income on an fte basis was million or per share fourth quarter net interest income was million and was relatively flat compared to the third quarter and we saw positive contributions on the fee income side on services total assets under administration have grown nearly from yearend to stand at an impressive billion custody assets crossed the 150billion threshold driven by organic growth in specialty trust and agency solutions we saw increase in new business in and our teams continue to garner industry recognition for service and innovative products in private wealth new asset sales for increased over the prior year and we continue to build out and strengthen our family office offering im looking forward to further momentum as we continue to invest in this business youll see more detail in the line of business updates in the presentation moving to the balance sheet slide is a snapshot of our loan portfolio showing the drivers behind the loan growth i mentioned average loans for the fourth quarter excluding ppp balances increased nearly year overyear and nearly on a linked quarter annualized basis asset quality remained strong with net chargeoffs of basis points for the quarter and basis points for the full year consistent with our outlook and our historical averages average ci loans increased on a linked quarter annualized basis as we continue to deepen penetration in our markets most of our commercial clients are reporting strong pipelines and backlogs across most industries in general these are more positive feelings about the direction of while customers are keeping an eye on umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2022 supply chain and labor issues impacting so many businesses and clients have expressed more interest lately in expansion both organic and through acquisition in our commercial real estate and construction portfolios average balances were impacted by payoffs and by typical cycles as completed projects are converted to term loans sold or refinanced in the secondary market average residential mortgage balances grew from the third quarter an annualized increase of nearly funded mortgage loans for the quarter were million including million in the secondary market in we saw a increase in secondary market mortgages compared to total top line loan production as shown on slide was very strong coming in at billion for the quarter a record level for us payoffs and paydowns were of loans in line with prior quarter many of our recent payoffs have been tied to merger and acquisition activity more clients have been taking advantage of attractive multiples often partnering with private equity firms and family offices at the same time we continue to see financing opportunities coming from some of these same pe firms and family offices while estimating payoffs can be unpredictable we continue to see a robust pipeline with opportunities across all verticals in the first quarter finally earlier in january we pursued and executed the sale of our small acquired factoring portfolio to an alternative financing company ram will discuss the financial impact of the sale of our factoring portfolio in his prepared remarks overall was a solid year like all of us im hopeful were nearing the final phase of this pandemic but no matter what issues we may navigate im proud of our team and the resilience theyve shown in serving our customers and keeping umb moving forward were excited for the opportunities we see ahead of us in now ill turn it over to ram for some additional comments ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thank you mariner net interest income was relatively flat compared to the third quarter at million as the benefit from solid balance sheet growth was partially offset by changes in asset mix lower earning asset yields and reduction in ppp income we amortized million of ppp origination fees into income and the overall ppp contribution to the fourth quarter net interest income was million compared to million last quarter at quarterend our ppp balances stood at million down from million at september approximately million in unamortized fees remained at the end of the year average earning asset yields decreased basis points to due to asset mix changes including increased liquidity and a 297million decline in average ppp balances for the fullyear our factoring portfolio provided approximately million in revenue and had about million in associated costs so the pretax preprovision income impact was approximately million fourth quarter reported net interest margin fell basis points from the third quarter to driven by additional buildup in liquidity levels lower reinvestment rates and core loan mix and repricing the buildup of excess liquidity accounted for approximately basis points of the linked quarter contraction for full year nim was as shown on slide our fed account reverse repo and cash balances now comprise of average earning assets compared to last quarter and just in the fourth quarter of with a blended yield of basis points based on our current expectations for two to three rate hikes in deposit beta is consistent with our experience during the last rate cycle and improved reinvestment rates on our cash flows we expect that our umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2022 reported net interest margin has bottomed out and will likely improve from fourth quarter levels generally in line with the current consensus estimate of while the volatility from ppp loans has subsided our net interest margin and net interest income will continue to be impacted by excess liquidity levels our provision for credit losses for the quarter was million driven almost entirely by our strong loan growth excluding ppp loans our end of period loans increased approximately million from september our allowance to loans excluding ppp balances is compared to at september noninterest income for the fourth quarter was million an increase of million from the third quarter market fluctuations drove a 33million positive variance in the value of our equity investments we currently have approximately  remaining in our tatooed chef position derivative income increased million from the prior quarter and deposit service charges increased million on a linked quarter basis largely related to client conversion fees in our healthcare business and corporate service charges i will note that just about of our deposit service charge line item is related to retail activity other drivers to fee income including growth and both trust and securities processing and bond trading income are shown on slide noninterest expense trends are shown on slide expense levels for the fourth quarter were above our typical run rate and included a linked quarter increase of million in salaries and bonus expense driven by higher expenses related to business growth and positive business performance legal and consulting as well as marketing spend was higher in the fourth quarter and pertained to the timing of such spend software and processing costs increased over the prior quarter and were driven by the implementation of our new and improved private wealth management platform and as mariner mentioned we increased our charitable giving in and in the fourth quarter the other expense line included a 21million linked quarter increase in contributions these yearend gifts to organizations in our markets that support housing needs small business efforts and education pushed our giving above the million mark for the full year looking ahead ill reiterate that we expect to generate positive operating leverage in excluding the impact of ppp with or without the benefit of higher interest rates our effective tax rate was for the fourth quarter and for the full year for the full year we anticipate an approximate to that concludes our prepared remarks and ill now turn it back over to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2022 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question will come from jared shaw of wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning everybody ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc if we can start ram youd said on the margin was that for full year or was that for first quarter ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thats the full year number thats what indiscernible so when i gave guidance related it was relative to the consensus for obviously a lot of factors jared will impact the outlook for margin as i said as you see slide you can see how that has grown just both in magnitude and as a proportion of our earning assets so a lot of factors will play in the margin but at this point based on our outlook for rates to 240ish sounds about right jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right and then its great to see the loan growth this quarter can you give a little color on what youre seeing with the ci utilization rates and then looking at going forward as those begin to normalize what type of benefit could you get from just a more normal utilization rate and then the impact the expected impact of paydowns over the next few quarters do you think that that moderates mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah hey jared its mariner i would say that utilization rates they bop around quite a bit within one or two points one way or the other particularly during covid the period were in is kind of hard to really tell where it should be settling out from third quarter to fourth quarter in for example it went the other way and in this quarter these last two quarters it went up slightly umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2022 so i think this pandemic period is kind of hard to just come up with an adjusted number so its been kind of bopping around so i hesitate to give you what that normalized number should be right now precovid things were bumping around our utilization rate is really around so you do with that what you will but on loan growth and payoffs and paydowns we as we have historically weve given you a good look into the next quarter we try not to do too much guidance beyond the coming quarter and as it relates to the pipeline for the coming quarters it looks strong as it has been looking and i would say that fourth quarter was the best gross production of quarter weve had at almost billion in gross production so were pretty pumped about the trajectory and the successes were having there as far as payoffs and paydowns go i think were running in the range right now high in the fourth quarter i think as long as rates are low as they have been thats going to push cap rates low and the secondary market opportunities will remain strong obviously were all projecting rates to come up that should moderate i think that should moderate the payoffs and paydowns over the over as rates come up well have to see rates coming up theyre still going to be at alltime lows i think the market is going to still be very strong even with rates coming up but it should certainly moderate sales and paydowns jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then just maybe final one for me when we look at the million of expenses that you called out here quarteroverquarter as we go into the first quarter can you give us a little color on what could potentially be staying around what some of the puts and takes are or should we expect that most of that million is able to roll off mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well the way we are thinking about that million is related a good majority of that was related to production and so if we continue to have very strong production youll see you would theoretically see more bonus commission compensation certainly the charitable contributions were elevated based on our success last year so i guess again if we were towards the end of the year if were having great success we would consider giving back to our community at an elevated level like we did last year jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i would add here on the loan growth front i think really what happened in the fourth quarter story line was actually a little muted because of the payoff activity at the end of the third quarter so i think our actual growth story in the fourth quarter is better than it looks based on end of period loans versus of what the averages were because of the starting point from the elevated payoff levels at the end of the third quarter jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2022 operator the next question comes from nathan race of piper sandler please go ahead nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yes hi everyone good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning nathan ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co a question on deposits obviously really significant end of period deposit growth so just curious do you expect those deposits to largely remain on balance sheet as we start this year and just any kind of updated thoughts on just the stickiness of the massive deposit inflows that you guys have seen which obviously can provide a significant benefit as the fed raises shortterm rates with all the liquidity that you guys still have at the have today mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp sure id say its a story of many points here right i mean youve got whats happened over the pandemic and all of the stimulus money thats come in thats one were all all of us as an industry and analyst community are trying to figure out how long that sticks around so thats a part of it then for us specifically in the fourth quarter on into the first quarter as youre well aware we build some public fund dollars and some large institutional dollars kind of yearend activity dollars if you will and that will bleed out over the first quarter we dont know exactly how far down that bleeds out but if history is a good judge it could be million or so over the first quarter on the public funds side that would roll back out ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp nathan this is ram i would say for us like weve said in the past right i would not focus on end of period balances both on the loan side and the deposit side particularly on the deposit side if you look at between september and december our deposit balances end of period increased by billion a lot of it is attributed to what mariner said between public funds and some institutional so we have seen some receding of those deposits so i would focus more on the average side just because again depending on which day the year ends or the quarter ends we should we could see inflow of deposits mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2022 on the loan side we did have some very strong generation activity in the fourth quarter so that as i said in my previous comment the average deal in that case is a little misleading to the upside positive for us which is the opposite of the story for the deposits nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co understood and within that context just thinking about the likely upward increases in deposit cost as the fed raises shortterm rates ram can you just remind us in terms of where the index deposit balances stand on the average balance basis in the fourth quarter and just general expectations for how your deposit betas are likely to traject over the next several quarters relative to what we saw during the previous fed tightening cycle between and ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah in our interest rate analysis that youll see in our 10k we assumed deposit betas that are consistent with what happened last time so i think last time we had a 225basis point increase in shortterm rates and our betas over that period came to about or so at least from that standpoint were assuming very similar beta experience obviously with the excess liquidity in the system theres an argument to be made that this time around we can slow down those deposit cost increases potentially depending on what the market does and competition does and then on your first question about of our funding is indexed to some shortterm interest rate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co and thats a little higher than what we saw maybe three years or so ago i think it was closer to is that correct ram ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp its slightly higher than the last cycle when we left the last cycle correct nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just maybe changing gears one last one for me institutional banking revenue segment particularly fund services posted really impressive revenue growth yearoveryear fund services in particular close to yearoveryear growth in i guess is that growth rate sustainable into this year and i guess how you guys are kind of looking at the various dynamics within institutional banking as you guys kind of forecast that revenue line for mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah ill take the beginning here and if jim wants to add on he can the story is similar to what weve been saying in the last handful of quarters which is theres been a lot of disruption in the fund servicing market a lot of pedriven acquisitions and mergers in that space and that has put a lot of players on the sideline and caused a umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2022 lot of disruption in service and as we have just benefited handsomely from that and that story just continues and i think thats really what i would say about that on top of just the market dynamics of private equity and alternatives as an alternative to the public markets continues to be just a very strong shift i think id call a permanent shift in kind of the market dynamics which is really where we play and were not really a big public equities indiscernible were doing more on the private equity and the alternative side and that really bodes well for us i think long term thats what id say high level jim youd add anything more to that james d rine a president chief executive officerumb bank umb financial corp no i think you nailed it were continuing to differentiate ourselves on service and the results are proof that our model is working nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co thats great mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and then on the rest of the businesses its kind of a similar story the investments weve been making in people and technology are really paying off growth in our wealth business we havent seen a year like that and sometimes the investments weve been making in people we got a really great leader there and having growth in new client assets is really tremendous for us were really excited about that development and the family office is a big part of that the offering and the technology weve invested in there is really driving and helping that whole business corporate trust man that business is on fire we went on the nielsen lead tables we went from number five to number three in volume weve been number three for some time now in a number of issues but we went from five to three in dollar volume and so weve really been gaining share there which is great because to be growing that business environment where the government isnt really spending the way they normally are were continuing to take share so when that stimulus money does come and the government starts spending on a local basis and redoing highways roads sewer systems sidewalks all those kinds of things when that starts flowing again were poised to really take our share there additionally as you look forward as weve talked before fees have been zeroed out for us looking backward because of rate environment it doesnt take much rate movement looking forward for us to pick up fees and jim you might talk about indiscernible look like james d rine a president chief executive officerumb bank umb financial corp well so in our income and brokers and mutual fund income was approximately million in after basis points in rate cuts we were sitting right at around million so it usually takes two to three months after we see an increase in rates for us to see any additional increases in those fees but so well see a benefit in but you should expect to see significant increases assuming we get the rate increases in umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2022 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah so were very excited so the profile for that business is very strong along with the newer business that we have in the aviation trust business which is really poised again thats doing well in this environment well do even better when people are traveling and the world normalizes again so really the profile across the board for institutional and our fee business is very strong our card business led by our commercial card were very excited and the prospects for that again for similar reasons as corporate spending picks up again looking forward we sit at billion in spend at the end of the fourth quarter again in a muted environment so that represents some tailwind for us and then lastly i know you didnt ask this but just thinking about the fee overall fee picture for us on a relative basis were pretty excited about how we are positioned in a rising rate environment to not have to suffer the changes that will come from the mortgage business reducing on our within the business within the industry we dont have a big mortgage business so we dont stand to lose that so our profile going forward remains as strong as it has been without having to deal with the downside pressures of a rate environment increasing nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it thats really great color and just to clarify jim on the fees is it roughly like half of is it roughly like in terms of the quarterly benefit you guys will see after each fed rate hike ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thats too nathan this is ram this is kind of very specific i mean again as jim said the timing of it and we have multiple funds as clients and not all of them have the same cycles to be able to sit here and say what every basis points might mean its tough to predict it for on a full year run rate basis in as jim said thats where youll see the biggest hockey stick in youll certainly see indiscernible based on when the rates go up when the funds give those benefits back to us so its really hard sitting here just to mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah the idea was just to give you a little color on what it looked like before million and by the way that million was based on the amount of business we had in versus the amount of business we have and clients we have going into and going into so theoretically weve got weve got more clients and more customers so that kind of would bode well for the overall volumes so its hard to really tell what it will be though we can tell you what it was right two years ago which was the idea nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it i really appreciate all the color guys i will step back thanks again mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp sure nathan umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2022 operator operator instructions and our next question will come from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp chris you there christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yes sorry about that i was on mute hey ram the question on the rate sensitivity i think in your q you show modestly asset sensitive but not i think it understates it and im interested in the view on could you just remind us what percent of loans were priced within a year the floors any estimate to what nii would benefit like a ballpark for each quarter hike ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp so ill try that and come back at me if i dont answer the question so of our total loans are variable in nature and then about of our total loans have floors on them but it really takes anywhere between 25basis point and 50basis point rate moves for those to be truly variable so thats on the loan side of the equation so youre right our 10q disclosures have a very static approach so theres no growth in balance sheet and one of the things thats missing in that analysis is what happens to our growth related net interest income so obviously you saw that we have loan growth this past year so thats not included in the analysis and not nor is any rotation from the fed account balances today that are earning basis points into loans or investment securities so its a very static way of looking at it the best way i can point to you chris is so if you look at our disclosures for 100basispoint move on an 800plusmillion net interest income run rate we expect benefit in the first year and benefit in the second year so you can kind of do the math on what that means for every 25basis point move christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay and on the indexed deposits just given the structure of your balance sheet i mean how is whats the thought on retaining all these deposits versus remixing the balance a little bit more aggressively mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well i mean theres a lot going on there i mean some of those are contractual and some of them i would call are soft indexed in the sense that theyre bid accounts and we can remove them if we need to etcetera so its kind of a mix its a mixed bag most of our business is relationship based and wed like to keep as much of it as possible and just worry more about what we do with the other categories on the balance sheet such as putting it to work in loans and what we do with the investments umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2022 so were as we always have been were a little more willing maybe than others to take the pain to continue to build the company the value of this franchise is really in our deposits and so we dont really like to play games for ratios we want to build the business for the long haul christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks for that i guess i have two final ones first is on your securities reinvestments the rate you put money to work ticked up from to where are reinvestment yield opportunities today ram ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah it depends on the duration really chris so if i want to stay short of three years i can get if i want to go a little longer close to six years i can get so the range of outcomes they dont again were talking about it live those are the options were looking at in terms of trying to manage our duration trying to manage our interest rate risk so i would say if you look at the next months i think the cash flow roll off is at based on our current yields and based on where the tenure is we can get pretty close to that in terms of our reinvestment again depending on the mix that we do of duration christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yes perfect and then finally the operating i want to come back to the operating leverage comment i think you said exppp with and without rates positive operating leverage could you just speak to just magnitude if we do get the forward curve it would seem like that would widen decent by a decent amount but again im not sure what the assumptions are to reinvest into the business ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp well we dont give specific guidance and weve been saying this or mariner has been saying this for a better part of the three quarters right even before the rate cycle or what the fed has done lately with so our budgeting process always assumes that we want to gain operating leverage we have a lot of investments going in the fee income side and obviously as you can see from the financial results those are bearing fruit so regardless of the environment we want to be able to generate positive and then the ph dues would really come if the rate environment changes dramatically if the fed does basis points for instance instead of basis points or there are four rate hikes in so either way i think were wellpositioned with or without the benefit of rates just to give you a magnitude of this point again i go back to a lot of expenses as you saw in the fourth quarter tend to be variable in nature so if we do well on the revenue side expenses can grow as well christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2022 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp at this scale ultimately this scale with business rate increases and business generation christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you very much ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks chris
