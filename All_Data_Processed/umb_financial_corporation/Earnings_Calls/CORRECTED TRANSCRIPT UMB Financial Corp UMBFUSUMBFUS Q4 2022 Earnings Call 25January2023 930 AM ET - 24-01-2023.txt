brief comments about our quarter and and then turn the call over to ram for a review of our results in more detail before we take your questions our fourth quarter results closed out another record year of earnings driven by strong balance sheet growth solid credit metrics technical difficulty from our differentiated fee income sources net income for the fourth quarter was million or per share for the full year net income was million or per share an increase of compared to operating pretax preprovision eps for the year was per share compared to per share for the prior year net interest income for the fourth quarter increased sequentially this was driven largely by an over billion increase in average loans which is a increase on an annualized basis the impact of rising rates positive asset mix shift and loan fees this was partially negated by an increase in deposit costs largely driven by deposit initiatives to attract newtobank customers particularly in our commercial business additionally we saw some continued market pressures in our ratesensitive institutional business as weve noted in the past our business profile and funding mix is uniquely skewed in favor of commercial and institutional customers these sources experience different place and timing than some of our more retailheavy peers in the repricing environment we are in today cycletodate weve had a beta of on interestbearing deposits and on total deposits our deposit pricing during this cycle is generally aligned with our internal expectations and consistent with what weve been talking about publicly we tend to focus more on total funding costs which considers the benefit of dda balances and the impact of borrowing levels that beta is cycletodate and we benefit on the assets side as well with a cycletodate beta of on loan yields of our loans reprice within the next quarter and in the next months we expect this repricing combined with our outlook for loan growth will continue to drive good growth in net interest income pipelines and sales activity in our fee businesses continue to be strong across the company driving yearover year noninterest income growth notwithstanding some marketrelated variances im excited for the opportunities we see in and beyond updates on our various lines of business are included in our slides and ram will share a few details shortly weve long focused on our goal of positive operating leverage rather than specific revenue and expense levels for the full year of we generated leverage of this continues to be a focus for us and we expect to generate positive operating leverage again in moving to lending the drivers behind our linkedquarter annualized growth and average balances this quarter are on slide total top line loan production as shown on slide remains strong at billion for the quarter bringing full year originations to a record billion payoffs and paydowns represent of loans for the fourth quarter while we and peer banks have seen some slowdown in the sale on refi markets payoffs are hard to predict from quarter to quarter the average for the year was just over in line with our longerterm trends umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 ci lending provided nearly half of our billion of average loan growth for the quarter with balances increasing on a linkedquarter annualized basis commercial demand continues to be strong and were seeing robust activity within our existing customer base line utilization has picked up from last year and was at for the fourth quarter commercial real estate and construction loans posted annualized growth in the fourth quarter predominantly in multifamily and industrial properties construction represented a large portion of new commitments in so well see the additional impact and balances as those loans begin to fund average residential mortgage balances have increased over the fourth quarter of last year despite the impact of rising rate environment our down payment assistance program for the first time homebuyers had more than new applications resulting in million in assistance in looking ahead to the first quarter we see opportunity in our various verticals across the footprint and we expect continued strong growth to kick off credit quality remains excellent net chargeoffs were just basis points of average loans for the fourth quarter and basis points for the full year nonperforming assets comprise a modest basis points of total assets provision for the quarter of million was driven by our continued strong loan growth portfolio metrics and changes in the macroeconomic environment our reserve coverage is now at of total loans back to the balance sheet average total deposit for the quarter increased or on an annualized basis compared to the third quarter our deposit initiatives in commercial banking brought in more than billion during the quarter dda balances remained steady from the last quarter and represent of average deposits compared to in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year the economic data continues to be a paradox with the labor market signaling a soft landing but other indicators like the lei index are signaling a more prolonged recession we have ongoing dialogue with our clients about their business and outlooks and borrowers are generally seeing good pipeline and many are reporting that supply chain issues have mitigated somewhat however caution remains as finding talent to support growth may be a headwind as i mentioned we see good growth opportunities in the first quarter and although we continue to closely monitor early warning indicators were not seeing any broad concerns overall was a very strong year while the unpredictability of the current rate environment is challenging our timetested business model and relationshipsbased culture continues to perform well and were off and running as we start the year with a goal to maintain positive operating leverage regardless of the health and direction of the economy now ill turn it over to ram with some additional comments ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks mariner let me start with some commentary on balance sheet trends with our liquidity profile shown on slide our fed account reverse repo and cash balances rebounded slightly to billion and now comprised of average earning assets with a blended yield of compared to in the third quarter this was driven by our deposit campaigns as well as seasonal inflow of public funds deposits cash flow from our security portfolio continued to help fund loan growth opportunities during the quarter as shown on slide the portfolio rolloff for the fourth quarter was million with a yield of while we purchased million in securities primarily clos with a yield of additionally the portfolio is expected to umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 generate over billion of cash flows in the next months the yield on those securities rolling off is approximately while treasury yields present very attractive reinvestment levels our priority is to fund the opportunities we continue to see in our lending verticals loan yield increased basis points from the third quarter to with the linkedquarter beta of approximately the total cost of deposits including ddas was up from basis points last quarter net interest margin expanded basis points from the third quarter the largest positive nim impacts included approximately basis points from loan repricing loan fees and mix basis points for the benefit of free funds and basis points from reduced liquidity balances and rates offsets included a negative 94basispoint impact related to the cost and mix of interestbearing liabilities as we look ahead there are a lot of variables at play that will impact the trajectory of our net interest margin including the depth and duration of feds tightening cycle outlook for equity markets and that impact on deposits expected disintermediation of dda balances as ecr rates further increase and our own need to generate additional deposits through targeted campaigns to fund loan growth based on our own simulations we expect our first quarter net interest margin to be flat to slightly up from fourth quarter levels additionally we stand to benefit when the fed pauses as the pressures on our indexed deposit book update and asset yields benefit from the current repricing environment and rotation from investment securities as mariner noted while the focus on deposit betas and nim is important we also focus on net interest income growth facilitated primarily by loan growth additionally we typically manage to a loan to deposit ratio limit of in the fourth quarter average deposit growth kept pace with loan growth keeping our ratio steady at just under given our strong loan growth outlook we will continue to focus on deposit and client acquisition across all our lines of businesses back to the income statement total fee income for the quarter was million compared to million for the third quarter we saw some marketrelated declines including a million decrease in companyowned life insurance income along with a decrease in customerrelated derivative income coli income which was just ph in the fourth quarter versus million in the third quarter had a similar offset in deferred compensation expense for the full year the increase in fee income included investment security gains and losses driven largely by the gain on sale of visa class b shares in the second quarter outside of these gains we saw positive results from several businesses including million of additional brokerage fees related to higher and money market revenue share income despite marketrelated compression of in the underlying money market balances compared to year end trust and securities processing income increased yearoveryear and included strong contributions from fund services and corporate trust for the full year we had a decrease of million of coli income with a similar decrease in deferred compensation expense slide shows trends in noninterest expense the linkedquarter increase was primarily driven by an increase of million in processing fees largely software costs related to the ongoing modernization of core umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 systems million in additional marketing and business development expense driven by increased advertising for various campaigns and projects and million of increased charitable giving included in other expense additionally as i mentioned last quarter our amortization expense increase related to the acquisition of hsa deposits completed in the fourth quarter a few items to note for the expense levels going forward as is typical fourth quarter expenses included several timingrelated variances along with some nonrecurring items considering those variances weve put our quarterly starting point closer to the million to million sic million range also keep in mind that first quarter expenses are typically higher due to the seasonal reset of payroll taxes and other benefits expenses the acquisition of hsa deposits will add approximately million of additional amortization expense annually and as previously mentioned the increase in fdic assessment rate takes effect in the first quarter as a reminder we estimate this will have an approximate annual impact of million pretax as mariner noted our focus remains on generating positive operating leverage while prudently investing in our businesses our effective tax rate was for the fourth quarter and for the full year reflecting a smaller portion of income from taxexempt municipal securities along with changes in coli valuations for the full year we anticipate it will be approximately to that concludes our prepared remarks and ill now turn it back over to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question today comes from jared shaw from wells fargo jared please go ahead your line is open q hi this is ph john ro on for jared shaw ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey ph john good morning q good how are you i guess just big picture ph you guys going into a potentially recessionary environment weve heard a few banks talk about maybe tightening the credit box a little bit i guess could you just talk about if youre thinking about doing anything similar if youre seeing any signs of hesitation or caution from borrowers on the ground mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 ph john thanks for the question this is mariner i would for us for those of you whove followed us for a while we really dont do anything different in any type of environment we stick to our knitting and look for the good quality opportunities and we dont reach during the good times and we dont retract during the tougher times were kind of just stick to what we know and stick to doing how we do it and so thats the backdrop for how were making decisions as it relates to what were hearing and seeing on the ground customers and prospects are still talking cautiously optimistically about the environment for the year revenue projections and conversations seem to still be pretty steady i think the challenge that we hear from our customers really is about the hiring environment but as it relates to selling goods and moving goods everybody seems to be cautiously optimistic about that and as we normally do we give you a little look into what we see for the first quarter and pipeline remained strong for the first quarter q okay great thanks thats a good color and i guess just one other area you closed the hsa acquisition in the fourth quarter could you just talk a little about the outlook for your competitive positioning i guess in that market with some pretty large players kind of dominating at this point james d rine a president chief executive officer umb bank hi this is jim rine we did close the the conversion went extremely well we picked up they have a very successful directtoemployer model and that has been our strategy moving forward backdrop looks good as far as on a national level the government and ph sales entities have been very quiet so we dont anticipate any changes as far as the need for hsas or hsa is going away our pipeline looks extremely strong regarding our competitors were obviously more focused on what were doing but we feel like we have an extremely competitive platform and this will allow us to deliver a better experience throughout our footprint with what the competitors are doing were truly more focused on us but weve been able to compete in this space for a long time and were one of the original pioneers in this space we feel very good about our position going forward and were in the space to stay and were excited about it mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah the only thing id add is the technology platform and the backdrop for the business is really using the rails we have already for all of our other businesses so its a very leverageable business and being a big commercial bank largely thats been largely what we do is directtobusiness model theres a lot of opportunity within our own customer base to continue to grow and its all about the enrollment season and just current customers and new commercial customers adding employees through the enrollment season q okay great thank you thanks for answering my questions ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 ph thanks john operator thank you our next question is from chris mcgratty from kbw chris please go ahead your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great morning ram maybe a question for you just on the balance sheet if im thinking about your comments on loan to deposit you have room there and you can be more selective on deposits but if i look at just the total deposits at the company ph its strong about this year how do i i guess how should we think about just the pace of incremental run off because it feels like youve got roughly billion of cash flow coming off the bond book to fund loan grow im just trying to get a sense of the moving pieces here mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah chris this is mariner a couple of high level comments and if theres more detail you want ram can add some color but i think really what i would focus on we dont really expect runoff we expect rotation and so its really more about what happens to demand deposits we have a very very strong pipeline and ability to grow deposits so we can bring deposits on at market rates and fund growth no problem so really the challenge for us which we think were good at is being disciplined at pricing the assets so as we bring on loan growth as we discussed last quarter our ability to be disciplined on maintaining and slightly growing margin is more important than what the absolute cost of deposits are coming on so were not concerned about that and we feel strongly that we can continue to price appropriately on the asset side to maintain our margin if not grow it slightly i dont know if you want to add anything to that ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp the only thing i would add chris to that is as we said our loantodeposit ratio is now right if you look at the last couple of quarters of loan production and whats happened there is the same pace continues we did see our loan deposit ratio trickle up to close to which were comfortable with as i said in my prepared comments we managed to stay below on the loantodeposit ratio will deposits fund of what we see on the loan growth probably not but thats where the billion dollars of securities that you talked about in terms of outflows comes in so and as mariner said were focused well be focused on making sure we stay liquid on the balance sheet with customer acquisitions christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats really great thanks ram and mariner on the mix of your deposits im looking back precovid you were kind of in the mid noninterestbearing you got as high as youre kind of low now i guess how are you thinking about just internal migration given the competitive alternatives for rates today umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah so i think thats the milliondollar question chris and when you get the answer give us a call so we can plan but i think the conservative way to think about it right is we got down to last time could it get to or something this time probably maybe based on just history thats possible however there are a lot of other things going on from the growth of our customer base in general weve added a lot of small business customers that have a low loantodeposit ratio over the last few years weve got a lot of other initiatives and customer bases our aviation corporate trust business is relatively new and those demand deposit balances have been growing so last cycle we got down to does history repeat itself is the world different is our customer base different were not sure exactly what happens we do believe there will be some rotation from demand this year still to interestbearing were just not sure how much the internal debate we have here because we already saw a lot of that last year is has it already happened right so thats one of the questions that we debate internally is has that shift taken place does everybody who wants to move to higher interestbearing deposits already taken that action we dont really know the answer to that but thats some of the internal debates but to be conservative think about last cycle i suppose christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thats helpful i really appreciate it the last one i would have is just kind of zooming out right if i think about the bullish comment on loan growth call it stable comments on margins it would feel like the net interest income for your company has yet to peak because i think thats a narrative thats going around among bank investors where a lot of your peers are seeing margins and revenues top out i guess would you agree or offer any thoughts on that mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp we expect to see net interest income continue to grow because were a growth company like i said earlier two things we focus on would be net interest income growth based on just growth period as well as growth of the balance sheet and then the other thing we think we can do during this environment is produce operating leverage so were less worried about the absolute expense levels of the company because were investing in our business for growth and then on the other side because we have a long track record of building pipeline we think well continue to grow weve been doing doubledigit loan growth since and theres nothing about our business model that would suggest that we cant continue to do that we have new markets great new markets weve expanded into utah minneapolis texas are three young markets for us that we have fabulous track records in and great people on the ground and were seeing really good traction there and along with all of our other great markets we see the same great opportunities and traction and remember we dont project or predict our loan growth based on whats happening in the gdp anyway our loan growth is based on market share gains so depending on regardless of whats going on economically we think we can continue to deliver the same kind of loan growth that weve been delivering christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 great thank you very much ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks chris operator thank you operator instructions our next question today comes from nathan race from piper sandler nathan please go ahead your line is open nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yep good morning everyone and appreciate you guys taking the questions ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning nate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co a question on just the longer term or perhaps full year margin trajectory over the course of this year as you guys think about what youre paying on incremental deposits outside of the indexed deposits indiscernible do you see some additional margin expansion potential in the back half of this year just given maybe some lagging repricing within the loan book relative to maybe kind of the incremental cost of deposits that you guys are gathering based on some of the initiatives that you guys outlined earlier in the prepared comments assuming the fed pauses all hikes ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah nate this is ram yeah definitely we see some opportunity for margin expansion if the fed does pause and hold right so the pressure on our index deposits as mariner said earlier where we are being disciplined on the loan side and paying market rates on the deposit side that will still be accretive to our margin so thats been our focus so when you think about what happened last cycle the same thing repeated itself where our margin did expand when the fed paused nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great indiscernible ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp and some of the margin benefit expansion also comes from the rotation that we talk about from if you look at the next months cash flows from our securities book that have the exit yield and obviously our loan pricing is much better than that and we pick up yield on that umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got you and within that context i was curious if you guys have the spot rate on deposits at the end of the quarter if you can exclude or isolate the indexed deposits ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp we dont disclose that nate we dont get into that kind of the details nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay fair enough and changing gears ram i think in your prepared comments you mentioned a starting point for expenses in the million to ph million range for the fourth quarter did i get it correctly ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp no million to million nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and within that guidance i mean as you guys think about some additional modernization initiatives that you guys are outlining on the core system side of things or otherwise how does that factor into just overall expense growth for this year in light of the inflationary environment that were seeing for wages and so forth these days mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp so i mean at a high level i mean so the run rate that rams taking about is inclusive of whatever spending were doing to modernize and invest in the business its all in there in that stepoff that hes referring to ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah the stepoff the million that i talked about obviously theres inflation on top of that new contracts are coming up we are making some selective investments and people are in technology and then as i said in the first quarter well have the reset of payroll taxes and other benefits expense and then this obviously less a couple of less salary days so i would expect the trajectory from million for the first quarter to go up just because of the pressure from primarily seasonal increase in expenses nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co sure and as you guys look at criticizedclassified trends across the portfolio obviously nonperformers are pretty negligible amount as we ended the year are you seeing anything across portfolios and youre in discussions with clients that would perhaps cause you guys to come in below your historical chargeoff guidance i think you guys have spoken to around ph to historically umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp when you say below do you mean more losses or do you mean better performance i might ask that question which way youre asking the question nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co i would think that perhaps chargeoffs this year can come in below or better than the historical indiscernible talked about mariner mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well i guess i would suggest that we as has been referenced on the call already its a softer environment and i wouldnt suggest us to were going to do a lot better or anything because for any reason i mean we expect that we can continue to perform the way we have been performing i dont see anything that on the horizon that makes it anything better based on any information thats out there i think we can just keep doing what weve been doing nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great i appreciate you guys taking the questions thanks for the color ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks nate operator thank you this is all the questions we have today so ill now hand back over to the management team for any closing remarks kay gregory senior vice president directorinvestor relations umb financial corp all right well thank you everyone for joining us today the replay will be up on the website
