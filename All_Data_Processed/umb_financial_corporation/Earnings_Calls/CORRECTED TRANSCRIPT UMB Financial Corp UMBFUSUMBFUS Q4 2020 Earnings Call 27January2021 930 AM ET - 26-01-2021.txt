corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2021 now ill turn the call over to mariner kemper mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thank you kay and thanks to everyone for joining us today i hope you and your families are safe and healthy was certainly a year unlike any weve experienced for banks we saw the perfect storm the timing of the implementation of cecl combined with the economic impact of the pandemic including 150basispoint cut in shortterm interest rates and uncharacteristically low longterm interest rates created additional uncertainty and variability across our industry initially we were hopeful that we would see faster resolution but almost a year later the pandemic along with the political and social concerns persist despite all this turmoil the strength of our diversified business model comes to the forefront as evidence with our strong preprovision results we have posted solid asset growth helping drive higher net interest income even as the industry data shows weaker trends in most categories and our strategy to strengthen and build out our varied sources of fee income is paying off operationally its status quo as our systems continue to perform well and most of our associate base remains remote even through the extended period of missing much of the facetoface interaction that is so important to our business our teams are working together and producing solid results im extremely proud of how our associates have adapted during this pandemic ill repeat because its so important doing whats right to support our workforce is a top priority this in turn allows us to maintain our customer relationships and our commitment to high quality underwriting standards and solid capital and liquidity levels we do see some bright spots heading into as our customer sentiment remains cautiously optimistic modified loan balances have dropped significantly and our strong credit metrics are holding steady as youve seen in our press release we had a great fourth quarter with net income of million or per share on page in the deck weve included a highlights table with some key points on several line items pretax pre provision income was million for the fourth quarter and a quick side note about the metric while it helps in comparing industry trends and highlighting earnings power we dont want to lose sight of the tax advantage we enjoy because of the composition of our securities portfolio and the strategic use of the municipal securities pre tax preprovision income on a fully tax equivalent basis was million showing that tax benefit of million the biggest driver of our outperformance for the quarter was the million gain on our investment and tattooed chef that we discussed last quarter this investment is a testament to the variety of capabilities that we have in our capital finance division and we look forward to partnering with our other clients as opportunities arise in the future growing fee income including opportunistically adding income sources remains a key part of our strategy a couple of competitive advantages we have are our lack of reliance on consumer service charges or on mortgage gain on sale income where margins have likely peaked in no one knows for sure how long the refinance wave will last for the industry however weve capitalized on an opportunity we saw to add new customers through our mortgage platform particularly in our private banking business weve shared in prior quarters about our investment in the retail business which includes ramping up our mortgage capabilities weve had a great success in the early stages of our growth building out our retail and private wealth offering as evidenced by our increase in average residential mortgage loans from the year umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2021 ago quarter which are included in our consumer real estate line on the balance sheet on balance sheet mortgages contributed of the yearoveryear growth in average loans excluding ppp on the expense side with a few items in the fourth quarter that are not expected to repeat including approximately million in operating losses and other expenses from a few unrelated matters such as litigation settlements and some fraud losses after the initial lull during the early days of the pandemic we took a proactive approach in the fourth quarter to opportunistically resolve some outstanding matters that otherwise might have taken place in future quarters resulting in favorable and expeditious outcomes while most of these matters are typical to our business the timing and impact of these were outsized in the fourth quarter in addition salary and benefit expense increased from the third quarter driven by higher incentive compensation accruals based on company and line of business performance as well as a million increase in deferred compensation expense as we shared in prior quarters this was offset by a similar increase in income from companyowned life insurance designed as a hedge to the market fluctuation finally we made million an additional charitable contributions in the fourth quarter excluding items that we do not expect to reoccur in the normal course of business our quarterly expenses were consistent with prior fourth quarter levels on the credit front nonperforming loans improved from the third quarter to of loans net chargeoffs were just basis points for the fourth quarter and basis points for the full year of better than our longterm averages i continue to be very proud of our credit performance in fact since annual net chargeoffs to loans have averaged basis points was our best year since when average loan balances were roughly half of what they are today the loan risk profile table on slide in the asset quality section shows the quality of our portfolio and contains the detail on the remaining modified loans by category on the following slide youll see that weve seen a reduction of in those balances compared to june at december loan modification balances had dropped to million or of loans down from and in the prior two quarters respectively we took a prudent and conservative approach to our reserve build in the prior quarters of and our fourth quarter provision was million reflecting the quality of our loan book the nearly million increase in nonppp loan balances and the reduction in modified loans our quarterly provision represents times net chargeoffs of just million we believe a negative provision may be imprudent given the still uncertain operating environment however the impact of more stimulus improved macroeconomic forecasts and the continued improvement in asset quality within our portfolio may make it untenable for us to leave our reserve coverage at current levels in the near future the modest addition in the fourth quarter brings our total allowance for credit losses on loans to ph million at yearend with an allowance to loan coverage of excluding ppp loans that coverage is or nearly times what it was at yearend prior to the adoption of cecl average loans excluding ppp balances increased on a linked quarter annualized basis led by consumer real estate which was boosted by the low interest rate environment and the work weve done to build our business that i mentioned earlier loan production is typically strong in the fourth quarter and that continued in with new originations of billion outside of ppp balance changes with payoff and paydowns of loans looking ahead into the first quarter we see a solid pipeline that looks to continue this growth given what we know today and if history is any guide its reasonable to expect there are strong momentum and market opportunities should drive relative outperformance and loan growth and differentiated net interest income growth in the current low interest rate environment commercial line utilization was returning to its historical levels after the spike earlier in the year umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2021 our loan portfolio remains diverse and wellbalanced across several product lines geographies and industries the total composition as shown on slide followed by loan activity during the quarter and breakdowns of our commercial portfolios by asset class id like to point out that the minneapolis area one of our expansion markets now represents of total loans with just over million in balances we look forward to continued penetration there on slide we updated our exposure to sensitive industries as youll see we removed multifamily from this list based on the operating environment and characteristics of our portfolio at umb which is comprised largely of class a properties with solid payment trends loans in the remaining five categories totaled billion or of loans however after our analysis we feel that approximately million or could possibly carry more risk if the crisis is prolonged we are closely monitoring these relationships and have regular communication with these borrowers to wrap up was a challenging year for everyone but for umb it was a testament to our resilience and to our priorities providing unwavering customer service caring for our communities and managing consistently in all operating environments my sincerest gratitude goes out to all the frontline workers across all the essential industries including the umb bankers that have risen to the occasion and the challenge to deliver the unparalleled customer experience which we are known for now ill turn it over to ram for a few additional comments ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning as mariner noted our pretax preprovision results were impacted this quarter by elevated expenses due to operational losses deferred compensation expenses charitable contributions timing of certain invoices and higher incentive accruals tied to company in line of business results those items plus the impact of two additional salary days drove the linked quarter increase in noninterest expense sequentially net interest income increased driven by earning asset growth in both loans and the securities portfolio along with million from the acceleration of ppp loan fees total earning asset yields increased basis points to from the linked quarter due largely to ppp origination fees which helped drive loan yields to for the quarter average total deposits increased on a linked quarter basis and yearoveryear to billion ph dda balances grew by million due to the typical yearend buildup of cash in corporate trust for municipal payments the rampup of public funds and by commercial banking as low rates have more customers leaving balances in dda the total cost of deposits including free funds was basis points down from basis points in the third quarter both net interest spread and net interest margin expanded by basis points from the third quarter fourth quarter margin benefited basis points from the acceleration of ppp origination fees and basis points from deposit mix and rate changes these were offset by the continued impacts of excess liquidity and lower reinvestment rates on cash flows from our bond portfolio excluding the benefit of ppp acceleration this quarter core net interest margin would have compressed approximately basis points looking forward the actual trajectory of our net interest margin will depend on multiple factors including shortterm and longterm interest rates prepayment speeds on agency mortgage backed securities excess liquidity in the economy and the pace of ppp forgiveness umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2021 given what we know now we expect some additional margin compression relative to the reported net interest margin in calendar year roughly in line with the current consensus outlook of noninterest income was million for the quarter an increase of million of which million was the gain on our tattooed chef investment because these and other market value adjustments will flow through our income statement in future quarters we added a new line item called investment security gains and losses included in that category are also gains or losses on the sale of afs securities as well as on some other equity investments as youll see called out in our slides trading and investment banking income improved on a yearoveryear basis as excess liquidity in the markets and economic uncertainty has driven more funds into bonds additionally you may recall that weve been building out our bond sales team over the past few years adding offices in new york and texas and were starting to see those investments pay off the tax rate was for the quarter and for the full year for we anticipate it will be approximately to we continue to maintain strong capital ratios with our total riskbased capital at cet1 ratio at and leverage ratio at tangible common equity to assets was trends in our capital ratios are shown on slide our tangible book value per share increased more than during the year to at december for comparison our peers that have reported so far have shown a median increase of that concludes our prepared remarks and ill now turn it back over to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question will come from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch just first mariner if you could just touch upon just a growth outlook i think you had one of the better loan growth performance both for the fourth quarter and full year just talk to us in terms of what we heard from other banks ph says relatively slow first half to half of the year and then some pickup in the back half just talk to us in terms of what your expectations are on loan growth and also tied to that as you think what business development on the fee income side is there anything in particular that you see exciting from a growth opportunity standpoint umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2021 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah thank you ebrahim as i said in my prepared comments and as we have historically done weve given a bit of a look into the first quarter which so on the first quarter basis we expect to have the same kind of loan growth via the pipeline that we have had and had in the fourth quarter as it relates to the remainder of the year what i would say is all things remain true that have been true before which is were underpenetrated across our geographic footprint and were underpenetrated vertically on an asset class basis related to a maturity and getting our share within the markets that we do business and then we have again deep pipelines uninterrupted sales activity no reason to expect anything different than what weve been able to produce for many many years related to the underpenetration and really exceptional sales force on the fee income side there are several things that continue to looking good for us our trading and underwriting business both on the public private side and just pure public side continues to look strong as we built out offices in dallas and new york we expect to continue to see benefit from expanding that business over the last couple of years corporate trust one of the most exciting opportunities and yet to be seen yet but it looks as the way that biden is moving pretty quickly an infrastructure bill would be very meaningful to our corporate trusts and public underwriting business as we are one of the major players on a national basis in that space so were excited about seeing that come to fruition we stand ready to be a pretty major player when that does happen fund services continues to be wellpositioned as theres been a lot of consolidation in that business and with consolidation that puts the players that have consolidated kind of on the sideline for a while as potential targets for business development wait to see how that plays out so our pipeline continues to grow there weve had a yearoveryear basis that business has grown nicely on the back half of the year as things progress if the economy continues to go as we all expect it to we expect to see our card business particularly because its a lot of its related to commercial spend we expect that to perform when and if that happens and we agree with the most other banks have said the back half of the year that should be the time we would see that our investor solutions business continues to be strong as we continue to see opportunities with fintechs and our ph wire house and brokerage business remained strong and with the markets being strong the way they are the activity is good there and were investing in our wealth management business weve just invested in a brandnew reporting and trading system and are doing some hiring there pretty excited about that and back to the lending front we also do a two expansion markets which i noted in the conference call minneapolis now represents of our total loans and we just expanded into that market just a year ago so prospects for that are pretty great and weve also moved into salt lake city and have high hopes for that ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch that is helpful mariner thank you and just ram so you talked about margin pressure i was wondering if you could help us just in terms of your thought process around core nii outlook and remind us how much of ppp fees are left that you expect to accrete as these loans are forgiven and sorry if i missed it i joined the call late thank you umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2021 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah so what i said ebrahim on the margin was if you exclude the ppp acceleration that we had in the months of november and december in the fourth quarter our margin would have been down about basis points on a core basis excluding ppp acceleration now just over half of our ppp fees were recognized in so we have call it of those fees from round one of ppps still remaining to be recognized on our income statement and then the core margin i mean as i said in my prepared comments a lot of these will depend on whats happening with excess liquidity with more stimulus coming our way and more programs the industry might be in for longer periods of excess liquidity which will obviously impact net interest margin the other thing is obviously longterm rates as well now with the tenure having crept up a little bit the mortgage rates havent reacted so prepayment speeds and what happens with the reinvestment rates on our mortgagebacked securities book or totally our bond book will also determine the path of margin so thats kind of my thought process mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and i would just add that we also do have round two on ppp so we have to determine how much more we end up doing with that as the doors have open for that business weve been sending applications ph for sba starting last week ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch any sense how big that could be mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp not yet but highly likely to be a lot smaller ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay and just ram to follow up i get what you said on the margin in terms of the core net interest income do you think youve bottomed out or do you still see more pressure on the nii ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp no mariner said in his prepared comments the same comments that he said on loan growth in terms of outperforming a relative outperformance thats still expected to be true for the net interest income side so well certainly grow through the current rate environment which is obviously not very conducive through our balance sheet growth opportunities so those comments that mariner talked about just now also are pertinent to nii ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch understood thank you for taking my questions umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2021 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks ebrahim operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great ph good morning everyone mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc ram maybe start with you on the expenses you called out in the deck i think you called out some items not expected to recur and you talked about a little bit in your prepared remarks im interested kind of what you view is kind of the right jumping off point for for expenses thanks ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah sure chris i mean we dont give any forward guidance like that but ill go back to what mariner said in his prepared comments right if you exclude some of the noise that we talked about in our script the fourth quarter run rate would have been similar to the million or so that we had in the fourth quarter of and so thats a good comparison so a lot of the if we exclude again the noise i would say thatd be probably the run rate that we would jump off from christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and the operational expenses what exactly is that operational loss mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i mean we were not prepared to kind of get into the nuance of it but theyre expenses that would happen normally anyway and we took advantage of to get them behind us and settle things expeditiously in our favor christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and you had the ph gain to do that in this quarter in terms of kind of use of capital going forward i hear you on the organic growth im interested in comments about resuming the buyback which a lot of banks have done and also thoughts on ma thanks umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2021 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp sure these comments though i feel a little stale because theyre similar to what weve said for a long time obviously the first place youd want to use our capital is to build our business so that would be through the investment in people and technology and in ma right ma we continue to look were spending a lot of energy and time so that we which sure like to be able to find something but so the energy is being spent there as far as buybacks and dividend increases outside of what weve historically demonstrated that would just depend on whether were successful investing having opportunities to invest in the business first and then kind of where our stock is trading and how were feeling about that related to market dynamics et cetera so i mean the answer youve obviously seen our history we have done buybacks so were not opposed to them its lower down on the ranking ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp and just add that in the fourth quarter we did buyback about  when our stock was down lower than where its trading now so we will be opportunistic about buybacks and have commenced the resumption or resumed buybacks mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and ram if i could just on the ppp do you have the total accelerated fees or the fees in the quarter and then whats that representing on a dollar basis is going forward ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp we disclosed that the fees the acceleration part is about million incremental to the fourth quarter and most of it happened in the month of november and december previously weve disclosed i think on a billion of ppp loans based on the size of loans and the number of loans we had the average revenue that we expected was about call it so you kind of can do the math based on that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right so of that ph less okay got it thanks operator our next question comes from nathan race with piper jaffray please go ahead nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi guys umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2021 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp ph good morning nate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co a question on credit it looks like most of the items improved in the quarter npls were down chargeoffs were very low deferrals came down to less than but i guess the acl increased a little bit and it looks like those due to portfolio changes so i guess is that just increases in criticized loans and if so what portfolios are driving those increases in criticized ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp nate ill take this first i mean a part of it is the balance sheet growth so if you look at a pointtopoint basis our balances were up about million so when you look at our allowance coverage ratio it actually came down a couple of basis points so thats the primary driver of why we had a reserve build if you will mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah and as far as criticized obviously you wont see that please see the 10q theres nothing nothing will be unusual there and really the most important thing to think about when qs come out is we have very little migration and are criticized from the first category of watch down the doubtful which has been the same case as long as ive been around years nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it thats helpful and then just changing gears a little bit and going back to the growth in deposits in just curious if you guys have any updated thoughts just in terms of the stickiness of that deposit growth entering and whats the plan just from a reinvestment perspective within the securities or just to continue to reinvest cash flows or do you guys kind of ph see yourselves some of that excess liquidity to work in the bond book absent where the growth opportunities are across loans ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp nate i would say all of the above right obviously we are trying to invest it in the market obviously as you heard comments from mariner about the loan pipeline that we see in the first quarter and maybe even into obviously the first choice is to deploy those deposits into loans so well continue to do that and then on the bond portfolio too subject to all the due diligence that we do on municipal securities and what we buy on the mortgagebacked side we continue to see the portfolio grow and then the rest of it is sitting on our balance sheet of the fed account basically as excess liquidity so its going to be a combination of those and i think that will continue into just because of as i mentioned all the stimulus programs and excess liquidity in the economy mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and just as far as the stickiness goes we monitor that pretty closely i think the diversity of our deposit base really makes up for any nuance to whether theres excess liquidity on in particular balance sheets whether it be umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2021 institutional corporate or within the personnel categories i think we feel pretty comfortable that the diversity of our deposit base really cushions us against whatever excess liquidity might be in the system nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay i appreciate the color thank you mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks nate operator our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc just looking at the acl you have great info in there in terms of how youve built that out and about a third of the acl is due to sort of macroeconomic conditions how should we be thinking about that going forward as were starting to see some modest improvement there are you sort of heavily depending on holding under qualitative overlays a little bit longer or should we think like maybe second half of the year youll start reevaluating that excess and we could see that ph really back into the earnings or absorb fee growth mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well ill take a first stab at this and ph if the team wants to jump in and help out here add to as they can at the top of the house related to my comments i already made our thought on that is that the original purpose of the additional provision that we did in the first quarter of last year was tied to the pandemic and as far as im concerned were still smack in the middle of that so its premature to think that we would do some of the releases that others have announced we dont think thats prudent however related to your question about when that would change that would relate to what happens with the vaccine delivery and how quickly everybody gets it whether theres what the stimulus and all the extra government programs do and to your point whether the back half of the year we really feel like were out of this thing or not what id say about just are sort of the algorithm that is tied to that is complex and it includes things like loan growth old years rolling off and whatever performance good or bad was in those years macroeconomics i mean youve got the whole thing in there and we have to kind of live by that algorithm and so as the news gets better in a material way well be hardpressed not to do some sort of release of provision at some point in the year but we have to watch the data and were going to let the data dictate what we do there and make sure we feel real comfortable with it umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2021 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then on expenses if we use a sort of ph million as the base for first quarter and then some of the growth youre talking about i mean should we really is this going to be a year of good positive operating leverage where we should expect to see some decline in the efficiency ratio i guess how should we be thinking about operating leverage mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well i mean improvement for sure but i think where we come out on operating leverage there are some headwinds related to the operating environment the interest rate environment in particular and so i think any meaningful improvement in operating leverage will be hard to get to i mean well be working at it all year long but i think the interest rate environment is a pretty its a pretty heavy wind for all of us as an industry so well be working hard at operating leverage and we may have some nominal improvement in operating leverage but i wouldnt expect in this year to see any meaningful improvement in operating leverage jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator our next question comes from david long with raymond james please go ahead mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning ph david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning ph david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc hey ram the periodending deposits were well above the average in the quarter now i know theres some seasonal impact that you have but looking at the first quarter here how much of that growth and deposits here looks like at the end of the quarter is seasonal versus sticky and how do you expect to defend your nim if you have this excess liquidity ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp so yeah its really tough to look at our quarterend deposit balances particularly as you enter public funds business obviously we have a lot as mariner has talked about we have a lot of diverse businesses that have umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2021 different seasonal aspects associated with it obviously theres growth as well organic growth that were seeing in and then theres the impact of all the excess liquidity in the economy so its really hard to parse it out especially this year but the balance sheet was higher because of public fund season which usually ramps up in november and goes through the february timeline so that happens every year and then in the asset servicing or fund services business theres always some volatility depending on what clients are doing with cash balances in there as well but as mariner said we feel pretty good that all our lines of businesses are provider of funds for us and all the initiatives that weve put in place will help us grow those core deposits so they will be pretty sticky from that standpoint david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it and then reinvestment rates in the securities what are you looking at right now i think you said that the rolloff in the quarter was in the mid180 range ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thats right and the new mortgage backs and municipal depending on the mix can be anywhere from to david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it okay okay and then the second question i had is related to your deferrals and obviously real nice to see those the numbers come down there but the current deferrals if youre still on deferral have those been downgraded and where do they stand in the risk spectrum at this point mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp tom you want to take that thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp yeah its case by case some of those deferrals have been downgraded and typically those have been downgraded to a watch and those would be as you would expect in the hospitality space other ones that may be are on a second deferral we havent necessarily downgraded if were of the opinion that its totally pandemic related and the belief that once we come out of this and the economy gets back to a more normal state that the particular borrower gets back into the position they were in prior to that so its case by case is the broad answer david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks appreciate the color thanks guys mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks dave umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2021 operator operator instructions our next question is a followup from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the followup just want to make sure ive got a couple of things written down right ram the tax rate guide is that a gaap or is that ph fte guide ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thats a gaap tax rate of to christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then the i think you referenced ph margin in your prepared remarks i guess i was interested ph number one do i catch that right and was that a gaap nim or is that excluding the ppp ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp that is on a reported basis so its fully taxable equivalent of ph 270ish which is where your models your consensus models are at so thats on a reported basis that assumes a straight line amortization of the ppp fees so to the extent forgiveness accelerates then you could see some outperformance to that but thats just on a steady state normal amortization of the ppp balances christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and that was the kind of youre ph blocking the for the fullyear is that the right way to hear you that ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp correct christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to kay gregory for any closing remarks mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey kay i might im going to add something here just at the end like because nobody asked about this and no indiscernible i was going to add something real quick which is just that on the ttcf
