call over to mariner kemper umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thank you kay and thanks to everyone for joining us today is off to a great start solid performance in the first quarter included linked quarter annualized growth in average loans and we posted a million provision release reflecting the quality of our loan portfolio additionally we had strong fee income combined with expense levels that moderated from the previous quarter for the first quarter net income was million or per share pretax preprovision income on an fte basis was million or per share first quarter net interest income was relatively flat on a linked quarter basis the positive impact from asset growth and balance sheet moves we made was offset by the sale of our factoring portfolio and the continued runoff of ppp balances along with fewer days in the quarter noninterest income for the quarter totaled million an increase of compared to the fourth quarter ram will share more detail on the various drivers but we saw positives across many of our fee businesses highlighted in the line of business update in our presentation in the current economic and regulatory environment there are a few items that position us well from a fee income perspective first we dont rely on mortgage gain on sale income which is likely to be a drag for some of our peers heading into a rising rate environment second nsf and od fees are a very small portion of our deposit service charges and represent well less than of total revenue and while early weve begun to see a return of fees as interest rates rise for the full year brokerage income where those fees are booked was million as rates fell in subsequent years that total dropped to just million in a normalization of that income stream is a tailwind for us total noninterest expense fell on a linked quarter basis as some of the higher than typical expenses we discussed in the fourth quarter has moderated excluding contributions from ppp we generated positive operating leverage in the first quarter of a on a linked quarter basis and versus first quarter of last year moving to the balance sheet slide is a snapshot of our loan portfolio showing the drivers behind loan growth i mentioned average loans for the first quarter excluding ppp balances increased yearoveryear and more than on a linked quarter annualized basis we saw phenomenal growth in ci balances with balances increasing on a linked quarter annualized basis commercial real estate loan demand is strong particularly in industrial projects although developers are closely monitoring the cost of materials and labor most of our yeartodate activity in real estate has been in our salt lake city kansas city denver and st louis markets average residential mortgage balances grew from the fourth quarter to just over billion as i mentioned we dont rely heavily on mortgage gain on sale revenue however we continue to grow our own portfolio and recently implemented a new down payment assistance program the program launched in december of is geared towards underserved markets and it had new applicants just in the first quarter total top line loan production as shown on slide was again very strong coming in at billion for the quarter payoffs and paydowns were of loans in line with recent quarters while estimating payoffs can be unpredictable we continue to see opportunities across all verticals in the second quarter based on what we see now gross loan production is likely to be stronger than the first quarter umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 asset quality as shown on slide and remain strong with net chargeoffs of basis points for the first quarter consistent with our outlook and our historical averages we did see an increase in nonaccruals from the fourth quarter levels which is largely driven by one relationship at this time we feel like were in a good position there and expect a favorable resolution in the coming weeks as we head into this cycle i look back on prior periods and how our credit metrics have performed the real test of quality comes when conditions are negative back to the balance sheet strong deposit growth continued in the quarter with average balances increasing nearly on a linked quarter annualized basis despite our strong loan growth our average loantodeposit ratio remains low at just for the first quarter this provides us with flexibility in a raising rate environment we have plenty of opportunity to fund growth potential we see in our pipeline yesterday our board approved the quarterly dividend of per share and renewed the standard annual million share repurchase authorization these remain important in our toolkit for capital deployment in addition to our opportunistic ma finally our latest corporate citizen report has just been published and is available on our website it highlights our continued efforts and actions related to environmental social and corporate governance issues our strong first quarter results position us well for the rest of the year and we are encouraged by the activity weve seen so far in the second quarter now ill turn it over to ram ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thank you mariner net interest income was relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter at million the impact of the billion in average earning asset growth was offset by the million reduction in ppp income and fewer days in the quarter we amortized million of ppp origination fees into income and the overall ppp contribution to the first quarter net interest income was just under million compared to million last quarter and million in the first quarter of at quarterend our ppp balances stood at million down from million at december approximately million in unamortized fees remain average earning asset yields decreased basis points to with loan yields impacted by the sale of the factoring book and the million decline in average ppp balances as shown on slide our fed account reverse repo and cash balances moderated slightly and now comprised of average earning assets with a blended yield of basis points compared to basis points in the fourth quarter as this shows liquidity balances still remain elevated from prepandemic levels the increase in average deposits from the fourth quarter was driven by growth in dda balances and the total cost of deposits including free funds remained at basis points first quarter net interest margin fell basis points from the fourth quarter to driven largely by changes in loan mix offset by positive impacts from changes in the afs book the decline in liquidity levels and number of days in the quarter weve added slide in our deck to show the estimated impact of net interest income in various rate scenarios in a rate ramp scenario of plus basis points on a static balance sheet net interest income is predicted to rise in year and in year umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 on the asset side or about billion of average loans are variable rates and of those reprice within months they are tied to shortterm rates with just under tied to libor additionally the securities portfolio is expected to generate nearly billion of cash flow in the next months available to be reinvested at higher rates notwithstanding our strong loan growth our securities portfolio has continued to grow and as we indicated in our press release we transferred securities with a fair value of billion from the afs to htm book in march to help manage tangible capital and reduce the impact of rising rates on our equity at march of our securities portfolio was classified as held to maturity as expected the rate environment drove changes in aoci which declined by million from yearend although fluctuations in aoci dont affect earnings were mindful of the impact on tangible book value and will continue to evaluate potential opportunities to mitigate that impact as youve heard us say before we run our business by focusing on regulatory capital ratios which remain strong with total riskbased capital at cet at and leverage ratio at back to the income statement noninterest income for the first quarter was million an increase of million from the fourth quarter deposit service charges increased million and included a million increase in client transfer and conversion fees in our healthcare business as mariner mentioned nsfod fees included in this line represent less than of our total revenue and came in at just million for the first quarter derivative income increased million from the prior quarter and companyowned life insurance income increased on a linked quarter basis both are included in the other income line and the coli income has a similar offset in deferred compensation expense other drivers to fee income including the million gain on the sale of our factoring business and reduced investment security gains are shown on slide noninterest expense trends are shown on slide a million linked quarter decrease was driven by reductions from the elevated fourth quarter levels in variable costs such as incentive compensation and lower legal consulting and marketing costs these were partially offset by the typical seasonal reset of payroll taxes the increased deferred compensation i mentioned and higher bankcard expense our effective tax rate was for the first quarter for the full year we anticipate it will approximate to that concludes our prepared remarks and now ill turn it back to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question today comes from jared shaw from wells fargo your line is open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is timur braziler filling in for jared mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc starting hey guys maybe just starting on the funding outlook so clearly with a loantodeposit ratio you guys have options im just wondering as you look at the loan pipeline on the optimism that remains there how are you thinking about funding that growth in a rising rate environment are you going to primarily keep utilizing cash to help fund that growth going to utilize some of those securities cash flows or is there an expectation that period end or end of period deposit balances will ramp higher as the year goes on mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yes thanks for the question id say weve got obviously with the loantodeposit ratio and the shortness of our investment book and what we keep at the window weve got lots of flexibility to fund the growth and we can kind of tap what we need to tap timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and i guess as you think about the deposit book and rising rates and deposit betas is that going to be a driver of keeping betas lower for longer how are you thinking about deposit betas in a rising rate environment mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well ram you can take that i mean high level were weve shocked that weve analyzed in some ways to sunday some level we are just going to have to monitor it and a lot of what happens to deposit betas will have to do with what the three or four largest banks do with their deposit rates and well have to follow them we have some index funds about of them are hard indexed and thats going to do what it will do so deposit betas are something that well just be monitoring we have a history of being just around on the deposit betas well see where all that ends up ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 yes just from a modeling perspective timur we do assume like a similar deposit beta experience this last time so but certainly given the loantodeposit ratio in the securities cash flow there is a lot more flexibility on the soft index than the nonindex deposits for us to be a little bit more disciplined about it so certainly that would be a part of our thinking for and timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then ram i saw in the deck that the reinvestment yields in the first quarter were still kind of high im just wondering what are you seeing today for reinvestments out of the bond book ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes its about basis points higher than where the rolloffs are going to be so if you look at one of our slides for the next months we expect rolloffs to be under and based on where the twoyear and the fiveyear are today our yields are closer to to so there is a nice pickup assuming this stays the way it is timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just last for me nice to see continued line usage ticking up in the commercial book im just wondering is there any particular industry that youre seeing incremental optimism or much of that line usage coming from and are we pretty close to a level of stability there or is the expectation that line utilization continues to ramp higher through the year mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp weve got tom terry with us let tom take that thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp yes its a good question the utilization really has been across the board our ci business has been very strong so there is not one particular industry to look at timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thanks for the questions mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks timur operator we now turn to nathan race from piper sandler your line is open nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yes hi guys good morning umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp morning nathan nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co question just on the rate sensitivity i appreciate the disclosures on slide and i think mariner just mentioned that about of the deposit base is hard or soft indexed i believe ram you threw out a number of close to in the quarter so just want to confirm that and if the beta on those deposits is contemplated in the interest rate sensitivity and i agree that you guys disclosed on slide ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes so the hard index mariner mentioned is about there is another thats soft indexed so the hard index one is formulaic and its not a beta it doesnt mean that for every basis points decline gets it could be anywhere from to of that so its not always beta the the soft index is where we have a lot of flexibility we do it on a case by case basis as opposed to adjusting market rates and that is contemplated in our projections on slide nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then just thinking about the securities portfolio balance on an absolute basis you had some growth in this quarter so just curious what the appetite is to continue to grow the securities book on an absolute dollar basis from here going forward versus maybe just allowing the cash thats on the balance sheet just to reprice higher as that rate increases rates ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes our open strategy is to continue to increase the size of our securities book so what is understated in the period end balances for investment securities as i talked about in my prepared comments is we add about million of market value decline because of what happened with rates so each month we talk about in our asset liability committee about reinvesting cash flows based on the current conditions and last few months and well probably continue this well also do some over buys with expected cash flows either from deposit flows or just the cash on the balance sheet mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and were keeping pretty short so thats the other part of that ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp and yes if you look at our afs portfolio the duration swap adjusted duration is months the nice thing in the last days is the twoyear part of the curve has as you see has increased about basis points so were keeping some of our cash flows of our cash flow is invested on the twoyear part of the curve two to three year part of the curve so were managing duration in the context of extension risk thats going to happen to all of us given where our rates are headed umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and i did mention on my prepared remarks also that second quarter loan growth the pipeline looks even stronger than the first quarter so thatll top up some of that also nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it just maybe turning to fees just maybe first one clarifying question the million in healthcare solutions is conversion costs is that more kind of onetime in nature is that more of a seasonal item that impacts would be resolved each quarter james d rine a president chief executive officerumb bank umb financial corp yes nate this is jim rine that is a onetime event and we dont anticipate that thats happened this year and last year we dont anticipate that happening again going forward in any material amount mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp its the tail end of a couple of james d rine a president chief executive officerumb bank umb financial corp yes mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp those relationships that weve talked about in previous quarters moving off our companies that we partner with that really decided to do the business for themselves and that has its the tail end of that behind us and so the grow for them talking about the growth james d rine a president chief executive officerumb bank umb financial corp yes the growth on the book that was by design that those were going to go away on the book that we have the growth has been yearoveryear and the card spend has been up yearoveryear as well without those relationships mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thats more of the forwardlooking trajectory of the business versus what was left from those two relationships nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co understood very helpful also on fees as we look out over the next few quarters curious where you guys see a lot of the growth opportunities obviously fund services and the corporate trust and institutional asset management remain bright spots across the various fee income lines so just curious if you expect those two umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 lines in particular to be kind of primary drivers for overall fee income growth this quarter or im sorry going forward ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes thats those are areas we are very excited about the backdrop for continued expansion and growth continue to be great for both of those specific businesses you brought corporate trust and fund services and the comments that ive been making in the past would be similar and so im about to make which is the backdrop for fund services in particular are twofold one whats happened in the public markets has really driven a lot of success in the private markets and our business is really heavily weighted towards being a fund services provider for the private equity hedge fund reit real estate markets where there is an enormous amount of strength from an investor community perspective were positioned very well in that space as one of the leaders and the second piece is with the disruption the activity from private equity firms in the space has created a lot of disruption in the sector and that has created an outsized opportunity for us within the space and so that continues to be the case were very excited you see the numbers on a linkedquarter basis the numbers are downside thats just market activity number of accounts is up and we continue to really on a yearoveryear basis its about a little over billion in assets under administration so trends continue to be great there corporate trust is a fantastic story a bit of a latent earnings story we continue to see the activity but as we talked about fees and also the eventual accelerated spending from state and federal government as we talk about building bridges highways sewer districts et cetera on a national basis we stand poised to be the main player certainly in our footprint and with our offices in new york and dallas we continue to pick up now share on in the coastal markets where the dollar volumes are larger so we played heavily for years as number player on a number of issues but were now number on volume because were playing in the coastal space where the deals are larger so if you take a water district deal in illinois or iowa or something thats going to be a couple of hundred million you do a water district deal in new york and talking billions so thats the trend in that business along with our aviation business which has been sliding sideways because of the pandemic and were starting to see that unleash as people are traveling again transactions are picking up again and so were super excited about whats going on in both of those businesses id say all the institutional businesses have great profiles right now across the board our as jim just mentioned what the trends are now for our health care business those are nice goforward trends the investor solutions business as all of our clients grow their clients we grow our business and then what isnt institutional which is our wealth business weve seen really good trends for new business in wealth so were pretty pumped about the trends for all of our fee businesses and excited about what lies ahead i dont know if you want to add anything jim james d rine a president chief executive officerumb bank umb financial corp i would just add fund services there is a crossover to the commercial division with the liquidity lines we provide for those funds so commercial has been able to provide referrals over to fund services additionally in the more traditional lines integrated payables is one of the really one of the best ways we can increase commercial fee income too that has been a great product for us producing 7figure fees for first quarter as far as with the tail to them and the backlog is very strong so umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp so coupled with commercial part james d rine a president chief executive officerumb bank umb financial corp exactly with card spend which is in your deck which has been as well nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co thats great color if i could just ask one more on investor solutions in particular i noticed that you guys written that in the deck bankingasaservice solution so im not sure if that implies kind of any shift in your strategy within that line or kind of how you guys are thinking about the opportunities obviously its a term we hear increasingly among banks these days they want to provide more depository services on the like to nonbank entities so i was just curious if there is kind of an update along those lines and kind of how you think about the opportunities going forward within that in particular mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well im not sure yes im not sure exactly i mean bankingasaservice is what that business is i mean thats what weve been doing so its just providing so the historical part of that business has been wirehouses brokerage firms and thats the mature part of the business and we have seen a lot of growth as you see in our deck with some of the fintechs that are wanting to provide banking services for their customers we are a premier provider for them as well to white label our banking products to and through their customers as well i dont know if that answers your question but that is the business is white labeling our banking products for broker dealers wirehouses and fintechs nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co right no i understand that the approach to that business isnt really changeable im not sure if theres any kind of shift in strategy going forward in terms of maybe working with some other entities outside the historical wirehouses and fintechs historically but i appreciate that color mariner mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yes no i think thats the path i mean the new path is the fintechs so as they create new ideas the new companies come up through the pipeline that we would be ready as kind of a premier provider in the space were a goto player for folks with new ideas ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp weve continued to build out apis to make it easier to access our systems but as far as the shift in strategy we have not shifted that strategy umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co understood okay again i appreciate the color thanks guys ill step back ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks nate operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty from kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc sure good morning ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc ram i want to make sure i got the color on the fees could you just repeat the i think you said it was million last year can you remember remind us whether it was precut and also how we should just be thinking about the correlation between revenues and rates thanks ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes so in before the fed cut rates by points on the onset of covid our run rate for that line item was million so million dropped to million and the point that we also make is back in the million was based on a book that was significantly smaller than what it is today so the potential for revenue with interest rates being hiked the way they are is pretty significant on that line item for us and we havent given specifics about the beta on that there is a lag usually typically between when the rate goes up and when we get to see the benefit of that but it should be a nice tailwind for us to hit in and if the future rates are where were going to be mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and rates have been rising sooner than we anticipated so that lags shorter so but i would also just add as ram mentioned related to the old book and the new book of business one example a pretty decent size example would be that back in our aviation trust business would have been very nascent and so the business that is one particular example youve got all the growth weve had in aviation trust and will have an aviation trust corporate trust that will benefit from fees christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 okay and so would those revenues pick up this year if you believe the forward curve is that and then where exactly in the fee income line would that be ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp it will be the brokerage and insurance line and we expect to see some benefits starting the second quarter based on what transpired in march christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc the other question i had relates to the indexed deposits that you referenced the kind of heard index could you just remind us where certainly you dont need the deposits from a liquidity perspective can you just remind us where the other benefits to having these deposits lie like where else in the full relationship do you realize the benefit for these higher beta deposits mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well i mean so i mean broadly speaking obviously deposits are raw material and were willing to take the pain and pressure for building our business for the long term i think youre asking specifically about some of the hard indexed money and why we take it and that would be like for example that would be an example would be a government piece of government business that would come with treasury would come with lockbox would come with bond issuance opportunities et cetera so you cant look at it at our deposits in a singular vertical you got to look at the overall profitability and we do that right so well move off something if the overall profitability isnt good but well take on some index or higher beta deposits because of the overall relationship that comes with lending treasury bond issuance fees et cetera christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yes thats what i was looking for thanks very much mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yes car service income you name it christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay i guess the final question i had would be weve seen so much liquidity flow into the system and were all as analysts trying to figure out what will stay and what will not are there any pockets of your deposit base that youre particularly worried about given the growth over the last months mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp sorry we have a little technical can you repeat that umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yes no problem i guess the risk of deposit parked money from with the fed unwinding the balance sheet your deposit growth has been great as of a lot of banks im just wondering if youve done any analysis to say hey is there any more chunky deposits that might be at risk of flight mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i mean we if you look at the pre and postpandemic volumes we are up about billion we debate internally a lot how much of that billion is excess and how much of that is based on new customer growth customer success et cetera just the growth of our business and we all have different answers to that internally and i think what youre describing is really that dialogue the whole country is having about what how much of this is excess liquidity im not sure that we want to claim to be any experts on that were watching it closely ram do you want to add to that ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes no we do alternative scenarios on the interest rate modeling for precisely that surge deposits right so if you just go back to history during the last rate cycle just before the fed started cutting rates our dda balances were like close to of our total deposits and what happened as the cycle transpired was it came down to right so we are assuming some kind of disintermediation from ddas to money market or other types of deposits so thats all built into our alternative scenario beta assumptions so we do expect some of that to transpire where our ddas are not going to be always at because of the interest rate cycles mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp but where that lands ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp where that land is anybodys guess and where the darp ph lies mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp there is i mean the good news for us is sitting at loantodeposit ratio is whether billion goes into other products or offbalance sheet or billion we still have an enormous amount of room to run up loan growth and feel very safe and sound about our liquidity and our loantodeposit ratio christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great thank you very much operator operator instructions we now turn to david long from raymond james your line is open umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone i wanted to dig a little deeper into the drivers on your ci growth and your expectations and your pipeline there is it driven by the ppp relationships that you gain is it just traditional market share gains obviously utilization have you been hiring veteran bankers within your footprint can you just talk about how some of those are impacting that growth and what really the core drivers are james d rine a president chief executive officerumb bank umb financial corp well this is jim rine its a really been the same story weve been telling the last several quarters and its been the market penetration its coming really from all regions and we are under penetrated in every market except kansas city and markets whether it be st louis dallas phoenix colorado there hasnt been one particular industry we are hiring the right talent they are calling on the right types of companies said before we have a compelling story we are able to turn things around quickly we are competitive on rates et cetera et cetera so its we target the right types of companies that we want to do business with and then were able to retain the top talent that we need in order to handle clients to grow the business so its been our formula and its been really whats made us successful for many years mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp you cant turn on ci overnight so when your mortgage business dries up and you want to turn on your ci business which some talk about it doesnt happen overnight unless youre taking on stuff you shouldnt be taking on so its just its a long long calling cycle with people that have been around a long time takes weve been building this business for years and the pipeline is built as such so it takes a lot of things to get to where we are james d rine a president chief executive officerumb bank umb financial corp but were not doing things we havent done were doing more of what we do so mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yes couple of areas i think that are benefiting right now the energy sector is pretty strong and so weve had some nice benefit in the energy sector theres a nice rebound in agribusiness with commodity prices and so were seeing some nice activity there industrial on the cre side continues to be very strong companies build inventories on a national basis for sameday lastmile distribution and theres depending on the market particularly in our marketplace which is in mountain midwest theres a shortage of housing so the multifamily umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 continues to be strong so while jim says its across all areas those are some areas that are outperforming and see some pretty strong directional trends david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it no thats appreciated good color and then the on the competitive side how is the competition impacting spreads in the commercial side of the business mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp its always robust and i dont know if theres anything else to say its always we go after the best business out there and everybody wants the best business and its always competitive james d rine a president chief executive officerumb bank umb financial corp so the pricing is always competitive in this rising rate environment people are willing to lock things in for a longer periods of time and so were doing what were comfortable with but when you see a 10year the request for the 10year fixed rates we would want to have those swaps versus fixing those on balance sheet and so you see some people stretching right now and were not willing to do that but outside of a few folks reaching its as competitive as its ever been mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp you might see some continued backtoback swap income for us over the next handful of quarters grow because of what jim just mentioned which is as customers look to lock rates well be increasing our swap fees david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks guys i appreciate you taking my questions james d rine a president chief executive officerumb bank umb financial corp thanks dave mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i might just add on slide for those of you who are interested in this excess liquidity and we talked about that i think that we have a slide in the bottom right quadrant of slide in our deck id point to you there its a really its a new little chart we put in place its very helpful i think to thinking about whats happened to excess liquidity and where you find it on our balance sheet and likely others balance sheets id point you there operator we have a followup question from nathan race from piper sandler please go ahead nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 just curious on how we should think about the trajectory of the reserve it doesnt sound like chargeoffs are likely to deviate from the historical ranges that you guys have talked about in the past so just im curious if we can expect the reserve to kind of hold around over the next few quarters or do you guys expect to build just given at least highsingledigit loan growth expectations going forward mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks thats a great question its another one of those sort of milliondollar questions right now i think if you think about all of us staring at this uncertain forwardlooking environment whether its recessionary or not or how deep the recession might be et cetera ill do a little bit of a soapbox here for us a guy whos been a ceo for years and watched this happen a few times it seems as though prececl we all as an industry seem to draw down our reserves towards the end of the cycle so that we had less reserves at the end of the cycle which is always a big mistake and has been a historic repeated deal for our industry we have always pushed against that and cecl has caused that to be a lot more of an algorithm a lot less optionality to how it works and weve got to be its very mathdriven based on in our case moodys so what moodys said is a big part of their forwardlooking projections has a lot to do with how we have to set our reserves i am kind of concerned at the industry level that you hear a lot of banks bragging about what their chargeoff rates are and im not sure its much to brag about when everything is perfect thats your chargeoff rates are perfect its really what matters about your chargeoff rate is what they look like when times tough not when theyre good and so im a little concerned at the industry level that were seeing it again that were drawing down our reserves so thats a little bit of kind of philosophical statement id make just as it relates specifically to us i we are im concerned about what late this year and next year looks like as it relates to the economy im not worried about our chargeoffs or our performance necessarily but i think the desire would be to hold you asked where they should be my desire would be that they should hold around where they are and thats my hope that using cecl now that our friends at moodys will also project that theres slightly higher unemployment and some weaken economic conditions that will allow us to hold our reserve around where it is so i dont know if thats helpful we have a lot of boxes when it comes to what our reserves look like and so my hope is that our friends at moodys do the right things and see the right things and we can keep our reserves around where they are ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes until that happens nate as you know a lot of our provision comes for loan growth so we see a lot of organic loan growth and thats whats driving our provision expense but clearly with the moodys variables economic forecast becoming more and more favorable each subsequent quarter the pressure on allowance ratio to come down is there right so if you look at what our day cecl allowance was it was basis points and i echo what mariner said is we get back to basis points but this is not the right time to get there but that said the quantitative part of the model is what it is right we use moodys forecast and we have to wait until moodys changes their forecast in anticipation of any economic conditions so at this point its hard to say thats a milliondollar question really umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yes the good news about us though is we have a very very long track record of having industryleading chargeoffs that being low chargeoffs right so we dont expect our performance to be any different than its been the last years regardless of what the environment is nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yes got it thats helpful and i fully appreciate its difficult to predict under the cecl framework particularly with all the uncertainty that exists out there perhaps maybe just one last one on capital obviously tce came down with the aoci swing this quarter so just curious to get an update just in terms of the buyback appetite obviously the stock has been under pressure over the last few months like a lot of your peers so just curious how you guys are thinking about the appetite for buybacks over the near term and then also just any update just in terms of what youre seeing from an acquisition opportunity perspective these days mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yes so obviously capital deployment as a broad statement the first thing we want to do is invest in our business so loan growth hiring people et cetera thats where our money is going to go making sure our technology is fresh second to that would be ma type activity and the same comments weve always made is that we continue to look for companies that fit both culturally and then add value that are accretive and add value to what were doing long term and then lastly you we always want to perform well enough to be able to increase our dividend every year and that is our goal is to be able to have the performance to allow us to continue to be one of the highest performers in the country as it relates to consistency of approach with our dividend and then lastly would be by opportunistic buybacks just keeping an eye on the market so its the last on the list weve demonstrated that we do it weve done it in the past at the right time and well continue to look at it and see if the if all of those other things are not available to us at the time in which we believe the price is right we will be buyers ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes the only thing id add is if you look at the periodend share count we did have  bought back early on in the first quarter so to mariners point we will be opportunistic about buybacks and then ill just echo my comments from the script which is even though tce has gown down its what we focus on is more of the riskbased regulatory capital ratios thats what we base our capital decisions on so that even though tce temporarily might be impacted based on whats happening with interest rates our focus for running the business is primarily the riskbased capital ratios nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and if i could just actually ask one more on just the expense outlook it seems like the salary line was seasonally impacted by the payroll impacts and so forth in the first quarter so just ram maybe any thoughts on just directionally how expenses trend into the second quarter and just kind of overall expense growth expectations for umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes without giving specific guidance so a lot of puts and takes from where our first quarter levels are generally the million that you see is a good jumpoff point obviously as you mentioned theres a lot of fica and payroll expenses that spiked in the first quarter especially with our bonus payments and so that should moderate a little bit but then the first quarter also had two less days or one less day compared to the second quarter so that should probably go the other way and then in april our normal merit cycle kicks into effect so that will have some wage inflation and that salary numbers but generally speaking i would say million is a good jumpoff point for the remainder of this year nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect i appreciate you guys taking the follow ups thanks again ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thank you operator our final question comes from jared shaw from wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey guys timur here with two more followup questions just maybe for ram looking at the kind of the variable rate loans what portion of that is currently at floors and can you just give us an update on kind of floor runoffs schedule ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes so of the billion or so of variable loans that we have we have floors to our in consideration to the on billion of those loans and then if the fed increases by basis points more than million of it will be in the money and then basis points later most of the book will be in the money on the floor side timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then last for me just the tickup in nonperforming loans i know its called out in the prepared remarks can you give us any additional color on loan type or industry any additional color would be helpful there thank you mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yes i dont think were really prepared to disclose that for various sundry reasons but it is one credit and as we mentioned in the comments we expect it to resolve itself favorably timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2022 okay great thank you operator we have no further questions
