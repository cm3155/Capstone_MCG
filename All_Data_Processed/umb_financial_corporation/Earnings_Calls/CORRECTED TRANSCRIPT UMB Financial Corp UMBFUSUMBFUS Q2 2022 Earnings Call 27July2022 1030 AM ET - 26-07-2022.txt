executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 thank you kay and thanks to everyone for joining us today our second quarter results included a linked quarter annualized increase in average loans solid net interest margin expansion and continued momentum in our fee businesses incomes from bond trading activities and fees were strong while we saw some market related pressure in trust and security processing and in the valuation of our equity positions additional drivers are included in our slides and ram will share more details shortly net income for the quarter was million or per share operating pretax preprovision income was million or per share financials for the second quarter included a pretax gain of million from the sale of our visa class b ownership included in the fee income in conjunction with the gain we made a one time contribution of million to our charitable foundation included in other expenses pipeline and sales activity continue to be strong across the company in private wealth we brought in nearly million in new assets yeartodate on track to significantly outpace the fullyear sales of million our institutional banking teams are continuing to perform well yeartodate new business volume has increased in corporate trusts and escrow services and in specialty trust and public finance have closed deals so far in compared to deals for the same period last year the team recently closed its largest bond issue to date a million general obligation bond as you may have seen in june we announced the agreement to acquire old national bancorps hsa business as healthcare services continues to focus on the direct to employer space this acquisition provides an extremely strong team along with more than million in deposits that will complement our organic growth efforts moving to lending youll see the drivers behind the growth this quarter on slide top line loan production as shown on slide again was very strong coming in at billion for the quarter payoffs and paydowns moderated some and were of loans given the opportunities we see across the footprint we expect continued strong growth in the third quarter we saw phenomenal growth in ci with balances increasing nearly on a linkedquarter annualized basis while line utilization ticked up slightly in the second quarter much of the growth is due to consistent sales efforts paying off in new customers as well as our relationships with strong companies needing capital to continue to grow average residential mortgage balances have increased over the second quarter of last year as we discussed previously we dont rely heavily on mortgage gain on sale revenue however we continue to grow our own portfolio and have seen strong activities through our down payment assistance program of late the program launched in december of and is geared towards underserved markets and it had more than new applications yeartodate on the other side of the balance sheet average total deposits for the quarter decreased or on an annualized basis compared to the first quarter while average dda balances increased slightly and comprised of average deposits while were seeing cycletodate beta on interest bearing deposits of approximately i think this metric alone gives an incomplete view as it ignores the benefit of dda balances which have zero data and the impact of borrowing levels which we have is beta id encourage you to look at our total cost of funds instead which had a beta of thus far umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 additionally we benefit on the earning assets side with cycletodate betas of nearly and a linkedquarter beta of this compares favorably to others weve seen report so far our net interest margin expanded basis points from prior quarter driven by asset repricing and favorable mix shift in earning assets ill note that the deposit prices were seeing is so far outperforming our internal expectations well continue to manage these costs as we can while opportunistically funding organic loan growth as you know we have a larger commercial institutional customer base relative to many peers as such we have some indexed deposits that tend to move more quickly with interest rate changes but we look to the entire relationship and overall profitability of these relationships for example many public fund customers bring treasury management lockbox card programs and bond issuances opportunities and in addition to lending relationships our commercial clients may also have corporate cards or healthcare service products similarly many of our institutional clients have asset servicing or suite product relationships in addition to the lending relationships moving to asset quality our net chargeoffs were elevated in the quarter driven entirely by a million write down related to one single commercial credit while this quarters chargeoffs were elevated we expect that our fullyear loss rate will be consistent with our longterm historical averages of approximately basis points or less nonperforming loans declined from the prior quarter to basis points of total loans as the overall portfolio continues to perform well our reserve coverage ratio is now of total loans in line with post cecl day implementation levels ill close by thanking our associates across the country for their hard work and dedication to our customers and communities im excited to execute on the opportunities we see in the second half of the year and beyond now i will turn it over to ram for some additional comments ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thank you mariner our strong loan growth coupled with the benefits of higher shortterm and longterm interest rates drove the linkedquarter increase in net interest income we amortized million of ppp origination fees into income and the overall ppp contribution to second quarter net interest income was million compared to million last quarter and million in the second quarter of at quarter end our ppp balances stood at million down from million on march approximately in unamortized fees remain as shown on slide our fed account reverse repo and cash balances declined to billion and now comprised of average earning assets with a blended yield of basis points compared to basis points in the first quarter the decrease in average deposits from the first quarter was driven by outflows of commercial deposits including the typical seasonal trends in public funds along with capital markets and corporate trust deposits the total cost of deposits including ddas was basis points up from basis points last quarter and the cycle todate beta is approximately net interest spread and net interest margin expanded from the first quarter by basis points and basis points respectively net interest margin benefited basis points from reduced umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 liquidity balances at rate basis points from low repricing and basis points from the benefit of free funds offset by a negative basis points related to the cost of interest bearing liabilities the estimated impact of net interest income at various rate scenarios is shown on slide in a rate ramp scenario of plus basis points on a static balance sheet net interest income is predicted to rise in year one and in year two this is predicated on repricing of our variable rate loans based on underlying changes to libor sofr and other indices as well as deposit betas and mix shifts consistent with the prior cycle while its early days our second quarter beta experience was in line to slightly better than our model assumptions as mariner noted while the focus on deposit betas is important we focus primarily on net interest spread management given that our future funding needs will depend on our continued efforts to fund our organic loan growth engine as weve done in prior cycles using cash flows from our highquality securities portfolio is another lever available to us to fund the loan growth opportunities our average loantodeposit ratio remains attractive at below our past highs in the low loan yields increased basis points from the first quarter to or about billion of average loans are variable rate but repricing in the next quarter and repricing within the next months as i noted these are largely tied to indices at the short end of the curve additionally the securities portfolio is expected to generate billion of cash flow in the next months the yield on those securities rolling off is approximately while purchases this past quarter were made at an average of those details are shown on slide we continue to reclassify securities to the heldto maturity portfolio during the second quarter to help manage tangible capital and reduce the impact of rising rates on our equity average htm balances for the second quarter excluding the billion of revenue bonds that weve long held in that book were billion the composition of our htm portfolio is shown on slide our regulatory capital ratios remained strong with the total riskbased capital at cet1 at and leverage at respectively back to the income statement total fee income for the quarter as shown on slide was million including the gain on the sale of our visa class b shares fee income compared to the first quarter was impacted by the million gain on that sale as well as other marketrelated valuations including a reduction of million in companyowned life insurance income and a million negative change in the security gain or loss line related to other equity positions and a million reduction in derivative income from backtoback swaps additionally the first quarter of included a million gain on the sale of our factoring business as well as million of healthcare services convergence fees excluding those variances second quarter fee income compared favorably to the first quarter levels one of the biggest drivers of the fee income momentum in the second quarter was the million quarterover quarter increase in brokerage fees where and money market revenue share fees are included in our income statement the decline in equity valuations had a modest impact on fees tied to aua and aum levels in the trust and securities processing line noninterest expense trends are shown on slide the linkedquarter decrease was driven primarily by a million reduction in deferred compensation expense related to the reduced coli income i mentioned along with lower payroll taxes insurance and 401k costs offsetting these reductions were the charitable contribution we umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 made during the quarter million in additional legal expenses related to general corporate activities and million of increased incentive costs for company performance our effective tax rate was for the second quarter and reflected a smaller proportion of income from the tax exempt municipal securities for the fullyear we anticipate that the tax rate will be between and that concludes our prepared remarks and ill now turn it back over to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call question and answer section operator operator instructions the first question comes from jared shaw of wells fargo timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is timur braziler filling in for jared ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey good morning timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe starting off good morning starting off on the deposit side just as youre thinking about funding this continued strong loan growth clearly you have plenty of onbalance sheet liquidity with a loantodeposit ratio you have million of deposits coming on later this year from the onb deal i guess how are you thinking about kind of funding the loan growth over the next couple of quarters how aggressive will you be in chasing new kind of deposit relationships in term here mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp timur thanks its mariner ill take that ram or jim anything else who take that they can jump in but i think its important to sort of pay attention to what our balance sheet looks like and has looked like for a long time the first quarter we always have our seasonal deposits runoff and if you take the runoff that you saw in through the first half of the year really it comes down to about billion million that would be indicative of whats happened to the whole industry as opposed to the hole that youre seeing because the rest of it would have been kind of that typical seasonality of our deposits so i would focus on it being about billion that went off and i think a couple of things i note about that one youve seen utilization rates go up borrowers are choose through their cash are starting to borrow energy costs and inventory costs costs are up in general so i think its indicative of customers really using their cash as opposed to monies leaving our balance sheet is what how i really describe more what has taken place with our deposits in addition to that weve talked many times in the past about the 14plus billion dollars we manage for customers off balance sheet and we can bring any of that on at any time and pay competitive rates weve demonstrated umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 that we can manage spread and margin expansion while also paying market competitive rates so the complexity of our customer base institutional commercial large corporate really allows us a lot of flexibility to bring deposits on and off our balance sheet and flex our balance sheet when we need to so really not worried about it at all and weve seen this before timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks for that and im just wondering in terms of the higher interestbearing deposit cost how much of that was due to the mix shift with maybe some of the lower cost deposits exiting to other vehicles versus either customers calling in and asking for higher rates or just posting higher rates across the board mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i would say we talked about this were about of hard index our total and so that obviously moves immediately with rate changes the rest of it were able to manage obviously of our deposits are noninterest bearing so i kind of maybe switch the story on a little bit focus some more on what we focus on if you think about the whole balance sheet instead of just deposits were only up basis points on total on the liability side and were up basis points on the asset side we are able to demonstrate as we always are spread expansion of basis points and margin expansion of basis points so and then you think about net income ultimately being the ultimate driver so you think about spread and margin being up along with nii being up thats what we focus on so were focused on being able to manage expansion margin spread and ultimately manage the increase of net interest income which ultimately results in a bigger bottom line timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then switching gears to asset quality any additional color you can provide around the million chargeoff maybe what industry it was in whats the remaining balance on that credit and how much you had previously reserved against it mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah id say there is going to be some limited comment here because the credit happens to be in bankruptcy we talked about this credit in the first quarter identified it and mentioned on our call in the first quarter that we thought we might be able to resolve it positively as the bankruptcy procedures progressed into the second quarter we realized still complexities and changes that that wasnt going to be the case anymore and we ultimately made a decision to take the charge there is nothing what i would say nothing that you could comment about it that would relate to any industry issues vertical issues underwriting issues per se and so it doesnt really there is no trending to point to here and as weve said before its a oneoff we have a long history of sort of demonstrating that we have a oneoff situation now and then if you look at page youll see the history in our deck if you look at it sort of tells the story sitting here with tom terry our chief credit officer jim rine our ceo and myself three of us have been running credit on credit committee for more than two decades together and this is nothing new and nothing different umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 we expect to return in the back half of the year to our historic levels of to or to basis points of chargeoff on annualized basis which is in line with our 15year history so thats pretty much what i would say oh yeah id also add prospectively in the data youll see that our npls have gone back down to basis points which i think is from all the reports ive seen the lowest prospective number of our peer group for npls timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah thats perfect corollary to my last question i guess that linkedquarter decline in nonperforming assets i mean what drove that was that return to payment was that just kind of were you looking at the underlying credits and moving them back to performing status i mean that was a pretty mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc exceptional move there progress mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp largely again because of how we operate it was it had peaked it has jumped because of this credit and now its declined back down to its normal levels largely timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks timur operator thank you the next question comes from nathan race of piper sandler please proceed nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah ram perhaps a question is if we add back the coli impact within salaries in terms of the overall operating expense run rate going forward any thoughts just kind of directionally in terms of kind of how the total run rate trends in the back half of ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah i would say i would use the million that we reported this quarter and as we noted million of deferred comp expense was a credit to expense this quarter so if you add million it is million and umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 then take million away from the charitable account foundation so well get to million i would say of million of legal expense increase some of it was tied to some extraneous factors that we dont expect to recur so were talking about a run rate of million to million plus or minus for operating expenses nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then just going back to the chargeoffs in the quarter was the loan that was charged off here in was that the same one that you guys flagged last quarter in terms of expecting some favorable occurrence on mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yes and i just mentioned a moment ago yeah it is and i just mentioned a moment ago as the bankruptcy procedures progressed from first quarter to second quarter the situation has changed and evolved so nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay understood and then just in terms of it sounds like pipelines are in good shape and you guys are still expecting above average loan growth going forward and with the reserve now down to the cecl day level how do you guys kind of think about the need to provide for growth and just the overall macro uncertainty that exists today assuming chargeoffs go back to that to fixed point range that you talked to earlier mariner mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah we are so yes first answer we do expect loan growth to continue at favorable levels as theyve been and as it relates to how we reserve against it as you know weve talked about this since cecl the algorithm is a lot more complex than it used to be we had to rely on moodys for as we look forward into this unemployment data if that evolves and go into recession there is a lot of unknowns about how all of us will have to factor in the economic data factors and how we build that into our algorithm so there are some unknowns there about how that i would suggest from my vantage point were staring at least marginally unfavorable economic data which would which on it from the algorithm standpoint that will drive us to preserve a little loan growth should drive us to the reserve and the thing that works against this related to the algorithm is if our data continues to get better and bad data rolls off and exchange for good data on our portfolio that pushes against us reserving so its the connection and the relationship between the two of those but i would suggest that we would probably marginally see us reserving a little bit against the economic conditions and the loan growth that we see and as would be the prudent and right thing to do anyway and how that plays off against basis points i mean our preference would be not to see it go down at odds ratio but weve got an algorithm that we have to live with and so i hope thats helpful and i dont know ram if you had anything ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp no nothing umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah super helpful and if i could just ask one more just going back to the balance sheet discussion from the earlier question i just want to make sure i understand the kinds of the expectations for deposit levels in the earning asset base going forward it sounds like youre expecting some additional outflows maybe in and then you have the hsa deposits coming on so just overall ram perhaps how should we kind of be thinking about the earning asset base going forward with those deposit dynamics at play mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i dont think we expect to see further outflows in the third quarter necessarily so i would say stable to maybe grow a little bit based on our ability to bring on as i talked about earlier we can bring on as much of the billion we have off balance sheet by paying competitive rates so i dont see us going backwards more of a stabilizing approach for the rest of the year and then having the hsa deposits coming along this way out yeah and then again remember we can rotate investments in the loans too right so we have a billion investment portfolio and a loan to deposit ratio so weve got that also working for us ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp therell be some real time thinking on the portfolio side nate in terms of just whether we reinvest our cash flows from our securities portfolio every month we talk about it at our asset liability committee sometimes we choose to reinvest sometimes depending on what the deposit outlook looks and loan growth outlook looks we might decide not to reinvest nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay understood i appreciate all the color and you guys taking the questions mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks nate operator thank you operator instructions the next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw please proceed nicholas moutafakis q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning this is nick moutafakis on for chris mcgratty at kbw i wanted to start can you guys just remind me what the monthly cash flow runoff is for your bond book mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah on page youll see the portfolio statistics nick and for the next months we expect about billion to come from our portfolio umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 nicholas moutafakis q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great and then just on the cash level obviously you guys kind of reduce cash youre down to about of average earning assets can we look at this as kind of the floor for the cash levels or could we just potentially run that down even further to fund future loan growth mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah and if you look at the bottom of the slide on page we show the prepandemic levels right so if you look at the interestbearing deposits its slightly higher than where we were prepandemic so we could expect some additional contraction in those balances but obviously as you see on a quarteroverquarter basis its response to what happened on the deposit side of the equation we did see some normalization of these balances nicholas moutafakis q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh sure okay thats helpful and then maybe just on the loan growth side as you look into the back half of is there any portfolio where we could see some upside surprise and also potential slowdowns as far as different categories mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well i think i mean from a growth standpoint we give you a picture into the upcoming quarter as we always do so third quarter looks strong as it has i would say it seems to be coming across the board from all categories and all regions we dont really get too far beyond a one quarter look as far as the guidance goes but just the indicators for growth seem to be good as you look into the whole back half of the year and as far as the upside and downside were all kind of dealing with the same facts there as it relates to we got the fed decision today what happens with the labor markets what happens with the back half of this year i think as i said i think the last quarter companies are doing pretty well theyre sort of sold out from last year on into through this year so i think the impact of a recession is really a impact so loan growth feels pretty good for the remainder of this year james d rine a president chief executive officer umb bank na investment management this is jim rine the only one of the things that could be a downside surprise for banks would be the increase in rates and at what point do people decide not to take on the next project or this bad backlog be cancelled that is already booked but that isnt happening yet and were staying in close contact with our clients and theyre already baking those increases into their projections and pay offs slow that could also be another factor mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yes weve seen in from first quarter to second quarter we are already seeing that moderate because of higher rates so we went from mid to on payoffs and paydowns you also utilization rate is up marginally and i umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 think both of those things will be based on the current book also about of our new business in the second quarter was from new customers so that also we should see sort of booey things for the back half of the year we talked to construction companies about their backlogs jim talks about that theyll all say theyre still very strong and the only thing they see the developers there is a bit of a softening in the forwardlooking pipeline for developers but thats being made up for larger projects public private and kind of large data farms and distribution facilities and multifamily and areas where there is still a lot of need kind of making up for logistics and things like that are making up for some of that more expensive borrowing and land costs nicholas moutafakis q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great that was a great color and thank you for taking my questions mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp lets not forget also that the rates are still at historically low levels right talking heads talk about all of the crazy stuff going on with the rates were still at historically low levels so thats i think theyre saying operator thank you the next question comes from john rodis of janney please proceed john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc good morning everybody ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey good morning john john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey ram on the margins can obviously nice expansion can you talk about maybe just give a little more detail do you have what the margin was maybe in june and how we should think about the margin going forward ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp i dont think that we get specific into any of it just because of the deposit inflows and outflows its hard to just use any months data but i would say obviously with the basis points that we got in the second quarter that was probably a little faster than probably up for the industry and for us as well but we continue to expect a modest margin expansion going forward based on where we see the loan pricing were going to be fairly disciplined on the deposit side and managing that as you heard mariner talk about were going to manage the net interest spread and make sure that that translates to margins being maintained or expanding from here but at a more moderate pace than in the second quarter john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 okay makes sense and ram just one more question on the brokerage fees i mean i get the higher rates and the fees i guess i was a bit surprised to see the jump from the first quarter to the second quarter i think in prior quarters youve talked about looking back to i think when where the brokerage fees were in for the whole year they were million can you just talk about what was the net number this quarter and then moving forward what do you see in the brokerage line item to the extent you can ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah i think it was a pleasant surprise for all of us obviously with the fed raising rates by basis points and the back end of these investments being really short term in nature and where the treasury curve is it was a nice surprise for us so what we said relative to the million back in was that book of off balance sheet deposits where we get revenue share and fees has doubled so clearly we see some opportunities as interest rates stay elevated to be able to mimic the million million run rate that you saw in the second quarter mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and hopefully have it quicker ram alluded to it because the shortend came up and so we just the yield curve has made a big difference in how quickly that happened and how quickly money markets were able to invest and make money on the shorter end of the yield curve which allowed them to share with us sooner john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay so ram mariner just to clarify though again so it should stay at this level if we get no further rate increases or even with further rate increases just given where the forward curve is i guess ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah you could marginally increase depending on what happens with our off balance sheet deposit rate you heard mariner answer about deposit question we can actually tap some of these off balance sheet deposits so balances go down on the other hand if our aviation and corporate trust businesses pick up faster than we expect we could see more deposits being added in the off balance sheet category and we can see more volume driven increases to this line item but i think just like my question about margin i think the any ongoing increases will be modest compared to second quarter lows mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah there is the size of the off balance sheet book and then there is a rate pay grade so on a rate pay side thats going to moderate so i think theres room it kind of depends on what happens to the short end of the yield curve john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp so it is likely moderate but i think there is some increase still in there with rates still rising and then it just decides the size of the book i expect we expect to continue to grow a lot of that has to do with whats happening with the municipal underwriting on a national basis it has to do with what happens with aviation planes being bogged sold moved things like that and so i again also sort of expect that to grow a bit so john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay makes sense thanks for the color guys thank you ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks john operator there are currently no further questions registered at this time so i will pass the conference back over to the management team
