client franchise continue to be evident this quarter as we delivered net earnings of billion record quarterly earnings of per share and a return on equity of and return on tangible equity of our third quarter results contributed to strong yeartodate revenues of billion and then roe of litigation costs burdened our yeartodate returns by over basis points returns were also impacted by higher reserve builds for credit losses in the first half the third quarter continued to demonstrate the strength of our diversified business we benefited from an improving market backdrop high levels of client engagements continued countercyclical performance in market making and positive momentum across our strategic initiatives we maintained our leading global position in ma as announcements increased in the quarter from a relatively dormant period earlier in the year we maintained strong league table positions in underwriting including a number one ranking in equity underwriting and a top three ranking in high yield with both markets very active during the quarter we again delivered robust performance in global markets in both ficc and equities on solid client activity across our global platform reinforced by recent market share gains across asset classes in the first half of in asset management we recognized strong gains from our public and private equity positions we also generated

total commitments we are delivering our full spectrum of alternatives capabilities and have launched marketing on new funds in private equity growth equity and real estate in wealth management we

leveraging our credit card platform for additional partnerships over time the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 turning to the operating environment on page two we continue to navigate an uncertain backdrop brought on by covid19 which has an unclear trajectory from a macroeconomic perspective the markets continue to benefit from the unprecedented monetary and fiscal support by central banks and governments globally in the third quarter the federal reserve announced its new approach to average inflation targeting and forecasted that shortterm rates would remain locked near zero for the next several years in that same vein in the uk where the economy is expected to contract by over this year the bank of england opened the door to negative rates as a potential policy tool meanwhile us labor markets continue to show headline improvement with the unemployment rate declining to in september down nearly from peak levels in april reflecting approximately million people out of work that said according to the latest jobs report those improvements were largely driven by reversals of temporary layoff while permanent job losses have risen to nearly four million people reflecting some of the deeper challenges in our economy additionally there continues to be enormous uncertainty globally in the trajectory of the virus which may impact the pace of the economic recovery as we head into the fall and winter in particular we see continued challenges in a number of impacted industries including restaurants hospitality and oil and gas despite these uncertainties since our july earnings call our economists expectations for us gdp improved by basis points to an expected contraction of while global growth estimates slipped basis points to an expected contraction looking at the next year estimates have strengthened with expected growth of nearly in the us and globally in spite of the ongoing challenges we are seeing higher global equity markets and tighter credit spreads perhaps as a reflection of the speed of economic recovery during the third quarter the sp rallied by touching new highs in september leaving the index up for the year this yearly gain however was concentrated in the top tech companies which rose while the remaining names in the index declined by equity market volatility also remains elevated with the average vix this quarter more than higher than the third quarter a year ago though well below levels seen in march and april on the credit front us investmentgrade spreads tightened by roughly basis points and highyield spreads tightened by almost basis points during this quarter as we go forward we remain vigilant about risks in the markets and potential weakness in the broader economy given the uncertain macro environment we are focused on serving our clients to help them navigate this evolving backdrop before turning to stephen id like to spend a moment on our approach to return to office weve employed a number of new protocols to operate as safely as possible around the world we do this as public and private healthcare organizations work tirelessly to develop therapies and vaccines which i fully believe in time will allow all of us to return to a more normalized environment we are focused on helping our people come back safely as being together enables greater collaboration which is key to our culture we continue to employ an adaptable approach which considers individual circumstances and local health recommendations to give our people the flexibility and the tools they need to return to the office safely we continue to make measured progress in hong kong and tokyo we have around of our people working from the office in most of europe were at around and in the uk were at nearly in new york weve seen a gradual uptick since labor day with roughly people working in office as of last week and we currently have of our people rotating through new york office on a weekly basis the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 that said we will continue to be nimble and remain in close contact with the relevant authorities in cities where we operate and are ready to shift gears if the evolving situation with covid19 warrants under all circumstances we continue to keep the health and safety of our people as a top priority in closing i would like to thank the people of goldman sachs whove remain dedicated to serving our clients while managing the firms risk liquidity and capital to ensure our ongoing financial strength and operational resiliency while has been a difficult year in many ways im incredibly pleased with the state of our client franchise and progress weve made in executing on our strategic priorities and i look forward to providing a more comprehensive update on our investor day goals at our fourth quarter earnings call in january with that ill turn it over to stephen stephen m scherr chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david and good morning let me begin with our summary results on page during the third quarter the firm performed well across all four of our business segments in investment banking our corporate clients remained very active in raising debt and equity capital we also saw an increase in strategic dialogue following a more dormant period for ma activity earlier in the year in global markets client engagement remained high as we gained share during the year and enabled clients to manage risks across asset classes in asset management strong growth was driven by higher management and other fees as well as gains from our longterm equity and credit investments following a more challenged first half of the year we also saw doubledigit revenue growth in our consumer wealth management segment as we expand our service offering to individuals across the wealth spectrum with those headlines let me now turn to our specific business performance on page beginning with investment banking investment banking produced third quarter net revenues of nearly billion up versus a year ago financial advisory revenues of million declined versus last year on fewer transaction closings in the quarter reflecting the lower level of client activity in the first half of the year nevertheless yeartodate we participated in over billion of announced transactions and closed approximately deals for billion of deal volume we maintained our number one position in both announced and completed ma league tables by a meaningful margin importantly the pace of ma announcements has picked up considerably in recent months our announced deal volume in the third quarter was up more than fivefold versus the second quarter and our investment banking client dialogues remain active the bigger headline in investment banking again in the third quarter was equity underwriting where we regenerated million in revenues more than double the levels seen a year ago marking our second highest quarter ever we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting as our yeartodate volumes climbed billion across deals including initial public offerings in global ipos we ranked number one and picked up approximately basis points of market share versus last year we also saw strong activity this quarter in followons and new products including our participation in private transactions a highprofile direct listing and a number of spac ipos providing clients advice and access to capital in various forms the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 in debt underwriting net revenues were million up from a year ago though volumes normalized from the record pace seen in the second quarter the high yield market in particular saw healthy levels of new issue activity our activity also included a number of novel structured transactions particularly among industries most impacted by covid19 such as airlines where we uniquely enabled clients to leverage a broader collateral base to access capital as a result weve been able to support our clients and grow our market share generating a solid number four ranking in global debt underwriting yeartodate this performance reflects our longterm strategic focus on this business as well as the velocity of underwriting commitments on our balance sheet looking forward our investment banking backlog increased significantly versus the second quarter growth was supported by a ramp in ma activity as i noted earlier as well as replenishment from equity and debt underwriting transactions in particular new ma announcements are creating a pipeline for acquisition financing in the coming quarters we are optimistic on activity across a broad set of sectors including tmt fig consumer healthcare and industrials revenues from corporate lending were million reflecting lower results in relationship lending which includes the impact of tighter credit spreads on hedges as ive noted before for risk management purposes we maintain single name hedges on certain larger lending commitments given the significant credit spread tightening over the last two quarters we have now reversed the vast majority of the million in hedge gains we saw in the first quarter also of note in relationship lending weve seen material pay downs versus the first half total notional drawn on revolvers is now down from the peak and nearing normalized levels moving to global markets on page where our businesses continued their strong performance net revenues were billion in the third quarter up versus a year ago amid attractive bid offer spreads a supportive marketmaking backdrop and continued elevated client activity we expanded our market share this year as our focus and commitment to serve clients during this volatile period drove results across asset classes and geographies during the first half mckinsey reported that goldman sachs global markets delivered the best institutional client performance among our global peers our strength was aided by number one rankings in both g10 rates and credit and the number one global ranking in equities which included the number one position in emea and ties for number one in asia and japan turning to ficc on page third quarter net revenues were billion up versus the third quarter of growth versus last year was driven by a increase in intermediation which more than offset a decrease in financing revenues in ficc intermediation we had solid client flows and grew revenues in four out of five businesses versus last year leveraging our balance sheet to intermediate risk in a disciplined way in credit performance was supported by strong client activity in the us and tighter investmentgrade and highyield credit spreads we also saw sustained volumes across our automated bond pricing engine in rates revenues rose amid stronger risk management while client activity was solid particularly around global central bank actions during the quarter in commodities strong performance was driven by our metals business and oil products amid persistent global supply imbalances in mortgages revenues rose amid higher levels of client activity in agency products bolstered by solid risk management and tighter spreads in currencies revenues were stable as we continued to serve our global client franchise with contributions across both g10 and emerging markets lastly in ficc financing we saw lower revenues in repo and structured finance turning to equities net revenues for the third quarter were billion up versus a year ago equities intermediation net revenues of billion rose aided by higher client volumes across derivatives and cash the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 reflecting the scale and breadth of our client franchise in derivatives we saw solid activity in flow structured and corporate transactions across both the us and europe in cash we helped clients execute across both high and lowtouch channels equities financing revenues of million declined yearoveryear due to higher net funding costs including the impact of lower yields on our liquidity pool importantly average client balances rose to nearrecord levels across global markets we continue to invest in technology platforms to enhance client experience build on our strength in risk management and drive resource efficiencies like digital trends across many industries covid has accelerated client adoption and onboarding across our automated platforms while it remains difficult to predict client activity and we do not have insight into the forward opportunity we take confidence in the market share gains experienced by the business through a deepening set of client relationships which has been a priority for the global markets leadership team this progress should support revenue sustainability as we go forward we also believe the upcoming us election the variability of economic growth outlook and the global libor transition may bolster client activity across markets additionally to the extent that sustained low interest rates have their intended effect of stimulating economic growth and recovery client activity may be further invigorated moving to asset management on page in the third quarter we generated segment revenues of billion up over versus a year ago our third quarter revenues were driven by the continued market rebound event driven activity and positive corporate performance of our portfolio companies management and other fees totaled million up versus a year ago driven by higher average assets under supervision partially offset by a lower fee rate due to mix shift given growth in liquidity and fixed income products equity investments produced billion of net gains aided by appreciation in our public investments and valuation marks related to eventdriven activity across our private equity portfolio more specifically on our billion public equity portfolio we generated nearly million in gains from investments including bigcommerce avantor sprout and headhunter and on our billion private equity portfolio we generated gains of more than million from various positions with the majority driven by events including corporate actions such as fundraisings capital markets activities and outright sales additionally we had operating revenues of million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities finally net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were million on revenues from nii and gains on fair value debt securities and loans this reflected modestly tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments which continued to rebound from the broader market selloff in the first quarter let me now turn to page where we continue to provide transparency on the composition and diversification of our asset management balance sheet on the left side of this slide is our equity investment portfolio by sector geography and vintage our private portfolio remains highly diversified with over positions where excluding global atlantic given its announced sale none are larger than million the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 we also provide insight into our billion portfolio of cies primarily comprised of real estate investments of which billion are financed predominantly by nonrecourse debt the portfolio remains diversified by geography and real estate sector on the right side of the slide we show our billion in lending and debt investments in the portfolio within the asset management segment which includes billion of debt investments and billion of loans that are largely secured ill now turn to consumer wealth management on page in this segment we produced billion of revenues in the third quarter up versus a year ago driven by higher wealth management aus and higher consumer banking revenues wealth management and other fees of million rose versus last year reflecting increased client transaction activity and higher assets under supervision which rose to billion including billion of positive net inflows over the past months consumer banking revenues were a record million in the third quarter jumping versus last year reflecting net interest income from credit card lending strong yearoveryear deposit growth and lower deposit rates consumer deposits totaled billion reflecting billion of growth in the quarter the slower pace was expected as we continued to limit uk new account growth in light of regulatory caps and reduced the rate on our us market savings accounts given the lower interest rate environment while we exhibited improving beta in our deposit book we saw very limited outflows of deposits consistent with our expectations despite two rate cuts during the quarter funded consumer loan balances remained stable at billion of which approximately billion were from marcus loans and billion from apple card we continue to prudently riskmanage these portfolios and have moderated growth relative to initial budget estimates while we remain attentive to the embedded risk we continue to be pleased with the credit performance of these portfolios next lets turn to page for our firmwide assets under supervision total aus decreased slightly to trillion during the quarter but are up approximately billion versus a year ago our sequential decline was driven by billion of liquidity outflows following strong inflows in the first half that offset by billion of market appreciation and billion of longterm inflows on page we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments total firmwide nii was billion for the third quarter up versus a year ago primarily reflecting growth in the firms balance sheet particularly in global markets as well as the benefit from deposit growth and repricing in consumer wealth management importantly as i have noted in the past our overall results are less sensitive to lower interest rates than many traditional banks our balance sheet is modestly assetsensitive given our mix of high turnover or floating rate assets and predominantly hedged or floating rate liabilities nevertheless even if interest rates remain low we expect nii to gradually expand over time given our ability to prudently grow loans and further reprice consumer deposits next lets review loan growth and credit performance across the firm our total loan portfolio at quarterend was billion down billion sequentially driven by a billion decrease in corporate loans from paydowns in relationship lending and a billion reduction in marcus installment loans offset by modest growth in wealth management and credit card loans our provision for credit losses in the third quarter was million meaningfully lower than the billion taken last quarter and down versus a year ago this lower provision versus the second quarter reflects relative the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 stability in our portfolio and improvements in the broader economic backdrop which is the dominant driver of inputs to our modeling of pool reserves at quarterend our allowance for credit losses for both loans and commitments stood at billion including billion for funded loans our allowance for funded loans was stable versus last quarter at for our billion accrual portfolio including an allowance for wholesale loans of and for consumer loans of the provision of million includes wholesale impairments of approximately million primarily relating to select credits in the tmt industrials and natural resources sectors during the quarter weve recognized firmwide net chargeoffs of million resulting in an annualized net chargeoff ratio of up basis points versus last quarter next lets turn to expenses on page our total quarterly operating expenses of billion increased versus last year with compensation expenses up yearoveryear amidst higher revenue growth net of provisions and noncompensation expenses down higher compensation expense reflected yearoveryear growth in revenue net of credit provisions our noncomp expenses were slightly lower versus last year as we continued to invest in new businesses including transaction banking and credit card as well as the united capital acquisition now rebranded personal financial management while we benefited from lower expenses of approximately million from the temporary reduction in travel entertainment and advertising expenses due to covid19 we also saw an approximately million reduction in litigation and professional fees and a roughly million reduction in double occupancyrelated costs from our new facilities in london and bengaluru these were offset by roughly million increase in activityrelated expense from brokerage clearing and exchange fees as well as a roughly million increase related to technology investments across the firm our reported yeartodate efficiency ratio was which was burdened by nearly percentage points of litigation expense we continue to make progress on our expense savings initiatives as set forth at investor day and will continue to assess our ability to go further than what we outlined in january finally our reported tax rate was for the yeartodate reflecting the impact of nondeductible expenses as noted previously we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately over the next few years turning to our capital levels on slide our common equity tier ratio improved to at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach up basis points sequentially the improvement was driven primarily by earnings as well as lower market rwas reflecting reduced market volatility and lower credit rwas our ratio under the advanced approach increased basis points to also on earnings and rwa reductions from lower market volatility we are confident in our capital position now basis points above our stress capital buffer requirement looking forward we continue to believe that the to standardized cet1 target range provided at investor day is appropriate for our firm on a mediumterm basis as we execute our strategic initiatives build more durable feebased revenues and reduce the stress loss intensity of our business to that end we will continue asset harvesting including our announced sale of global atlantic while our capital ratio will likely remain elevated nearterm given continued regulatory restrictions on share repurchases we would expect our management buffer to decline over time particularly as markets express less volatility importantly we stand ready to commit capital and balance sheet to support our clients and we expect to resume share repurchases once permitted consistent with our longstanding capital management policy the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 turning to the balance sheet total assets ended the quarter at trillion roughly flat versus last quarter we maintained very high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging billion up modestly versus last quarter reflecting the current backdrop we expect our gcla will evolve in the context of client demand for our balance sheet and overall market conditions on the liability side our total deposits decreased to billion down billion versus last quarter driven by planned rolloff of higher cost brokered deposits and more modest growth in retail deposits our longterm debt declined by billion during the quarter driven by maturities we expect issuance to remain relatively low for the remainder of the year although we may consider prefunding some planned first quarter issuances in conclusion our strong third quarter results reflect the diversification of our client franchise resilience of our business model and flexibility in our highly liquid balance sheet despite the continued overhang from covid19 and challenges from the workfromhome environment we continue to leverage our technology platforms and intellectual capital to support our clients during this difficult time we remain dedicated to executing our strategy in our core business and driving forward the new initiatives and operating efficiency programs we laid out in january importantly we have been proud to see our dedicated client engagement efforts continue to pay off resulting in gains in mindshare and market share as we help clients navigate this volatile environment on the forward our risk managers will remain in a conservative posture given the uncertain trajectory of the virus and early stages of the recovery to ensure we are wellpositioned to proactively support our clients while our path to our medium term targets will inevitably not be a straight line we remain confident that execution of our strategic plan will drive better client experience more durable revenues and higher returns for shareholders over time with that thank you again for dialing in and well now open the line for questions the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc hey glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi so obviously hello so obviously great great trading results im curious if you could characterize any how you think about any incremental risk you take to execute all that and if theres any impact on future stress tests im just looking to balance client franchise with any risks associated with it thanks stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure glenn thanks so i would say the performance of the trading businesses in the third quarter frankly like it was in throughout most of the first part of the year was really done with an eye toward high velocity turn on balance sheet that is we were very wellprepared to commit capital to facilitate intermediation but saw our mission equally as moving and trading on that risk very efficiently and so we could see the kind of turnover that we needed we didnt see dramatic pickup in risk occasioned by that pattern and that strategy and i think that leaves us in a good position with respect to what we will submit as part of the second version of ccar and i dont see our risk as being unusually elevated in the context of producing these kinds of results glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi well god bless thats great and then i missed it i dont know if you gave us the realized versus unrealized split i think i wrote down everything you said on the equity and im talking equity investment line i couldnt tell how much of it was actually realized and the lead or the followon to that is have you considered monetizing more with markets at alltime highs you have a pretty seasoned portfolio with twothirds in the four to eightyearsold plus range so im looking to see how you balance the capital intensity of those investments with the earnings power and what your capital deployment options are right now thanks stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure sure no problem so let me just go through the breakdown in equity so of the billion in revenue our public portfolio generated million in revenue and the private part of the equity portfolio generated million now importantly when you look at the private portfolio million of that million was generated on events so thats sales monetizations ipos and the like and million only million was nonevent the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 driven that is looking at the baseline performance of the underlying company and making a judgment about where value is appropriately pegged and so event being the dominant component of the private portfolio the balance i should point out of million relates to cies as it relates to the public portfolio we observe the market no differently than you do obviously theres a certain component of that public portfolio that remains restricted a decent amount of it remains unrestricted and we will look for opportunities as we have been to monetize those stakes by the way i say that not just simply in the context of an attractive market valuation in which to sell but equally in the context of the kind of broader strategic mission weve been on which is to lower the balance sheet intensity and capital intensity of that as we shift to more thirdparty investing itself and so that gives you a bit of the lay of the land as to the two components to your question glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks so much appreciate it stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure operator audio gap comes from the line of christian bolu with autonomous please go ahead christian bolu q analyst autonomous research llp good morning david and stephen maybe sticking with the trading question stephen you gave some pretty interesting color on why you think trading revenues could be sustainable into can you expand on those a bit im particularly interested in your point around libor transition could you just give us more detail there and sort of why you think goldman is wellplaced to capitalize stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so why dont i start with trading i think at the core our view on sustainability is not with a crystal ball and a forward forecast as to what the opportunity set will be it is more rooted in the fact that over the course of the year and looking at data through the first half we have picked up meaningful market share in and among various client sets across all of the businesses in our trading business and this was a very concerted effort on the part of the leadership of that business to go at finding ourselves moving up the ladder in the top clients that matter to the trading division so the sustainability of our performance for me is rooted more in the fact that weve picked up share gains we were there for clients particularly during the most volatile moments of the second quarter across all asset classes without withdrawing and i think it sets us up to capture whatever the opportunity set is on the forward my comments in the prepared remarks is that as i look forward to the fourth quarter we can count on any number of issues to be the source of some volatility whether thats us election libor transition the trajectory of covid any one of those and part of the reason that we are at capital levels we are part of the reason weve maintained higher liquidity than we ordinarily would is such that we can serve clients should that volatility occur without putting ourselves offsides on any one of those metrics and i think thats part of the color id give you both in terms the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 of whats sustainable and equally why we feel confident that weve put our financial resources in a proper frame to sort of play on the volatility itself just lastly on your question about libor transition weve had a dedicated team i mean people who are dedicated to this effort from the beginning weve put ourselves in a position where weve done issuance we have prepared ourselves in terms of counterparty contracts and the like and i think were very wellprepared obviously we dont skew in ways in which commercial banks do with liborbased elements in mortgages and the like but in the scope of what is our business we feel quite wellprepared for that onset christian bolu q analyst autonomous research llp great thank you maybe switching to acquisitions again maybe david this one is for you given the frenzy at morgan stanley on deals just curious how youre thinking about ma maybe what businesses or initiatives would benefit from an acquisition and then if you can just touch on how you think your relative currency and sort of capital position places you to do a transformative deal david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so christian i appreciate the question and of course we laid out a mediumterm plan with a set of goals and you and others continue to ask us about this were on a journey to continue to strengthen our returns and broaden our business to create a more diverse business with more sustainable revenues over time we now have the business we think fully set up and organized after we resegmented last year and made some changes internally so that the platforms that we think we can really operate from are wellpositioned to grow and this includes our two more traditional platforms that everybodys always focused on investment banking and global markets which really for lack of a better term is a corporate investment bank we have a big asset management platform which is global broad deep multiproduct all over the world and we think there are opportunities to continue to grow that organically for sure but certainly we consider inorganic opportunities to grow that if we thought that they were enhancing and then we obviously are building a broader consumerwealth platform to serve individuals and we certainly think there can be opportunities to accelerate the growth of that in fact last year we made an acquisition in united capital that we think accelerated our expansion into high net worth wealth in a meaningful way and weve now been integrating that quite successfully so we continue to look broadly at things that can extend our strategy and accelerate the pace its clear if you look at the actions of others that the market has been tolerant of tangible book value dilution in the context of something they think is on strategy and advances the trajectory of the business so well continue to look and see if there are opportunities but other than that it would be hard for me to say anything more at this point christian bolu q analyst autonomous research llp okay thats helpful thank you david operator audio gap comes from the line of mike carrier with bank of america please go ahead michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 all right good morning and thanks for taking the questions first one just on the efficiency ratio you guys beat the this quarter and yeartodate thats the legal youre ph at the i guess the good takeaway is the operating leverage clearly works in the model but can you provide some color to maybe where youre at in the like the investment and efficiency in a threeyear timeline and most of its just to help with the expense trend line the efficiency ratio outlook depending on how the revenue backdrop plays out ahead david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc ill start stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah go ahead david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc and stephen might give some more granular detail but id say at a high level michael and i appreciate the question theres no question that our efficiencies benefited from an environment which has allowed us an opportunity in some of our businesses to capture more revenues and some of that as stephen highlighted is really due to market share gains and we think that will be more sticky some of it is due to the environment theres no question as we looked at our kind of threeyear trajectory and thinking about our desire to run the firm more efficiently that this environment and the crisis slowed down some of the actions we might have taken during this year weve now begun to deal with some things from an efficiency perspective that we might have dealt with earlier in the year and we then have two more years to go through and execute that plan we continue to be very committed to that plan we continue to be very comfortable with that plan we actually think there might be things that weve seen and weve learned that may create more opportunities for us to advance from that plan but at this point our intention is to give you a more detailed granular update when we review our plan in january at the next earnings call i mean stephen is there anything youd want to add to that stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc mike the only thing i would add to davids comment is that i think that on the forward were going to continue to look at strategic value locations as areas where we can grow and develop a number of different businesses particularly the newer ones i would say automation continues to be a priority for us across the whole of the firm automating what goes on in risk and the various control functions and equally automating platforms that have captured the attention of client sets id also say that look its hard to look at one quarter as a spot for efficiency obviously its important to look out the whole year but equally this is a mediumterm journey that were on and i think some of the items that i mentioned that david mentioned will bear fruit in terms of creating greater operating leverage the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 the last thing id say is that we have said on prior earning calls that its important to look at operating expenses in totality because as we continue to build businesses like transaction banking like the consumer business they will be less humanintensive they will be more automated and therefore we move away from the compensation intensity associated with those businesses as a general matter so i think there are number of levers to pull over the mediumterm michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch all right thats helpful and just a followup on glenns asset management question one of the things weve seen with some of the private companies is theyve been slower to rebound given the economic backdrop so any insight you can provide on the private portfolio companies either those facing more like covidrelated pressure or those that arent and if that will have an impact on the pace of monetization stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so as we looked across the portfolio and we did it in the first quarter did it in the second and again did it in the third we look at those that are most acutely impacted by covid their circumstance in some sense hasnt changed and they remain kind of untouched from the downward mark pressure and valuation that we saw in the first and second quarter there are others that have turned the corner as being affected by covid and that is as much a function of where the market is moving where consumers are moving and the like and then there are others that historically have been untouched by this and so i would say we continue to look at it through the frame of covid impact and equally we look obviously at the underlying performance of the business and not exclusively as against public market comparables and the like and by the way this is of course for that part of the private portfolio not otherwise marked given other events that are going on and so that frame remains the same in terms of how we look at that portfolio itself operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning this is manan gosalia on for betsy graseck i wanted to ask on your capital levels i know youve said you expect to manage to about a to cet1 ratio over time but can you speak to where you expect to maintain capital in the nearterm at least until the stress test do you expect to maintain the same buffer over your required minimum as you did this quarter i know you mentioned that you could see strong activity in the markets in with the elections and the market rebound is there more room to be a little bit more nimble and maybe increase exposure and market rwas in the fourth quarter stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so i think weve brought our cet1 ratio to really to sort of fix ourselves in a competitive position in anticipation as i said of the potential for volatility and higher trading over the course of the fourth quarter weve said before and ill say again that we run roughly with a to basis point buffer where within that range we stand obviously at the higher end now is equally a function of volatility from a risk management point of view that is were in a market that is more likely to express higher not lower as and to the the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 extent that that volatility subsides we will see the buffer come down and well adjust again consistent with where we are on the longerterm trend over the medium to longterm the reinforcement of to is more a reflection i think as ive said in the comments of a forward direction to create and as david noted lower stress loss impact in the overall composition of the business meaning as we continue to pursue certain of our strategic initiatives which create more durable feebased revenue lower capital intensity lower balance sheet intensity well be in a position where i think the requirement of us will come down and therefore over the mediumterm well move more in that direction manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you and could you talk a little bit about what youre seeing on the ma advisory front were seeing the announcements come through both your own and the industry ma announcements have been pretty strong in the third quarter can you give us some more color on what youre hearing from corporates and sponsors and how long do you think this increase in announcements can persist into next year david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so theres no question that earlier in the year given the dramatic nature of the start of the pandemic and the uncertainty that persisted ma activity came to a screeching halt and really through the second quarter new announcements and activity levels were quite low stephen made comments with respect to the pickup in our backlog weve seen an increase in activity i think we see an increase in activity and announcements but also an increase in dialogues and i would say that ceo confidence has improved meaningfully in the quarter its still not at the high elevated levels it might have been at the beginning of the year but ceo confidence in the dialogues were having has certainly improved against that backdrop i would expect to see numerous companies trying to take advantage of the opportunity to consolidate and strengthen position i think one of the things thats going on in the crisis is people are seeing that there continues to be efficiency and scale as the world continues to digitize it requires greater investment and that obviously advantages companies with scale so our base case based on what were seeing is that this increase in activity will continue through the rest of the year into but i would say that youve got to be flexible and understand that if for some reason the course of the pandemic or the economic trajectory change some of that confidence thats currently building that could slow down but at the moment activity levels appear quite good operator your next question is from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning and thanks for taking my questions david you referenced that youll be providing an update to the strategic goals and targets that you laid out on the fourth quarter call and you said youre committed you remain committed to those goals so thats encouraging certainly in light of some of the stories weve seen in the press which were a little confusing but i wanted to number one confirm that the thats a refute of the press reports that you all are considering backing away from the targets and also hear how loan and deposit growth experience through has compared to your prepandemic expectations and how long should we think about a headwind the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 from the liquidity the excess liquidity that you guys are holding as a hindrance to nii how temporary is that likely to be thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc okay so a couple of things first and i just want to be very clear about it its one article i saw the article the article was wrong it was incorrect weve never considered changing our targets theres been no discussion about it and so were committed to our targets and were making progress on our targets and so i dont have anything really else to say about the article other than it was incorrect with respect to the second part of your question and im sorry im now on the third part of your question where youre asking about deposits there was something in the middle right stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc ph mel loans david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc oh about stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc just on the brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc lending stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc lending versus our expectations before the david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so when you look at deposits thats right deposit growth and loan growth when you look at deposit growth what id say and we talked about this in last quarters call deposit growth and the acceleration of our ability to attract digital deposits definitely accelerated during this year because of the pandemic faster than we had expected weve obviously been managing that flow and you saw in this quarter based on actions we took that we slowed down the growth in that deposit rate because we had well exceeded what we expected to do from the year at the same point in time when you look at the consumer business which still remains very very small as we entered the pandemic we had the ability to be more controlled on the growth of that portfolio we remain committed to the targets we set out in our investor day in january but it didnt seem as we were entering the pandemic and there was such uncertainty during the bulk of this year that we should be leaning in toward driving those targets my expectation would be if the economic environment continues to improve youll see an the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 improvement in that loan growth as we head into but well continue to monitor that appropriately and cautiously brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thats clear thanks and then when we think about the expense side comp clearly had a big benefit here this quarter is the best way to look at that yeartodate i know the fourth quarter is an important one for when you guys trueup the pool and consider competitive dynamics and the like but any additional color you can provide there and when we think about comp ratio should we think about it net of provision or gross you referred to i think stephen you referred to it net of provision in your prepared remarks but in prior times it was referred to as gross so just wanted to try to square that a bit thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc at a high level so brennan at a high level and stephen may comment on this too but at a high level as we develop different businesses and stephen pointed to this were developing businesses that have a different component of people cost than some of our businesses had had historically and so we always when we set a comp ratio we are always thinking based on the information we have at the time what do we think is necessary to pay our people competitively and protect our franchise pcls are a cost of doing business its a reflection of the capital thats embedded in the business and it obviously affects that judgment in a year where there were very very low pcls the difference between those two ratios is very little in a year where there are very significant pcls given the nature of the time were on the cycle obviously theres a big difference and that will weigh more heavily in those years but we continue to see real operating leverage in our business as we execute on our strategy as things continue to digitize and we continue to automate but in addition we have excellent people in a number of businesses that need to be paid when people perform and well stay very very focused on making sure that were competitively and wellpositioned but youve seen some of the operating leverage come through on the business stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc i mean brennan i would just point out that through three quarters when you look at comp as a percentage of revenue net of provisions we are spot on to where we were last year and so theres obviously no change in philosophy i think david gave you all the reasons why its important that we take stock of provisions in the context of looking at that i would say though more generally its important to focus on the efficiency ratio of the firm over an extended period of time because as i said earlier comp will be inevitably but one component of a set of operating expenses by which the firm is carrying itself and so i think efficiency ratio will be a better indicator of the firms ability to manage but thats not to ignore the focus and the view into comp as an expense and so i think part of what david and i have told you gives you a sense of how were looking at it relative to provisions and where it sits on a yeartodate basis operator your next question is from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities please go ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 great good morning thanks for taking the questions first question just want to touch on the stock for a moment just looking at the stock the price was down yeartodate book value is up about you put 1mdb behind you you get a record eps quarter today and so just want to think a little bit about how you guys talk about the stock price internally you essentially have laid out a transparent plan for the business youve set longterm initiatives that imply a business shift towards higher multiple areas and so im just curious if the mentality is that as you execute on the plan over time the price will just take care of itself or maybe getting to a point where it makes sense to take more of a stand around the stock just given that it has implications for how you run the business david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think devin youve laid this out very well we put out a plan we believe were executing weve got a lot more work to do if we execute i assume the stock will follow and were focused on shareholder value were focused on the medium to longer term and i feel good we feel good as a leadership team as to how were progressing but theres more work to do and our assumption is if we continue to deliver consistently over the medium and longer term shareholders will benefit and the stock price will perform devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay thanks david and then just a followup here on the consumer business there were several changes to leadership in consumer and wealth during the quarter im just curious if that implies any focus and shift in the business or just any color around implications there to strategy or how the business is run david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so theres no focus and strategy or how the business should be run one of the things that i believe very strongly and that weve been driving toward as a management team since we took over as a management team two years ago was getting the way we talk about the business to be set up in a way we could transparently talk about our different big business platforms and to have those businesses aligned with the way we were running the business internally that is not something that traditionally we had we had external segments we had different divisions internally we made segment shifts at the end of last year to set up the platforms the way we expected to run them and the announcements we made now get people who are driving the strategy moving those platforms forward aligned with the way we talk about the businesses to you to the investment community to our shareholders and we feel thats an important step forward so theres no change but rather just a continuation of the journey weve been on to get the firm lined up and set up now with these four big platforms that we really think we can drive growth over time stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc devin the only thing i would add just to touch on the specifics of performance within the consumer business so overall the marcus unsecured loans closed the quarter at a lower balance than where it began the year and apple card balances were higher than where we ended the year both of those very purposeful in the context of managing through a young portfolio in an uncertain moment with respect to the consumer the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 i would also say that the loss behavior if you will or the credit behavior of that portfolio is outperforming our modeled expectations that is losses have been coming down relative to that which was otherwise budgeted or forecasted which is as much of a function of how weve managed underwriting on the entry how weve managed customers under customer assistant plans and the like and so that just gives you a sense of where performance lies in the context of davids comments operator your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i think my question is rooted in my business school class when i read in search of excellence and it says stick to your knitting im not sure if you recall that old book and maybe its just too ancient but when i look at your business the capital markets side i mean youre clearly gaining wallet share it reminds of when you were successful in supporting your customers through the last recession and on the other hand the expansion businesses buying into credit cards one concern i hear is youre just buying into a lower pe activity you certainly seem committed on that debt strategy but it seems like theres still questions there so specific questions on the side where theres a lot more confidence the legacy businesses of capital markets your ma backlog how does that compare to the alltime high and trading by how much has the wallet share gain been due to the environment because vix is so high versus new business so thats on the positive side and on the less confident side the growth what do you bring when you buy a credit card that the seller wasnt providing before thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so there was a lot there mike and so if i i appreciate all the questions if i dont get them all i just want to highlight i dont remember the book because i didnt go to business school but as i try to tick through and answer first on ma backlog and i think stephen said this while ma backlog strengthened during the quarter its not back to where it was at the beginning of the year and its certainly not at its alltime high with respect to market share gains in global markets i think the market share gains we believe as a management team that the market share gains are rooted in an evolution back of our strategy to really being very very clientcentric a one gs approach and really trying to think about how we as an organization deliver for our clients in a very central way and this is core to the way were running the whole firm its been a big initiative over the last two years and we think its having a real impact in the way our clients interact with us and our ability to serve our clients and we think thats helping our market shares certainly the volume levels i think at this moment in time are elevated the overall activity levels are elevated to some degree based on the pandemic and the volatility in markets but i think the market share is coming from the way were executing a strategy and we began that focus well before covid we began that focus two years ago and i think were really getting results from that investment the third thing with respect to the credit card business its hard to imagine wherein any business that has a lower pe than the current pe that we trade at but when you look at our vision for what were trying to do in building a digital consumer platform that marries our strong expertise in wealth while also providing a digital experience for general banking services for consumers were committed to it we believe in it but we want to be perfectly clear this is something thats going to be built over a long period of time just like we now sit today with an the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 extraordinary asset management franchise where we have over trillion of assets under supervision thats been built over a very long period of time and we believe its really accretive to the value of goldman sachs and our shareholders over a very long period of time and so were going to continue to work at this cautiously i know theres skepticism out there were going to prove over time as to why we think its right well continue to advance it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and im going to ask you a question thats not really your responsibility but it goes back to the earlier question on a day like today and last quarter the market seems to be giving you a pe of or even less on your earnings and i think theres a disconnect between the lumpiness of your capital markets revenues with the annuitylike nature of your customer relationships so im not sure if theres any way that you could put in context the recurring nature of the bulk of the capital markets activity even while parts are lumpy and thats i think some shareholders are very frustrated as it was reflected by the earlier question and so i know your view is look stock prices follow earnings youve had a focus on growing book value lets grow book value and everything else will take care of itself is that still the way you think about that david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think your last statement is true but ill make a couple of other comments at a high level and it would offer a perspective and i know mike youd have a perspective on this too but for sure were going to continue to focus on performing and i think over time it will take care of itself at a high level the banking sector and financials broadly are well outoffavor and so its not as though were sitting in a unique position if you look at the people that you would benchmark us against and you look at how they trade on a relative basis people are pretty clustered in the neighborhood is that something that i think is permanent no i dont think its permanent can you and i both speculate as to reasons why people feel that way at this point in the cycle and with some of the uncertainty absolutely i do think to your point the client franchise and the capital markets revenues that we have are if youre looking at it not quarter to quarter but over periods of time as a franchise business there is volatility in it compared to some businesses but over any meaningful period of time they generate lots of revenues lots of earnings very consistently so part of it depends on the frame through which you look and we could certainly go back over long periods of time and see how the client franchise and the strength of the client franchise continues to do well so we really believe when we focus on clients that revenue will be sustained in the context of the market opportunity as a business we operate in a business that might have more shortterm volatility than some other businesses that are out there that people benchmark in some way i think its an interesting time because of the pandemic and the uncertainty so i think that hurts the overall neighborhood but i continue to believe that we have big platforms we have scale we have leadership positions those things are sticky the things that we do are not going to go away and if we focus on our clients and delivering for shareholders over time i believe the stock price will follow stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc mike an interesting development just to amplify on davids comment which is that even in the trading businesses which one could argue are volatile in the context of the market on certain of the electronic platforms the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 that were seeing and i would speak specifically about the credit platform we are seeing an increasing number of our clients come to those platforms transact on those platforms now that may be a function of work from home and the disposition of those clients but were seeing a growing presence their attachment to those platforms whether its marquee or otherwise is sticky and tends to stay there perhaps even more than what you might see in a hightouch versus lowtouch and getting into that in the business that you would not otherwise expect to be as predictable if you will i think is just something to take note in the context of your question operator your next question is from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks a quick question on the cet1 ratio i know there was kind of meaningful reduction in the rwas quarteronquarter and then i heard you talk about some of the environment just being probably seasonality impacting that but can you guys tease out the change in the rwa between what was more seasonality activity versus where you actively managed those rwas lower to ensure you got over your icb minimums stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so i think on one hand if you look on a yearoveryear basis its a question of volatility so wed see it higher than not by virtue of volatility otherwise on a quarteronquarter basis you see the positional set change reduced exposure certain diversification effect which plays to the positive so there was no meaningful uptick in risk in the context of where rwa deployment otherwise was brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then when you think about the cet1 ratio targets that youre running to obviously that assumes the scb would improve for you from here so what are kind of some of the actions that youre taking for it to get the scb lower so that you can run at a to with a management buffer over the nearterm stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure well i think over the mediumterm i think if you look at the various initiatives that we articulated at investor day and are executing on now whether it is transaction banking the consumer business what were doing with respect to our alt business all of those will reduce the stress loss intensity of our business overall transaction banking will be a feegenerating proposition the alternatives business equally will give us a more durable thread of fees and at the same time take down the capital and balance sheet intensity that otherwise weighs on the capital calculation so i think all of those are geared with an eye toward reducing down as i said stress loss intensity and ultimately leading to a lower scb itself operator your next question is from the line of jim mitchell with seaport please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 hey good morning i appreciate the commentary around ma and maybe the spillover impact on acquisition finance but if we think about whats been going on this year in terms of significant capital raising both equity dcm how do we think about that going forward it sounds like youve replenished some of the coffer in terms of the pipeline how much demand is there to shore up balance sheets and for capital markets activity or is it kind of a yin and a yang where ma picks up and capital raising comes down and we dont really grow banking much just trying to think through that level of activity david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so jim i think its a hard thing to look at and predict with granularity theres no question that the environment pulled forward both pulled forward some financing for companies and also created a whole bunch of financing that if we didnt have this environment it wouldnt have happened and so theres no question that financing levels have been elevated during this year at the same point in time if again and this goes back to my point as people think about this if we get out of the mode of kind of thinking quarter to quarter to quarter and we look at these as huge franchises we have leading share and were wellpositioned i believe over any period of time years years years years theres going to be enormous corporate financing activity and we will have leading share in participating in that and that will be a big profitable business that will enhance our franchise and help drive earnings growth and book value growth and so in the shortterm its hard for me to speculate i mean i would speculate that if things normalize which i expect them to we will not see the same velocity of financing in that we saw in as people try to adapt and finance themselves out to create more runway given the uncertainty and environment and so again big franchise big opportunity and whatever the market puts forward i think were wellpositioned to serve our clients and capture it james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc well maybe as a followup too on that just maybe you could update us on your efforts to kind of expand market share you talked about going downmarket into the middle market how has the progress been on that david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i appreciate that question jim the progress is going quite well and i think one of the things that i know is self evident to everybody on the call as market cap grows there are more and more companies that grow into being worth million billion billion that have never been on our radar screen so that footprint has expanded meaningfully and theres been hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue accretion based on the opportunity set thats come from that and i think that will continue so i feel good about the way that platform expansion is going and i think there continues to be more opportunity for us over time to continue to add to that footprint operator you have a followup question from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 hi what is your appetite for asset management acquisitions along with that i know you mentioned roe and rotce youve always been very cognizant of having a lot of goodwill and you dont have so much so whats your appetite for asset management deals and whats your appetite for goodwill and do you still have the same focus on roe as much as ever david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i think mike that im not going to say anything in response to this thats different to what i said just a few minutes ago were making investments to grow our asset management business organically certainly the strategy weve laid out and alternatives and the mix shift and the way were approaching that is an organic effort we certainly are aware of the continued consolidation thats going on in the asset management industry we feel very wellpositioned as a very very large global broad and deep active asset manager as opportunities come up well consider them if we think they can enhance our franchise and allow us to expand the strength of our franchise and our ability to serve our institutional clients and also individual clients through our wealth business to the degree that we thought something would really enhance our ability to drive that platform we would take on the goodwill that was necessary to do it were not afraid of that we havent seen the right opportunity for us at the moment and so well continue to grow the business organically if the right thing came along inorganically we take a very hard look at it stephen m scherr chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc okay since there are no more questions in the queue id like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team we look forward to speaking with many of you in the
