carey and good morning everyone thank you all for joining us this quarter we produced net revenues of billion and generated earnings per share of an roe of and an rote of our results were impacted by several items related to businesses where were executing on a strategic transition and positioning the firm for the future in particular our asset wealth management business to a less capital intensive model and the pivot to narrow our consumer ambition allin these items reduced our eps for the second quarter by and our roe by percentage points our results were also impacted by the challenging macro environment and in particular headwinds facing our specific mix of businesses activity levels in many areas of investment banking hover near decadelong lows and clients largely maintained a riskoff posture over the course of the quarter ceos around the world continue to be cautious as businesses grapple with persistent inflation geopolitical tensions and slower growth but we know the corporate activity and capital formation are core to our financial system and there are a number of structural catalysts that should lead to increased levels of activity and were seeing it begin to pick up in a few spots already particularly equity capital markets and ma dialogue theres no question recent economic data in the us indicates the feds efforts to fight inflation are showing progress and we are starting to see more optimism about the forward trajectory however the year unfolds we stand ready to help our clients navigate the evolving backdrop while maintaining a prudent risk posture and operating the firm more efficiently importantly we laid out a clear set of strategic goals at our investor day in february and we are in execution mode we have two incredibly strong client franchises a worldclass global banking markets business where the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 we continue to deliver solid returns even in an environment with reduced activity levels and a scaled asset wealth management platform that continues to show very strong underlying trends aligned with our investor day goals with growth in more recurring revenues of management and other fees and private banking and lending these businesses are supported by a number of things first a long track record of serving the worlds leading businesses institutions and individuals building relationships as a trusted advisor is core to what goldman sachs does next the clientcentric mindset over the last five years weve strengthened our efforts to bring to bear the best of the firms capabilities and holistically serve clients with our one goldman sachs operating ethos client feedback continues to be highly encouraging and we see opportunities to make further gains we also have a global broad and deep platform with capabilities that span across products geographies and solutions a key differentiator of value for our clients around the world we have exceptional people theyre differentiated and they work hard to make a difference for our clients and lastly this is all underpinned by a culture of collaboration and excellence we are also pleased that our strategy to reduce the capital intensity of our business is resulting in sustained multiyear progress starting in october our scb will be reduced by basis points to giving us greater flexibility to deploy our capital we continue to execute on the billion share repurchase program we announced in february and we recently announced a increase to our quarterly dividend we have made it a priority to grow our dividend to a competitive rate and since the beginning of we have more than tripled our dividend from to per share per quarter given our ongoing strategic efforts to lower the firms capital density and reduce earnings volatility we are well positioned to grow it further as i said we are laserfocused on executing on our strategy this moment in the economic cycle creates meaningful headwinds for goldman sachs and our business mix at the same time we are making tough decisions that are driving the strategic evolution of the firm given both these factors it should come as no surprise that were going through a period of lower results i remain fully confident that we will deliver on our throughthecycle targets of midteens returns and create significant value for shareholders ill now turn it over to denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail denis p coleman chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david good morning lets start with our results on page of the presentation in the second quarter we generated net revenues of billion and net earnings of billion resulting in earnings per share of as david mentioned we have provided additional detail this quarter on three items that impacted our results these items area gain in connection with our sale process for the marcus unsecured loan portfolio as well as the business operating results losses from our historical principal investments within asset wealth management and results relating to greensky including a goodwill impairment in consumer platforms in aggregate for the second quarter these three items impacted net earnings by billion and reduced our eps by and our roe by percentage points turning to performance by segment starting on page global banking markets produced revenues of billion in the second quarter advisory revenues of million were down versus a strong prioryear period amid the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 significantly lower industry completions equity underwriting revenues rose yearoveryear to million as we saw some signs of reopening in the capital markets although volumes continue to remain well below medium and longterm averages debt underwriting revenues were slightly down versus the second quarter of as activity remains muted nonetheless our client franchise remains very strong and we remain wellpositioned to support the needs of our clients we ranked number one in the league tables across announced and completed ma as well as equity underwriting and highyield debt on a yeartodate basis additionally our backlog rose quarteronquarter primarily in advisory ficc net revenues were billion in the quarter as clients remained in a riskoff posture relative to an active prioryear quarter particularly in commodities rates and currencies ficc financing revenues were million equities net revenues were billion in the quarter roughly flat yearonyear equities financing revenues were a record billion as we benefited from our ongoing strategic focus and increased balances this was largely offset by a decline in intermediation revenues primarily in derivatives our strategic priority to grow financing across both ficc and equities continues to yield results as these activities increase the durability of our revenue base and we continue to see attractive deployment opportunities to support further growth moving to asset wealth management on page revenues of billion were down yearoveryear primarily driven by weaker results in equity and debt investments management and other fees increased yearover year to a record billion largely driven by higher assets under supervision private banking and lending revenues were also a record at million we continue to see positive momentum in this business as we benefit from higher deposit balances and nii results were supported by a gain of approximately million related to the sale of substantially all the remaining marcus loans portfolio equity investments generated losses of million more specifically we had roughly million of net losses in our private portfolio primarily due to markdowns on investments in officerelated commercial real estate and approximately million of net losses in our public portfolio largely driven by a loss related to a historical principal investment that we sold out of during the quarter importantly we have now reduced the public portfolio to approximately billion down from more than billion in debt investments revenues were million with the yearoveryear decline driven by weaker performance in real estate investments this quarter we also experienced approximately million of impairments on our real estaterelated cie portfolio which are reflected in operating expenses in aggregate the results from marcus loans and the losses from our historical principal investments negatively impacted our margins for the segment by approximately percentage points for the first half of the year now moving to page total firmwide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record trillion driven by billion of market appreciation as well as billion of longterm net inflows representing our 22nd consecutive quarter of longterm feebased inflows turning now to page on alternatives alternative assets under supervision totaled billion at the end of the second quarter driving million in management and other fees for the quarter gross thirdparty fundraising was billion for the quarter and billion for the first half of the year total thirdparty fundraising since our investor day is now over billion and remain very wellpositioned to achieve our target of billion the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 onbalance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately billion of which billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio in the second quarter we reduced this portfolio by billion which included sales of a number of crerelated investments bringing yeartodate reductions to approximately billion and putting us well on pace to achieve our yearend target of a historical principal investment portfolio below billion next platform solutions on page revenues were million driven by growth in loan balances in consumer platforms as noted earlier we took a million impairment charge on the goodwill associated with consumer platforms this quarter in connection with our exploration of a potential sale of the greensky business we will continue to evaluate its intangibles for impairment and should we decide to sell the business we will also make a determination regarding moving greensky to heldforsale similar to the action we took last quarter with respect to our marcus unsecured loan portfolio we will share further updates as appropriate additionally you will recall that in our investor day earlier this year we said that we expected to reduce the efficiency ratio in platform solutions below by the end of this year and we are making progress absent the impact of the goodwill impairment in consumer platforms the efficiency ratio for this segment yeartodate would have been better than our stated goal on page firmwide net interest income was billion in the second quarter our total loan portfolio at quarter end was billion unchanged versus the prior quarter for the second quarter our provision for credit losses was million provisions in the quarter were primarily due to continued growth and higher net chargeoffs in our lending portfolio within consumer platforms additionally within our wholesale portfolio impairments and a reserve build were partially offset by releases due to lower balances moving on to page weve added a new slide this quarter providing additional detail on our cre exposure starting with the left side of the page cre loans represent a relatively small percentage of our overall lending book roughly and we are welldiversified by property type with only in the office category moving to the right side of the page you can see additional detail on our crerelated onbalance sheet alternative investments we conducted a comprehensive asset by asset review of this portfolio this quarter and weve incorporated the feedback from our selldown process officerelated exposure represents approximately of the aggregate portfolio in equity securities loans and debt securities and approximately of the cie investments and other category net of financings overall the cre investments are diversified across geographies and positions with no single position representing more than of the total onbalance sheet alternative investments furthermore of these investments are historical principal investments that we intend to exit over the mediumterm we continue to remain highly focused on the overall risk management of this portfolio turning to expenses on page total quarterly operating expenses were billion our yeartodate compensation ratio net of provisions is which includes approximately million of yeartodate severance costs at investor day in february we articulated a goal of million in run rate payroll efficiencies to be achieved this year and we have now largely reached this target with line of sight to surpass it quarterly noncompensation expenses were billion the increase in our noncompensation expense was entirely driven by the cie and goodwill impairments i discussed previously absent these items noncomp expense is down for the second consecutive quarter even in the face of inflationary headwinds our effective tax the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 rate for the first half of was largely as a result of an increase in taxes on nonus earnings for the full year we expect a tax rate of roughly next capital on slide our common equity tier ratio was at the end of the second quarter under the standardized approach which is basis points over our new requirement that will become applicable in october as david mentioned we are pleased with the results of the recent stress test and remain confident that our strategy to reduce the capital density of our business will continue to help improve our scb over time the basis point reduction in our scb will allow us to continue to remain nimble in dynamically deploying capital to support our client franchise in the quarter weve returned billion to shareholders including common stock repurchase of million and common stock dividends of million our board has also approved a increase in our dividend to per share beginning in the third quarter this increase will enable us to pay our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and maintain a competitive yield complemented by our previously announced billion share repurchase program where we intend to stepup the level of buybacks going forward in conclusion our second quarter results reflect a challenging backdrop as well as our ongoing execution of several strategic actions these initiatives will help transition our business and improve our overall return profile we remain confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for goldman sachs with that well now open up the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well go first to glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thank you so i want to talk about how we build towards the mediumterm roe target so obviously for this quarter it was depressed by the writedowns lets start with a 9ish starting point we know capital markets activity will be better in normal times so i know were a lot closer than it looks right now if you look at page where indiscernible you spelled out the billion of historical principal investments that declined in the quarter or if you want to do it yeartodate either way my question related to that reducing capital intensity is in a good way it didnt look like there was a big gain or a loss related to those exits a is that right and b how much capital ph or rwa did you free up because im just trying to build towards that ultimate goal thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so glenn thank you for the question and i think in terms of our journey towards our throughthecycle returns there are a number of things that we need to do in terms of achieving the top line targets that we laid out at investor day as well as continuing to drive ongoing capital efficiency the capital efficiency has been a project that weve been working on for a number of years weve had particular increases in those reductions over both the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 the first and second quarter as you note about hpi down billion and as we if we ultimately reach our target we expect the total ae reduction to be approximately billion and david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah glenn i just want to add two things just in looking at that because denis was focused on the ae and the continued journey the one thing he didnt touch on was your question around the reductions and whether there were meaningful marks around that there are some where youd reduce where it might be a public position so we mark those public positions at market that night and you sell that position at a discount so there could be a slight loss there are others that are private positions where you keep a valuation adjustment or a discount to what you believe its worth and you sell it and youll get a gain but i wouldnt say theres anything material that id call out in the context of that process but the important thing about the journey that id like to emphasize is we laid out clearly at investor day that we were going to narrow the consumer ambitions and really focus on these two big businesses clearly at this point in time given the lack of investment banking activity our investment banking business is performing at a lower level of return and a lower level of activity than weve seen in nearly a decade we dont believe thats constant we believe that that global markets banking sic global banking markets business can deliver midteens return through the cycle and that obviously makes up more than twothirds of the firm in addition marc nachmann laid out at our investor day a very clear path on asset management to grow the top line of asset management ex the legacy balance sheet by a high singledigit percentage and we set a target to drive the margin which ex the legacy balance sheet up to at that point that is a midteens return business and as we continue to narrow the drag which were making progress on in the platforms and i believe well narrow that to zero and move past that youve got these two businesses that are the firm that will be midteens through the cycle and so thats the way id think about it but obviously you need a better environment than this environment to see that glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate all that and maybe one just big picture i think a lot of the banks that investment banks that have reporter over the last couple of days have had varying degrees of optimism about capital markets activity returning and i think in typical goldman fashion you all have been i think appropriately conservative over the last couple of quarters so maybe ill just get marktomarket on what green shoots you may or may not be seeing you mentioned your advisory pipeline was up ph just like kind of contextualize that thatd be great david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure id say glenn the following it definitely feels better over the course of the last six to eight weeks than it felt earlier in the year and ive talked in the past on this call and other times when ive talked to many of you about the fact that when you have a big reset it takes five or six quarters to get that reset its not surprising that were kind of at six quarters now and youre starting to see more activity so theres definitely been a pickup in equity capital markets activity that definitely feels better theres more ma dialogue i cant tell you exactly what the journey is but when i go back and i look historically at other periods where the macro environment has created sharp drops in investment banking activity they tend to last for a year or so and the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 then they start to improve and so i think were starting to see that here it definitely feels better i think the inflation data has been better the client sentiment is better and now well have to watch and see that journey but i know this activity level of 10year lows in investment banking activity is not going to be the normal on a forward basis operator thank you well take our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess maybe just a first question when we think about potential for obviously pickup in the back half david as you just mentioned but give us a sense of rightsizing the business given the slowdown that weve seen over the last year or so are we there head countwise infrastructurewise where you wanted to be on the expense base and as we anchor back to the efficiency target around just give us a sense of how you think we get there and where goldman is today in terms of just rightsizing the expense base david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so i think we ill make a couple of comments and denis will probably add on with some more granular detail but i think weve made progress we set out some targets at the beginning of the year as you heard in denis prepared remarks we have them basically accomplished and in line of sight for more youve seen our noncomp expense ex these extraordinary items around impairments have been down for the second quarter in a row weve been very focused on that and theres been real work done there because theres certainly inflationary pressure on a bunch of the line items in our noncomp expenses i think that with hindsight im very glad that we were early in january starting to work on the head count sizing we took a couple of actions so far this year and we feel good about where we are id remind everybody and weve said this before that we are resuming our regular performancebased process that we do with compensation at the end of the year which we had stopped during the pandemic and start it again next year so when we go through compensation we will do a performance review but we have no other specific plans on the head count now well watch the trajectory of revenues and the environment as we go forward well always make adjustments if something changes but as we just said we think were operating in extraordinarily low activities of investment banking were not going to erode that franchise that is the key franchise of the firm so this is a moment that we probably have to support that a little bit more as things recover we obviously are focused on a bunch of efficiency uplift ph in processes and operations we have a big project going on to make some investments that can create more automation and technology and we feel good about that so we think that over time thats not a or early thing but we think over time thats something else that will benefit the trajectory denis do you have some specifics to add denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i mean just to add for you so end of the second quarter we ended head count was its down about on the quarter about yeartodate i think the more comparable metric is probably the yearover year metric of down because well have new joiners in the third quarter but as david said were happy about the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 taking the action early in the year positioning the firm appropriately and also pleased that weve been able to reach towards our target of million in run rate payroll efficiencies ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just maybe a quick followup i think if i heard you correctly you mentioned goal to maybe step up pace of buybacks in the back half if you could maybe put some numbers around that what level of buybacks we should expect and how big a deal is the fed basel npr from what were hearing it may take months before we know what the final rules when they incorporate industry feedback look like so how big of an unknown that is in terms of your capital deployment plans denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so you have pieces of the answer to the question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yes denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc ph before my answer so what we would say obviously very pleased with the ccar results we have basis points of cushion we intend to deploy some of that excess capital into the client franchise to continue to grow our activities there we announced our increase in dividend we remain very committed to sustainably growing our dividend and were going to increase our level of buybacks we are mindful of basel iii revisions but we also recognize that well get a rule therell be a comment period for the rule therell be a period in which thats implemented some suggestions in the beginning of that implementation may even have a phasein period so as we think about the way in which we manage capital we think we should be optimizing for our client franchise and for our shareholders we obviously will make sure were in a position to adopt any new guidance and to do so on time and early but in the intervening period were going to continue to manage our capital to grow the firm and to deliver returns of capital to shareholders and we thought we would indicate that that intention is to step it up from where we are operator thank you well take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 so david theres been a fair amount of press speculation covering how your the consumer business specifically even some recently suggesting you might look to sell some additional receivables tied to a partnership with apple and gm i know press speculation might not be representative of whats actually being discussed so it might be helpful just to hear about your strategic priorities for the consumer business maybe how your vision has evolved in recent months just given some of the challenges facing that business and maybe not fitting with your aligning with your core competencies david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so thanks for the question and id frame it this way as i think you know we made difficult but appropriate decisions over a year ago working with our board to narrow our consumer ambitions and kind of rolled out ph in the fall the direction of travel and have been executing on that and that included the winddown and the execution of the marcus the winddown and the execution of the sale of the marcus loan portfolio which has now been completed and obviously exploring options for greensky which weve been transparent on and are in the process of weve also said very clearly that our credit card partnerships are longterm partnerships we dont have unilateral rights with them they definitely can operate better weve been working hard to improve the operation of them which will reduce the drag and were making good progress on that and were working with apple and also with gm to do that and so theres significant focus on reducing that drag and the drag of those credit card partnerships has gotten smaller and it will continue to be reduced as we move forward into we continue to have a very strong deposit platform we launched a apple savings platform which also was a successful launch that grew our deposit base and so well continue to grow deposits and thats the course that were on at the moment steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no thats great color so thanks for all of that david maybe just for my followup on equity financing specifically the contribution in the first half actually implies an incremental billion in fees yearonyear youve definitely been highlighting the commitment to grow the financing piece i just wanted to better understand one the durability of the gains that you saw in the first half and as we look out over the next few years how significant of a contribution to the trading business do you expect from the financing component both across equities as well as ficc david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so im going to start with a high level just strategic view of what i think weve done and were focused on doing and then denis will give you a little bit more detail but one of the things this has been a strategic priority for us because i certainly remember going back over the last decade there were times when we did not have the largest equity business and we were not in the position with our clients in the equity franchise that were in now and there were some reasons based on strategic decisions that we made at the time but weve been very focused over the last decade in improving that position and have made good progress and growing the financing franchise and also expanding the base of clients that we worked with there has made a real difference and so i look at the equities performance this quarter and feel very good about it very good about what the teams accomplished and very good about the feedback we get from clients now broadly that the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 financing revenue is more durable than intermediation revenue but it obviously is affected by riskon riskoff and overall marketlevel activities and so there can be variability in it but theres a base stability there thats much more meaningful than intermediation revenues denis can expand a little bit more on how we think about that from a risk and a capital perspective denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so that is the strategic direction of travel we are allocating a lot of time and resources human capital financial capital to grow those activities equities financing revenues are nearly of overall equities revenues this quarter and thats something that has been growing even the combined ficc and equities financing as a percentage of ficc and equities continue to grow so we remain very focused on prioritizing activities in that space with clients and were also observing that theres a virtuous reinforcement of our commitments to grow market share and to cover clients more holistically over a multiyear period its paying dividends both across dividend and intermediation and recognizing davids comments with respect to market valuation levels which drive changes in balances and changes in behavior theres also activities that weve been taking to sort of systematically identify components of the client base across the financing activities and make sure that were capturing more share in underpenetrated portions of the client base so we remain committed to growing that activity its relatively more durable than intermediation but like other line items it can fluctuate on the forward operator thank you well go next to betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey just one followup to that last question and then a different one but just on the last question so you mentioned durability when you were talking about financing that was part of what i wanted to understand do you feel like this quarter of financing revenue is a good jumpoff point for us to grow from and if theres any puts takes on how you would think how would you want us to think about that level of durability that would be helpful thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 sure so ill comment both on ficc and equities in fixed income we had slightly softer performance periodon period that was driven by a component of ficc financing which is more episodic which is commoditiesbased financing those activity levels were a lot higher and so i think you see lack of contribution from commodities based financing activity that was in prior periods but i think the forward for other components of our ficc financing like collateralized lending and repo i think there remains opportunity for us to deploy and continue to grow those types of activities always cautious about predicting growth off of record performance were pleased with the equities financing performance in the second quarter and we do intend to grow that from here but well have to continue to work hard to continue to deliver the type of periodoverperiod growth but we do think theres still unaddressed market share and we continue to grow our balances to grow those revenues betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and you highlighted capital obviously have excess significant excess so theres that flex between buybacks versus deploy this is an opportunity to deploy i guess the followup i had to that was in your comments earlier on the basel iii endgame i think you mentioned that you look youre in a position to be opportunistic whether or not you want to meet the requirements early and i guess that was the question i had on when you say on time of course but early just meaning within that phasein period early and again i kind of ask the question with the context of youve got this opportunity in financing so how should i think through meeting it early versus leaning into financing versus other options you might have thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah betsy so look i appreciate that i think theres a lot thats unknown about the direction of travel on this and were talking about years out and so i think denis message on early was in the context of the phasein period making sure we were getting there on time but no we are focused on deploying we generate a lot of capital because the firm generally through the cycle generates good earnings we are going to return a bunch of that to shareholders and there are opportunities as were talking about to deploy that in service of ph clients given the work weve done strategically we now have much greater flexibility which gives us the option to look sharply at some of the deployment opportunities where maybe to months ago we thought we needed to be more cautious and at the same point we have more capacity as denis said to step up buybacks you should view that were very very focused on delivering capital to serve clients and to shareholders and well be very thoughtful about the adjustment phasein of whatever comes when we understand it but id just say theres a lot of uncertainty its a ways out theres going to be comment periods and so theres nothing going to be premature about what we do operator thank you well go next to mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi look i think you described here the rightsizing ph with investment equity debt cie the consumer and with head count i guess the specific question is what were any severance charges in the quarter and where are you on the rightsizing on head count and the big picture question for david is simply is this as bad as it gets do you feel comfortable that youve captured everything with from any severance to ph marcus to greensky the cies ph the debt and equity investments that youre conservative the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 enough are we going to keep seeing roes or does this accelerate your journey to that midterm roe thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc okay mike its denis ill start and then ill turn it over to david so we called out our severance expense yearto date which is million the vast majority of that was in the first quarter in connection with much larger levels of head count reductions then the reason that were making an effort to call it out you will also notice that our comp ratio net of provisions is at were just making an effort to provide transparency in terms of what components of our compensation expense accruals are designed for severance and we think thats important because with the balance were going to be focused on our payforperformance ethos as well as balancing returns for shareholders but making sure that we have the capacity this year to protect our talent protect the franchise make sure were positioned to capture the upside so the severance disclosures are just designed to help understand the financial impact of the actions weve taken david will give you more color but weve largely done what we set out to do were on target for the payroll efficiencies and thatll help you understand what the severance picture is relative to the overall accrued level of compensation and expense david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc and mike to your bigger question this was a meaningful quarter in putting some things that we strategically decided to do behind us with respect to the balance sheet i think one of the things thats very important to call out this is an environment at the moment thats been hard on that legacy balance sheet we are reducing the legacy balance sheet but we could just as well next quarter if the environment improves have positive revenues from that legacy balance sheet too but if the environment got worse we still have balance sheet to reduce so ive been around the firm a long time this was obviously a tough quarter but we also had oneoff items that weve put in were going to continue to give you transparency on the legacy balance sheet and were going to continue to move forward i think the environment feels better if the environment feels better and the environment turns out to be better youll see better performance but i feel very very good about the strategic decisions that were making the execution that were working on the progress were making in asset wealth management and we as a leadership team see a clear path to improvement in a better operating environment mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and can you remind us so youre taking this pain the charges and youre looking to get to midteens roe in the mediumterm how do you define mediumterm and what should we be looking at along the way because to the extent that this accelerates this transition itd be nice to see some metrics externally for that progress david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well were going to make progress mike over the next couple of years the next two to three years were going to make meaningful progress but id just highlight when you go back to our core business banking markets where we are a leader and i think given the mix of that business its performing well in whats not a perfect environment for that business if that business we really believe will deliver midteens through the cycle the the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 investment banking returns right now are at a very very significant low but we do have a roe todate in global banking markets so an improved environment should help us the asset management journey is going to take and we were very clear about this in february its going to take two to three more years for us to continue to make progress on the journey with respect to the continued reduction of the balance sheet and the revenue growth and the margin uplift and were working on it we see a clear line of sight and were going to make progress operator thank you well go next to brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions you spoke earlier to green shoots that youre seeing in the banking side given how important sponsors are to your banking franchise curious to drill down and specifically understand what youre seeing with that cohort and whether or not we need to see the levered loan market recover before they can come back in full force thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so thanks for that question brennan its a good question its an important thing im glad youre asking us to highlight it because i think about it this way and its very very important when you look at our ma business a significant contributor to our ma business is ma for sponsors and thats come to a halt its come to a halt there are two aspects of it theres buysides and theres sellsides the buysides obviously also give us financing and other capital markets activity the sellsides sometimes give ph staple and financing opportunity too but that stuffs kind of come to a halt heres one thing i know about financial sponsors number one they own bunch of assets theyre all for sale and they all will be sold this environment has slowed down the pace of sale in a better environment that will accelerate and i think were going to see that accelerate as we look forward from here this has been a particularly slow environment for that secondly they have enormous dry powder okay and they cant make money unless they deploy and so as soon as you get to a place that values reset and financing costs are understood you start to see people deploy it were starting to see some of that you saw this quarter obviously a very very big transaction around fis and so youre going i think to see more as we move forward so this is a very very important part of the investment banking ecosystem that kind of came to a shutdown given the volatility of change in the environment and im not smart enough to tell you this quarter next quarter but it will meaningfully improve and its an important component to investment banking activity and its one of the reasons why investment banking activity is running at kind of from an activity level kind of 10year lows denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc and the other part of your question brendon sic brennan speaks to availability and health of financing markets i think we certainly have underwriting appetite to facilitate these transactions and we believe we can distribute risk into the market theres also a number of ph principling buckets both with our clients and within our own funds that are capable of deploying financing to support transaction activity in this environment that could also be an attractive source of activity for the firm the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for all that color i appreciate it and then for my second you started the process of selling greensky we saw the goodwill impairment whats been the reception to that asset and has that impacted your expectation for how quickly you could finalize that sale thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so brennan in terms of the process were obviously in the middle of the process we have feedback i think extra color just to share with you in terms of how you think about potential on the forward its a business we bought for billion we integrated it into goldman sachs were seeing it perform well its a good business we have made the decision to explore alternatives because its not the right fit necessarily for goldman sachs weve written down the goodwill on the consumer platforms segment theres no more goodwill to be written down that business at this point has remaining unamortized intangibles of approximately million that we consider for impairment on a quarterly basis and well do so on the future and should we move forward with a transaction with respect to greensky it could happen in a number of different ways we could sell the platform we could sell the platform and the historical lending book that we have on balance sheet and should we choose to sell the loan book well designate that as heldforsale much like the marcus loans process and youll see the pl impact accordingly as we mark the loans and release the associated reserve so those are the types of things that could occur on the forward given the strategic activity but i dont think theres anything else to say about the greensky process given where we are operator thank you well go next to devin ryan with jmp securities devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc thank you good morning so in markets we hit on financing so just want to look at intermediation here and obviously results were off quite a bit from a great quarter last year but based on the results it also looks like you did better than the implication on the conference circuit late in the quarter so just the implication there would be that june got a lot better for intermediation so just want to make sure kind of that read is correct and then did june feel like a more normal month relative to the first couple and has that continued just trying to think about the quarter and the cadence there thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so thanks devin id just say and you highlighted this appropriately just pointing back i mean one of the big differences when you look at the yearoveryear comparison is we were coming out of the period where the war had started in russia and there was enormous activity in the commodity space and we were very very well positioned to serve clients in that space and so we if you go back and you look at the second quarter we way outperformed in that quarter because of that commodities activity and obviously didnt have that here i think to the second part of your comment yes june was better i think june was definitely better and so there was an improvement in tone and a little bit of improvement in riskon and look were early in the quarter but theres no question theres more of a riskon sentiment in the month of july than there was earlier in the second the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 quarter and you just think about it we were coming out of march we were coming out of the banking crisis and you think about when we were on this call in early april we were in a very different place in terms of investor sentiment overall so there has been an improvement through the quarter and i think its noted appropriately devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay thats great and then just on transaction banking and the momentum there itd be great to just get an update on some of the kind of the drivers and really the question is its such a huge market as you guys identified when you got into the business its still a very small driver for goldman and so just trying to think about the growth there and are there opportunities for more stepfunction growth if you add a certain capability or just how should we think about the opportunity to really this to become a much bigger business for goldman david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so appreciate that question i think youre right i think weve got an interesting platform its been very constructive in bringing deposits to goldman sachs but one of the things that we said over the last couple of quarters is were working now on getting the clients that are on the platform to really get more of their payments activity into the flow so that it delivers real revenue and real value over time thats taking some time and it will take some time i think its ph a dispersed where there are lots of providers for most people these are our clients so we have the right to kind of compete for and be engaged ph for this they like our technology but making changes in payment flows take time so i think the team here is very focused on the longterm investment and building those relationship i think a particular opportunity for us is around what i call kind of financial sponsor companies et cetera where obviously given our financial sponsors franchise we have a very very good opportunity set over time but this is going to take time to execute and i think its one of those things where we have a business its performing fine but its not making a meaningful contribution but i think this is something where over time well work hard to figure out how this could make a more meaningful contribution to the firm with our client base operator thank you well go next to dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning wanted to ask about private banking and lending even ex the million gain this quarter that continues to be an area of growth can you talk about the prospects as we think about going forward and the inputs to kind of continue the level of growth youve seen denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so its highlighted as one of those areas within the overall asset wealth management business which we think has the combined benefit of growth opportunities as well as more stable and recurring revenues theres a couple components inside of that line item weve obviously seen strong growth in the deposit platform which has been contributing nicely and that was the area in which we had our marcus loans activities which on the forward those will obviously have will not be contributing on the forward but the other piece of it which is an area of strategic priority for us is the overall activities with respect to wealth lending activities the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 and we have as i think david highlighted earlier the premium ultrahigh net worth business that has been growing nicely but we feel like were relatively underpenetrated with respect to some of the lending activities with those clients and across the wealth space and so we have some new leadership across the division in the past number of quarters and a very very clear mandate that we should be out there aggressively leaning into those relationships and making sure that we can solidify them as comprehensively as possible and we expect thatll be a contributor to that line item as well on the forward daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc great and then just as a followup in terms of the balance sheet reduction outlook and as you think about line of sight which i think you used to give us some numbers and given capital markets maybe opening up and a little bit more receptive to exits anything that you could point to or numerically talk about in the shortterm that youre planning on or have as i said line of sight on denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure appreciate that question so obviously we took you to current on historical principal investments at billion you know that there is a yearend target of below billion we said we are well on pace towards that target i would say that we have line of sight on several billion of incremental reductions we have a large number of processes and positions that were exploring for disposition theyre all in various stages of completeness from exclusivity to on offer to being marketed to being prepared we moved a large number of positions yeartodate and we have more that were focused on moving from here so i would offer that up as its an ongoing highly engaged process where we expect to make incremental progress operator thank you well go next to matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning so the scb obviously came down very nicely this year and has been trending down for a couple of years now we are getting some questions on how some of the consumer loan portfolios have impacted that and specifically with the sale of the marcus loans and potentially sale of greensky loans and again according to the media potentially exit of the credit card i guess the question is do those loans actually help bring down the scb or what are the puts and takes there as you think about the impact of those loan portfolios in aggregate on the annual dfastccar denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so look youre familiar with the process as we are theres various level of transparency that you get through the process obviously there was contributions from lending activities which roll into components of the test but the big driver for us and what we feel has been enabling us to meaningfully move down our scb towards the area that weve been discussing is really attributable to the onbalance sheet investments we think that has a very very meaningful impact for us and the thing i would remind you is that the impact that was just revealed in this years test with this scb of due to be implemented in october thats based on the snapshot of activity that the fed took last year which means that all the activities that were discussing on this call are going to be considered in the next test and assuming that the test is similar next year to the test this year which i dont know but if it is we will continue to the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 see benefit from our reduction of these onbalance sheet investments so the reason why we remain so focused on setting those targets and providing so much transparency about our trajectory and our path is that we really believe that thats a very very meaningful way to understand our trajectory in terms of minimum capital ratios until obviously any new news on that front matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay so focused much more on the legacy onbalance sheet positions versus the consumer lending portfolios all right thats helpful denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah operator well take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning david good morning denis david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc david in your opening comments you were talking about you guys are still very focused on reaching a midteens roe through the cycle we all know the business has been depressed as you pointed out in your comments can you share with us if you go we have the public has access to the dealogic data your data is probably better than that but if you look at the dealogic ph data for you in and obviously the global investment banking revenues were unusually strong what would you think is a normal level for global investment banking revenues that you need to get to that midteens roe that youre targeting the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so again id highlight that global banking markets even in this environment has close to roe for the first six months of the year in whats not a great environment for investment banking we dont disclose the separate roe for investment banking but id just highlight to you its running way way below what its run on average over the course of the last and the last years we do not have to go back to kind of levels in order to see a material uplift in that investment banking roe which would bolster the overall throughthecycle uplift of our global banking markets franchise im sure in my lifetime maybe not in my career ill see another year like but falls into that category of years that come along once in a decade i wouldnt call that normal either but i would say that this is not normal and normal lies somewhere in between or average i hate the word normal average lies somewhere in between denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the only thing i would add which im sure is ph intuitive to you gerard some of the activities that are not contributing as substantially right now are very capitalefficient activities and so looking at dealogic levels of activity or revenues are one metric but some of them are very very beneficial to our overall results and they also have the capacity to catalyze other activities as a consequence so in environments of more active levels of investment banking we see some positive impact across the rest of the firm thats not necessarily captured simply from the delta explained in that investment banking line david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah one other thing gerard id just add if you go back its an interesting thing to do if you go back and you look at investment banking revenues from people who report them over the last 20plus years go back to and look at investment banking revenues theres a change in the environment and investment banking revenues have dropped meaningfully because of that you can go back and you can see that at other times over the last to years you can see that from to you can see that from to you can see that from to and obviously youre seeing it from to and whats interesting is to go look at what happens when you come out of the cycle and kind of look at the growth and the upshoot because market cap grows theres growth in the economy et cetera i dont think its going to be different this time i think this is a cycle we havent seen a cycle in a while and the other side of the cycle will continue to look attractive the services and advising the need for mergers and consolidation even though there could be headwinds and friction the need for capital markets activity ipos equity financing debt financing thats a fundamental part of our economy its not going away its been depressed for the last four to six quarters gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very helpful thank you and then denis a technical question for you on greensky you mentioned that you still have intangibles and you are going to or you still have a determination to make whether greensky should move into heldforsale twopart question what will trigger that to move it into heldforsale and then should you do that and if there is an intangible impairment do you have to take that impairment at that time when you move it into heldforsale or you can wait for a later date the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so thank you the decision as to whether and when we move it to heldforsale is when we make a decision affirmatively that we are selling the business andor selling the loan portfolio and we will when we make that decision we will designate it as such and you will see the pl consequences of that designation at that point in time we evaluate the intangibles every single quarter for impairment and in the next quarter we will also analyze the intangibles for impairment operator thank you well take our next question from jim mitchell with seaport global securities james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning just on platform solutions profitability appreciate you getting to an efficiency ratio already below but the other drag on profits is credit i think you guys noted that in consumer platforms you had a net chargeoff ratio i would imagine pointofsale is lower than card so that would imply cards is well north of in terms of the net chargeoff ratio how do we is that right and how do we think about the credit quality in that book and where you see it kind of normalizing denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so a couple things on the one hand the net chargeoff in consumer at for the quarter given the nature of our portfolio its maturity the overall operating environment we do expect that that will continue to tick up over the next couple of quarters but youll also notice that we reduced our coverage ratio this quarter as well and thats because the performance of the activities is actually coming in better than we had originally expected we had put together provisions on a conservative basis and now as we have more and more data coming through we actually are comfortable in removing some of that conservatism and bringing down the coverage ratio so id say trending as expected with overall better data coming through than originally anticipated james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay maybe just a followup question on wealth management we havent really talked about it in a while but whether its with ayco and trying to move a little bit down market from the ultrahigh net worth space can you talk to the progress youve made there and what kind of where youre seeing investments and growth denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so ayco within the overall platform ayco is something we continue to grow we continue to be focused on its extremely wellreceived in particular by a number of our csuite clients its part of our approach to having a more integrated and comprehensive approach to clients in that segment we do see opportunities to continue to expand our offering but we also see opportunities to expand within the ultrahigh net worth space both in the united states and abroad and we have a very very long track record of delivering and we believe we are actually despite the franchise underpenetrated and continue to grow that as well operator that will conclude our questionandanswer session please continue with any closing remarks the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 carey halio chief strategy officer global headinvestor relations the goldman sachs group inc yeah we just want to say thank you for
