solomon you may begin your conference david michael solomon chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you operator and good morning everyone thank you all for joining us we feel very good about our first quarter results which reflect the strength of our worldclass and interconnected franchises and the earnings power of our firm this performance was aided by the swift actions we took last year to narrow our strategic focus and play to our core strengths as you can see we are delivering on our strategy and we are pleased with the returns we generated this quarter the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 as laid out in january we have three strategic objectives to harness one goldman sachs to serve our clients with excellence to run worldclass differentiated and durable businesses and to invest to operate at scale across the firm we are effectively serving clients in what remains a complex operating environment looking back on the last year or so one of the most common questions clients and investors have asked is around the timing of a broader reopening of the capital markets ive said before that the historically depressed levels of activity wouldnt last forever ceos need to make strategic decisions for their firms companies of all sizes need to raise capital and financial sponsors need to transact to generate returns for their investors where we stand today its clear that were in the early stages of reopening of the capital markets with the first few months of seeing a reinvigoration in new issue market access for example there were a number of large ipos across geographies and the strong reception across transactions including the ipos of galderma reddit and renk is the latest sign that investors risk appetite is growing in debt capital markets tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment in investment grades with volumes hitting a record for the first three months of the year additionally refinancing was a major theme with robust highyield and institutional loan refinancing volumes given a more accommodative issuance backdrop as well as the potential for increased acquisition financing alongside higher ma activities we expect solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year with our longstanding leadership positions across the global capital markets we have been at the forefront in helping our clients access the markets and our firm stands to benefit further as transaction volumes rise from the 10year lows its important to note that alongside the reopening we are seeing in capital markets our intermediation businesses continue to be active in supporting our clients needs and were growing financing revenues across ficc and equities which together were a record this quarter and rose sequentially all in our toptier intermediation franchise and more durable financing results are helping raise the floor in global banking markets in asset wealth management assets under supervision rose to a new record of trillion this quarter which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of longterm feebased net inflows we have a diversified platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes and we continue to invest resources in growing this business particularly across wealth management alternatives and solutions in wealth management we saw significant strength this quarter with total client assets ending at trillion in alternatives we raised billion in commitments despite a more difficult fundraising environment and in solutions we saw continued demand for outsourced cio and sma offerings these are all areas in which we still see significant opportunities and where we have a proven track record and demonstrated right to win i also want to touch on a topic coming up in virtually every client conversation i have artificial intelligence while there is broad consensus about the transforming potential of ai there is enormous appetite for perspectives on how certain aspects may play out including the timeline for commercial impact shape of potential regulation impacts on jobs and where value will prove in the ecosystem today we are proud to be at the forefront of advising clients on these topics and how to think about potential use cases in their operations as we look longer term to the extent that this technology develops in line with expectation there will be significant demand for ai related infrastructure and as a result financing which will be a tailwind to our business for our own operations we have a leading team of engineers dedicated to exploring and applying machine learning and artificial intelligence applications we are focused on enhancing productivity particularly for our the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 developers and increasing operating efficiency while maintaining a high bar for quality security and controls like with any emerging technology a thoughtful approach and keen eye on risk management will be crucial turning to the macro environment we continue to be constructive on the health of the us economy the fed most recently telegraphed three rate cuts in but last weeks cpi print has lowered market expectations this will continue to evolve and be highly datadependent im also mindful that us equity markets are hovering near record levels at a time when we continue to see headwinds including concerns around inflation the commercial real estate market and escalating geopolitical tensions around the world this combination could slow growth but that said the us economy has proven to be resilient supported by a number of factors including government spending as well as labor force growth driven by abovetrend levels of immigration so while the environment is constructive and markets expect a soft landing the trajectory is still uncertain nonetheless im very confident about the state of our client franchise the caliber of our people and our culture of collaboration and excellence every day as i interact with the people of goldman sachs around the world i am consistently impressed by their talent capabilities and how tirelessly they work to serve our clients the quality of our people reinforces my conviction in the longterm opportunity set for goldman sachs and our ability to deliver for clients and shareholders i will now turn it over to denis to cover our financial results for the quarter denis p coleman chief financial officer the goldman sachs

underwriting revenues of million both rose significantly yearoveryear amid an increase in industry volumes our backlog fell quarteronquarter as we successfully brought transactions to market though client engagement and dialogues remain robust ficc net revenues were billion in the quarter up from a strong performance last year as our global scaled franchise continued to serve clients amid a dynamic operating environment intermediation results were driven by better performance in mortgages credit and currencies our long history of risktaking acumen enabled us to effectively make markets across a number of different geographies and asset classes we produced record ficc financing revenues of million which rose sequentially primarily on better results in repo we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow balances and drive growth in this business over time equities net revenues were billion in the quarter equities intermediation revenues of billion rose yearoveryear on better performance in derivatives equities financing revenues of billion were modestly higher yearoveryear as record average prime balances during the quarter were only partially offset by lower financing spreads the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 moving to asset wealth management on page revenues of billion were higher yearoveryear record management and other fees were up yearoveryear to billion as a reminder we closed the sale of personal financial management in november of last year which contributed approximately million in fees in the yearago period incentive fees for the quarter were million up sequentially and yearoveryear based on our bottomsup analysis we expect to reach our target of billion in annual incentive fees over the medium term supported by an estimated billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of yearend private banking and lending revenues were million up substantially as revenues in the prioryear period were negatively impacted by the partial sale of our marcus loan portfolio equity investments and debt investments revenues totaled million in equity investments we saw improved performance yearoveryear in our private portfolio that was largely offset by a markdown on a large public position now moving to page total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record trillion we had billion of longterm net inflows largely in fixed income representing our 25th consecutive quarter of longterm fee based inflows turning to page on alternatives alternative assets under supervision totaled billion at the end of the first quarter driving million in management and other fees gross thirdparty fundraising was billion in the quarter we continue to expect to raise between billion and billion in alternatives across private equity and other strategies this year more broadly we are leveraging our longstanding leadership position in private credit to capitalize on the secular growth opportunity and expect to grow our assets from roughly billion to billion over the next five years onbalance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately billion in the first quarter we reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by billion to billion we expect reductions at roughly this pace for the rest of and expect to sell down the vast majority of our hpi portfolio by the end of consistent with our target next platform solutions on page revenues were million overall segment profitability has improved with a pretax net loss of million for the quarter in line with our target we expect the drive this business to pre tax breakeven next year on page firmwide net interest income was billion in the first quarter up sequentially on an increase in interest earning assets our total loan portfolio at quarter end was billion roughly in line with the fourth quarter as an increase in other collateralized lending was partially offset by the sale of the remaining greensky portfolio our provision for credit losses was million which reflected net chargeoffs in our credit card lending portfolio within our wholesale portfolio impairments trended modestly lower versus the levels in the last few quarters turning to page we continue to provide additional information detailing our cre exposure as you know we moved early in actively risk managing our cre exposure and

the standardized approach in the quarter we returned billion to shareholders including common stock repurchases of billion and common stock dividends of million we are currently running with basis point buffer above our capital requirements given expectations for significant modifications to the basel iii proposed rule we should have materially more flexibility on capital deployment we also remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable and growing dividend in conclusion our first quarter results reflect the strength of our leading global banking markets franchise and our growing asset wealth management business simply put we are delivering on the things we said we would do we are focused on our strategic objectives and the execution focus areas in that we laid out in january which will help our businesses produce midteens returns through the cycle we are confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for goldman sachs with that well now open up the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now take a moment to compile the qa roster operator instructions well go first to glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much indiscernible you are definitely executing on a lot of the objectives you laid out and of course the sustainability of banking is what it is i noticed your lower pipeline but the real question i have is the sustainability of the whole package meaning you just had really strong revenue across the board on everything comp was up with that normally but noncomp was down the provision was down and rwa didnt increase even though you were growing your financing so im giving you a softball here and just saying what of that package can continue to stick david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i appreciate it glenn and i think there are bunch of things that continue to stick because one of the things you know what weve been focused on is building a more durable business and that there are a handful of things when you look across the whole package where weve made significant progress over the course of the last five years certainly building our financing business and our markets business is something thats more durable and more sustainable we still think theres lots of room to grow and look the worlds growing i mean the world grows and our clients grow they need us to finance them weve got the capital to deploy as long as we can drive attractive returns with that client base and so we stay focused on that weve doubled our management fees on our asset wealth management business over the last five years and we continue to be very focused on fundraising our ability to deliver on that those are more durable revenues and theres operating leverage around that business that we still think we have yet to achieve youve seen the margin improvement obviously in that business but that business still has a higher capital density than wed like the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 that business to have and we continue to focus on our historical principal investments and making progress there overall i think weve meaningfully improved the client franchise and taken wallet share and were just very very focused on our relative participation in the market opportunity that exists with our big institutional clients and weve said over the course of the last few years and there have been lots of questions on it are those wallet shares sticky i think the wallet shares are what i cant tell you for sure is what the opportunity set is on every quarter to quarter but when you look at the breadth the leadership position the global nature of these businesses and you look at the whole package these are durable businesses that produce accretive returns where were very well positioned and we continue to focus on executing and enhancing that position glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i definitely appreciate all that and could we talk just follow up on just the noncomp piece and talk you had some big drops in amortization and depreciation and some marketing and stuff so are those at actually run rate levels now going forward also because that was a nice positive surprise denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning glenn its denis as weve said over the last number of quarters weve been very very focused on noncomp and containing the growth of noncomp there clearly are inflationary pressures that impact a number of items in our noncomp expense the sharp decrease sequentially were pleased with as well as the yearoveryear decrease but there were a number of items over the course of last year that we didnt necessarily expect to repeat and so its good to get on to a more normalized operating trajectory with respect to our non comp expense base but its something were going to remain very very focused on managing in a disciplined fashion but i think this quarter is a much more normal quarter than some of the preceding quarters operator thank you well go next to ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess i just wanted to follow up david you mentioned ai and would love that thats still its hard in our seats to figure out whats hype whats real if you can doubleclick on some of the comments you made around comparing whats going on with ai today versus maybe the dotcom bubble around the runway this might create for capital marketsib not just for this year but beyond and then also the other side around is there line of sight of how much more efficient goldman itself can get by deploying ai thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so i mean big picture and look im not a stock picker so im not going to comment when you make a comparison to the internet explosion in im not going to comment around that i think weve got a lot of stock market capitalization thats being driven by big platforms that i think have an enormous competitive advantage around the scaling of these technologies but broadly speaking these technologies require certain things including infrastructure power and these things require financing to drive the scale thats going to be necessary for people to execute on the investments that they see as important to keep their businesses competitive at pace and that is creating an ecosystem of activity in our investment banking and markets business that weve seen in the context of other areas of significant shift or macro expansion over a long period of time the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 so i actually think theres a very very constructive runway of opportunity set for us with our clients as people reposition their businesses and were talking about a level of scale that is candidly unprecedented and so i think that opportunity is something over the course this is not a quartertoquarter thing this is over the next to years and were very very focused on it and very engaged and by the way its not just companies its governments obviously that are making enormous investments in bringing infrastructure into their locales and so all of this is something that were very strategically focused on doubleclicking and getting more narrowly focused on goldman sachs i would just say we see enormous opportunities for productivity gains and also opportunities for efficiency our use cases that were testing and that were implementing focus on those two areas but id really like the focus to be more on productivity and the ability to scale our smartest people to do more with our clients rather than expecting an efficiency gain that becomes very cost accretive i think one of the most important things for this firm and the success of this firm is the time our people spend with clients serving our clients executing for our clients and these tools give us more productivity and also when we look at our data sets and what we have internally an ability to deliver them a valueadded package of information thought process that we think can be differentiated and so were very focused on the productivity side although of course we have analog systems and processes where there will be efficiency and were also focused on bringing those to bear when we look at our overall cost structure ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats good color thank you and just separately for the goldman stock right i think from an investor standpoint a lot of focus on how quickly we can grow the share of asset management youve talked about the hpis coming down alt assets going up how else should shareholders and prospective investors think about strategy around growing the asset management revenues and is inorganic growth at all part of the strategy and in terms of how management is thinking about things today thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so in january we said to you we thought highsingledigit growth with margin improvement and less capital density over time were executing on that we are very focused at the moment on our organic execution firm obviously generates a lot of capital there could be a time in the future where something might come up that could be interesting and could accelerate that pace in the overall mix but at the moment our focus is on the execution of what we have in front of us and we are making good progress but i think weve put out a handful of metrics both in terms of top line growth our ability to continue to fundraise you saw that we highlighted billion of fundraising in alternatives in the first quarter we said we expect to raise billion to billion this year obviously the billion keeps us on pace for the billion to billion we said we could raise this year that doesnt stop this year we think we have a very strong fundraising machine that can continue for a number of years going forward so were focused on the things that matter in asset management what matters performance matters client experience matters were incredibly focused on both those things and working hard to make sure we use our global scale and the depth that we have around the world to execute very effectively the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 operator thank you well go next to christian bolu with autonomous research christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning guys maybe ill ask glenns question in a different way if i look at that roe for the global banking markets business it really catches my eye here so how would you characterize this quarters performance is it like sort of normalish to you does it feel maybe peakish to you again just trying to figure out if roe is anywhere ph near sustainable for that business david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc theres no way to ph say this it was a strong quarter for global banking markets peak i mean i can point in the last few years to quarters in global banking markets where the returns were higher but i certainly wouldnt say that this is what we expect to be an average quarter in global banking markets weve said clearly we think this is a midteens business through the cycle the performance this quarter was higher there were performance last year was meaningfully lower i think the right thing to focus on christian is mid teens through the cycle thats the way we think about it and there was client activity and opportunity set for us this quarter and i think one of the things that we continue to try to talk about is that when there is opportunity with our clients there is opportunity in the market were good at capturing that delivering that to shareholders and then when the environment is more tough though this is a more durable and sustainable business than people may have looked at it in the past but i would view this as a very strong quarter in global banking markets and not what we would target as the average run rates of the business christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thats very helpful maybe onto private wealth if im reading slide correctly you had something like billion of inflows into wealth management aus so that would equate to something like organic growth which is well above peers i would call it bestinclass so can you give more color on whats driving that growth maybe any color by regions or products as to whats resonating with clients and again longerterm how youre thinking about sustainability of that level of organic growth david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah again this i think comes down to focus and you know we made some very we talk about conscious decisions we had talked about broadening our wealth platform to get much more broadly into what id call kind of high net worth wealth management and with the sale of united capital we continue to be very focused on our ultrahigh net worth platform it is an extraordinary platform i do think its a bestinclass platform i do think that the ultrahigh net worth business is still a very fragmented business while we have leading share i think those shares are still on a global basis a leader as a singledigit share theres a lot of wealth in the world theres a lot of wealth accumulating we are very very well positioned to continue to capture that secular trend and i think the business is performing very very well our alts franchise i think is differentiated and were allowed to deliver alts in an effective way to wealth clients i think thats something that gives us a strong secular tailwind were expanding our private banking activity thats not something that we have been focused on which i think is also strengthening our position as a wealth manager so i think theres a good runway for this business i do think its a bestinclass franchise that has room the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 to grow and i think youre seeing it perform well and were very focused on it and i think the sharp decision around how were going to focus this business i think were benefiting from at the moment christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp great thank you operator well go next to betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning can you hear me okay david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right great just wanted to make sure david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc we can hear you fine thank you betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thanks so just two followups one i heard all the commentary about how the s run rate a little bit better than run rate on average over time but it doesnt take away from the fact that was very strong and i just wanted to understand was there anything that we should understand about the revenues in equities and fixed income for example that were different this quarter and the reason i ask is var efficiency was so strong right youve delivered very strong trading revenues on var that was basically flat q on q i mean a little down a little up depending on which asset class youre looking at so was there anything in when you mentioned you stepped in to client activity and opportunity set was there anything unique about that opportunity set that enabled you to do this in a way that didnt really tag var at all denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so betsy its denis nice to hear from you the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc look to give you some color on that i wouldnt point to any particular discrete item i would say the revenue generation and the activity was broadbased but in addition to the consequence of the focus on market share and wallet share that weve made across the client franchise over time we also did see good opportunities to risk intermediate on behalf of clients across geographies across asset classes and i would observe that over the course of the quarter it was just a very benign operating environment credit spreads were tightening equity valuations were going up and that provides a tailwind to our performance across portions of our global banking markets business as well the first quarter is obviously often seasonally strong as well so we think we really captured a lot of the opportunity that was presented by both the environment and our client engagement and as david said that may not necessarily be the case each and every quarter particularly in ficc and equities so when we talk about like a global banking markets segment overall clearly more upside across banking but a strong performance across both ficc and equities in  betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc super thats really helpful thanks for the incremental color there just one other followup david you mentioned youre able to deliver alts in a unique way to the wealth platform that youve got could you just give us a little more color as to what were thinking about there that we should understand thanks so much david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i think one of the things that our wealth management franchise finds very attractive is we run an open platform and so when it comes to alts we obviously have a very very broad very very deep very very unique offering as one of the top five or six alt providers on an integrated basis in the world with our own products what were manufacturing out of our asset management business but in addition we want an open platform where we deliver them access to alternative solutions and products from all different worldclass managers around the world across the spectrum and so i think thats a very very unique offering that very very affluent people who wealth manage at goldman sachs find super attractive and super differentiated operator thank you well go next to brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question so wanted to ask one on your ma franchise so the recovery in announced ma has been really impressive but really kind of dominated by strategics and given your strong franchise among sponsors curious to get an update about what youre seeing among that cohort and maybe when you might expect we will see a ramp in announcements from the sponsor side the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah brennan appreciate that question and thats a sharp observation on your part the sponsor activity is still muted but i would say its definitely picking up the engagement with sponsors in the quarter was meaningfully improved and as ive said before sponsors make money both for themselves and for their investors by buying things and selling things and the level of activity has been incredibly muted and when you look at the lp community the lp community is putting a lot of pressure on the financial sponsor community to return more capital and increase the velocity of capital return and so i do think the pace is going to pick up in the coming quarters id say the activity and interaction and engagement is higher in the first quarter than it was throughout but i would say its still operating at lower levels theres a lot of upside for our business our business is very correlated to a pickup in sponsor activity and so to the degree that it did pick up that would be a very big tailwind for our business across banking and markets broadly when i look at our leveraged finance deals book its still operating at historically very very low levels we feel fortunate that weve got a good amount of capital flexibility that was to accelerate to deploy which is obviously very accretive and attractive business were not seeing it really accelerate yet but i think its coming and certainly the sustained level weve had over the level weve had over the course of the last to months is not sustainable it will pick up its just a question of when and so that is a potential tailwind to our business in future quarters brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that color david i appreciate it and then another question on alts so fundraising looks really good i know there can be some noise in the revenue so just curious about the alts revenue down yearover year and the aus only up sort of marginally sequentially could you give us some color around what was happening in those lines and maybe any potential noise denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure brennan its denis so couple of things obviously the movement in aus is a function of how we fundraise how we deploy and overall levels we have had a lot of success fundraising not just in the last quarter at billion but now with the full 265plus billion since the original investor day but there is a lag in terms of when some of that capital is put to a use and actually moves into aus not all of our funds that are raised are aus immediately so i think that is something you can look out for in future periods and then in terms of some of the sequentials on alts as david was walking through our platform our wealth platform in terms of having goldman sachs proprietary funds also open architecture or thirdparty platform some of the alts fees we generate in raising capital for other managers on our platform as we look over the sequential period we had less by way of placement fees associated with those capital raises in the quarter than we did in the fourth quarter last year operator thank you well go next to mike mayo with wells fargo the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi david you reiterated the desire for goldman to have a more narrow strategic focus but you still have some cleanup from the past charges this quarter for greensky the gm card platform solutions still lost million so im just trying to figure out in this context where transaction banking stands i mean you had yearover year growth so thats decent but three years ago march you guys said transaction banking youre building global payments around the world and then march of this year on bloomberg it says that youre closing japan and now youre focusing on the us and europe so on the one hand are you simply pulling back your ambitions on the other hand maybe you have more financial discipline and youre making sure these adjacent activities are generating profits instead of just growth david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc look mike i think you summarized it well i think its yes to a bunch of the things that you said were looking hard we are i think its very important for me to say that were very committed to transaction banking we think weve got very very good technology and a good platform that we can grow and continue to scale over time but theres no question were very focused on making sure that we execute appropriately and that its not just top line growth that it delivers profitability its something that fits in our client franchise and adds to the portfolio of things that we can bring to our clients i think some of the ambitions might have been too broad in terms of our ability to execute immediately and so weve narrowed that but we remain committed focused and growing and i think this is a medium and longer term project that we will deliver on its small but i think weve got the right focus we made a hire to bolster the expertise and the leadership and were moving forward on that strategy and with respect to the cleanup we continue to narrow and clean up the aftertax loss from the platforms it was less than million weve said clearly that we believe that we can bring the platforms to breakeven or profitability in and were executing against that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc just to follow up on the transaction banking you said some ambitions were too broad again its better to have profitable growth than just growth so point acknowledged but what happened i mean where were you kind of underestimating expenses or the buildout costs or what was more difficult than you had anticipated david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think there were a number of things mike that came together i think when youre building new businesses you give authority to the people that are building those businesses and you create metrics and you hold people accountable as you advance and i think there were things where we thought we could do more globally and candidly when we really looked at the cost of executing and delivering there was more friction in that context and so weve chosen to narrow some of that in terms of the global footprint of that that doesnt mean later there might not be opportunity to do it but we think for now thats the right action id say secondarily the regulatory environment changed massively and has also raised the bar and created headwinds and a different lens with which we look at the expansion of these kinds of activities and so thats something else that went into the mix and so look i think one of the things that we try to do is to look at the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 everything with facts with data with information to be unemotional and to be willing to say okay this isnt exactly right so were going to adjust and i think were showing that were willing to adjust and make adjustments always with a goal of growing the firm and delivering for shareholders driving profitable businesses that deliver accretive returns to shareholders when we get some things right when we get some things wrong but when we look at the information the data and its not exactly perfect well adjust operator thank you well go next to steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so wanted to follow up david on denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc good morning guys wanted to follow up david with the earlier discussion just on sponsorrelated activity private credit fundraising remains robust but the syndicated markets are also reopening just wanted to better understand what youre seeing in terms of competition in syndicated versus private markets how its impacting your ib and alt franchises and just given some of the recent press coverage maybe just speak to your growth ambitions in the private credit space more broadly david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure ill make a couple of comments but im going to ask denis to comment too because as you know denis ran these businesses for us for an extended period of time but id just say first the narrative that in some way shape or form this is about the syndicated market versus the private market i think is an oversimplification as transaction volumes increase particularly in the sponsor community the amount of activity thatll come out of the syndicated market will obviously increase meaningfully were very well positioned for that we are one of the largest players in that and that area is operating at its cyclical lows at the moment but thats going to continue to be a very very important part of capital formation and its not going away the growth in private credit will continue i think were very well positioned for that we have about billion of private credit assets which makes us one of the largest players ive said publicly we have aspirations to continue to invest and grow and we see a number of places where we can do that were very focused on that i do think its important to highlight that weve not been through a credit cycle in a very long time and so while there are lots of private credit players that continue to grow and expand how those platforms and those businesses will respond when we do go through a credit cycle and we will go through a credit cycle is a little bit unclear at the moment the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 but i think strategically were in a very very interesting position because we have the ability to marry for our clients both our capabilities in the syndicated market and also our private credit capabilities and you can see that i mean i can point to a transaction that weve done in the last few months where we did just that and in fact it wasnt just in credit it was in equity too you can look at the endeavor transaction and you can look at our ability to participate and lead both as a syndicated lender but also as a capital provider across the capital structure for our investors as an example of a way that i think our franchise and our platform is differentiated denis do you want to add anything to those comments denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i think its well covered i mean i think theres been a lot of discussion over the past year of sort of private credit versus syndicated alternative but the reality is the syndicated alternative didnt really exist and so it was really just a discussion around private credit with first quarter activity levels you now see a viable functioning and healthy syndicated loan market the vast majority of the activity was actually refinancing a lot of that refinancing was refinancing private credit capital structures with the more attractive pricing available in the broad based syndicated market so the reality is these are all just forms of credit made available to different borrowers and over time i think there will be a much more normalized mix where youll see underwritten as well as directly lent solutions in some cases existing in the same capital structure and i think were just in a healthier environment but from goldman sachss perspective is positive because the data points that we now see across the leveraged lending market make sponsorestimated weighted average cost of capital much more observable and that should unlock their ability to start to price and put together transactions that should fuel some incremental sponsorrelated change in control activity so i think the sort of two markets functioning side by side is good in terms of activity and what it means on the forward for goldman sachs steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc really helpful color and for my followup just on capital management cet1 continues to build youre well in excess of the regulatory minimums the direction of travel in basel iii in terms of expectations around the proposal is certainly more favorable at the same time it now looks like you might be more constrained by the slr which declined to i know thats never intended to be the binding constraint but was hoping you could speak to how youre managing through leverage constraint which at least appears to be binding at the moment and what we should expect in terms of the pace of buyback and whether that actually informs your expectation there denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks thanks steven so youre right on all counts obviously we have a variety of both capital and liquidity ratios that we manage to over time the slr is a slow moving ratio as you know but our bindingness can move back and forth between various ratios over time and we have a bunch of levers that we can pull with respect to our activities to manage that but i appreciate the question operator thank you well go next to devin ryan with citizens jmp devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities great thanks so much first question just on kind of maybe a bigger picture on the wallet share in markets i know this has been really ongoing work for the firm and obviously not just the quarter but really the past few the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 years this has been a pretty consistent story so if we kind of move aside financing love to maybe just drill down on some of the individual products that are accelerating in equities and ficc and where youre most pleased with the execution that has occurred over the last several years and then youre still where you see the biggest room to close any gaps that are maybe still there thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc at a high level and this was one of the things that we observed and i think we got right over a period of time you know that we started with the top were now focused on the top clients in these business the top clients provide a very significant portion of all the activity in this franchise and so your share with them and managing the share with them has a big impact on your wallet shares i think the thing that weve done well and that we see is really the case is that they all operate across all products and all activities and all silos and the ability to create a very seamless experience for them across the firm is a big change for us versus where we might have been a decade ago and so its something were very focused on there are times where there is more activity in commodities theres times when theres more activity in credit theres times when theres more activity in mortgages it moves and it ebbs and flows but what were really trying to do is make sure we have the full package to serve them in the most effective way and weve made real progress in that over the course of the last couple of years i think the opportunity for us to continue to make progress comes from the fact that in the top i think we stand at slightly under top with of them dont hold me to that number because that is probably okay of them so obviously we have progress to make because theres no reason why goldman sachs shouldnt be top with the overwhelming majority much closer to of those and also when you look at top there are also clients where were third where we absolutely should be first or second so we continue to drill down we continue to go talk to our clients listen to our clients get feedback on how we can do a better job serving them and that discipline and that rigor i think is helping us execute for them but theres more work to do and we dont take our position for granted we try to create the right culture of focus and intensity that allows us to continue to deliver and execute for them devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities yeah okay great thanks david maybe a quick followup here for denis just on the equity investments line not a great quarter there not a drag either feels like its been some time since weve seen maybe a more normal quarter without big puts and takes and so just given the reconstitution of that book how would you frame what a more normal quarter should look like from a revenue perspective and then how the private portfolio is positioned if we are moving into a better exit environment obviously its been tough there as well thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks for the question so a couple of things and it may have been embedded in your question but obviously looking at some of the progress in the equity investments line on a sequential basis just a reminder that in  when we sold personal financial management that was reflected as a gain in equity investments about million that did not repeat so that will give you some insight into how thats trending sequentially on a yearoveryear basis we are seeing performance in the private portfolio sort of in line with what youre suggesting we might expect but we did see a particular markdown in public portfolio that sort of netted into the ultimate equity investment results we also as you know have focused on selling down portion of our historical principal the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 investments so a combination of the ultimate size of the notional remaining in our portfolio combined with what the market conditions are will obviously contribute to the ultimate performance the other guidance that we have put out there generally mediumterm guidance is that across both equity and debt investments youre looking at a number of about billion on a year so you put that in a quarter about million those are some pieces of color id give you operator well go next to matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning actually just a followup on the last question and comment the runoff of the historical principal investment from the billion here the billion that you just referenced is that the runoff that you expect or was that alluding to the revenues per year denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks let me clarify i was making a comment with respect to revenue and then separately as it relates to the rundown of that portfolio i guess the way to think of it picking up questions from last earnings andor this one the progress that we made in the first quarter of roughly billion we think thats decent assumption for the pace over the course of this year and then we just reiterated our commitment to selling down substantially all of it in line with our target matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay so billion per quarter is what youre implying from here for the rest of the year denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc on the historical principal investment portfolio yeah we would expect something roughly in line with billion per quarter for the balance of the year operator well go next to saul martinez with hsbc saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hi thanks for taking my question i wanted to ask about your financing business in markets and obviously theres uncertainty about the basel endgame proposal as you mentioned the direction of travel seems to be for it to be materially lightened or even reproposed but one of the areas where it is very punitive versus other jurisdictions is in securities financing the risk weightings for unlisted entities and if that part of the proposal isnt materially altered and it doesnt seem like it necessarily is a focus does that impact your ability to grow your financing revenues is it a threat is it not a big deal can you offset it through pricing and product design just curious if you can provide a little color on that david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2024 sure so obviously where basel iii ends up and which components of the rule actually are put in place and how theyre drafted and how theyre calculated et cetera will be highly determinative but i would say the breadth of our financing activities across both ficc and equity are much broader than that particular component and we expect that the underlying demand from our clients for financing across both ficc and equities will remain high we have leading market shares and capabilities there so well expect to be able to deliver in that regard and depending on where various pieces of regulation end up well make whatever adjustments we need either to pricing or the mix of our businesses or look for other ways to serve our clients saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay thanks thats helpful and then maybe just following up on indiscernible and the implications of it being soft and denis you mentioned more flexibility on capital deployment given the direction of travel in basel i mean how should we be thinking about buyback activity from here you did billion do you feel like there is scope to increase that and potentially bring your payout ratio even closer to of earnings denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i appreciate the question that we were deliberate in our script remarks about the degree of capital flexibility that we expected but also pick up on something that david said earlier on the call which is that we remain very committed to our capital deployment hierarchy which starts with our client franchise and some of the activities where historically weve been able to deploy capital have been less active and so we have a good amount of cushion and flexibility at this point in time and as our clients become more active the first place that were going to look to deploy our capital is to support our clients and their activities and after that we would of course as you note continue to be focused on a sustainable and growing dividend and only after that would we think about return of capital operator thank you at this time there are no further questions ladies and
