denis coleman let me pass the call to david david michael solomon chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you carey and good morning everybody thank you for joining us today let me start by saying a few words on the operating environment global economy continues to face significant headwinds inflation remains high central banks are raising interest rates at a pace not seen in decades meanwhile equity markets are well off the recent highs geopolitical instability and energy shocks are an ongoing concern and gdp growth expectations are declining many of these trends accelerated toward the end of the quarter for example while our own financial conditions index has indicated steady tightening all year we saw a sharp increase in the index starting in midaugust everywhere i go macro themes dominate my conversations with ceos they tell me that they are rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more certainty before committing to longerterm plans as we head into the fourth quarter my sense is that the outlook will remain unsettled though economic performance will vary by region and also expect volatility to persist as markets continue to digest these factors against this backdrop im pleased that goldman sachs delivered solid results in the third quarter as i said before the breadth and strength of our global franchise is a key differentiator for us and client engagement remains strong for the quarter we generated net revenues of billion earnings per share of return on equity of and a return on tangible equity of before handing it over to denis to review the quarterly results in detail i would like to spend a moment on our strategic evolution turning to page of the presentation four years ago we set out to enhance our client the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 engagement efforts with the goal of further strengthening our worldclass client franchise our one goldman sachs philosophy was born out of that endeavor starting with a 30client pilot evolving to what has now become the operating ethos of the firm one goldman sachs has been successful well beyond our expectations proving that the strength and breadth of our global client relationships are key drivers of the execution of our strategy and continued outperformance these efforts have produced leading share gains particularly in our core businesses and have resulted in a book value per share growth since our investor day in the execution of one goldman sachs over the last four years has amplified two foundational elements of our firm first the relationship and advisory mindset that underlies our investment banking franchise translates exceptionally well across client engagement more broadly second the increasingly symbiotic nature of our businesses creates a virtuous ecosystem that results in a significant multiplier effect and drives market share because of this we are making a series of organizational changes in the fourth quarter to take the next step in the evolution of our strategy changes will further strengthen our core businesses accelerate our ability to scale the growth platforms and improve efficiency as you can see on page we are integrating our asset wealth management businesses as well as our investment banking and global markets businesses into two important segments of the firm we will also create a new segment called platform solutions that will consolidate our fintech platforms from across the firm including transaction banking consumer partnerships and greensky this segment will enhance our focus on building platforms that deliver digital financial services capabilities to corporate and institutional clients we will further integrate our directtoconsumer activities into wealth management given the growing convergence of wealth and consumer banking we will report our full year earnings using these three segments and will also host an investor day on february we look forward to reviewing the details of our forward strategy across the businesses although we will tell you now that our fundamental strategy remains the same and we will be maintaining our principal financial targets we are excited about the role that asset wealth management will play in our forward growth plans across asset wealth management we are operating a fully scaled and integrated franchise providing advice solutions and execution for institutions and individuals across both public and private markets running these businesses together will allow us to holistically drive towards our billion and billion management fee targets our investment selection and performance for our clients has supported strong momentum particularly in alternatives and wealth management we also believe that reaching and serving employees in their workplace is a significant growth opportunity for goldman sachs through our strength and capabilities in workplace and personal wealth we can now address all the employees at the companies we serve this expanded offering is a direct response to a clear push from csuite leaders for a more democratized suite of advice and solutions its also clear that these clients prefer an integrated wealth management and banking offering which presents us with a tremendous opportunity to connect with millions of clients through their workplace over the past few years global markets and investment banking have been increasingly operating as a unified leading worldclass franchise we are the advisor of choice supported by our number one lead table positions across ma and ecm and we continue to bolster our leading position as a marketmaker and risk intermediary for our clients in markets across the globe as the world has gotten more complex and our clients demands have evolved we are seeing that more and more of them are partnering with both global markets and investment banking to meet their needs synergies across these businesses from advice financing risk distribution and hedging allows us to deliver differentiated solutions to our clients this creates a significant multiplier effect and the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 has helped us drive market share gains across the franchise in recent years running these businesses together will enable us to maximize our wallet share turning to page platform solutions is an endtoend primarily cloudbased technology platform business that embeds our bestinclass financial products and services into our clients ecosystems to serve them and their clients and customers in recent years we saw an opportunity to leverage our preeminent corporate franchise worldclass risk management and innovative culture to build modern digital products and in the process diversify our revenues and funding mix we have built and launched a transaction banking platform a digital consumer banking platform the largest piece of which is credit card and we acquired greensky these platforms have led to partnerships with a number of our clients such as apple general motors stripe american express and fiserv through our relationships with apple and general motors we already have the ability to access more than million individuals in the us combination of our brand and apple is unique as proven by the reaction to apple card which has been ranked number one in customer satisfaction for two consecutive years by jd power we have also extended our partnership to new products just last week we introduced a new goldman sachs savings account for apple card that allows users to grow their rewards in a highyield savings account and to add funds through a linked banking account or directly from apple cash this embeds a highyield savings account from goldman sachs directly into the apple card experience in apple wallet goldman sachs and apple are committed to expanding our relationship and we have recently extended and adjusted our partnership through the end of the decade in order to continue to help consumers live healthier financial lives in transaction banking we are delivering a differentiated developercentric

active clients with greater than billion in deposits globally as we leverage our corporate franchise to become the partner of choice in the payments arena our priority in platform solutions for the next few years is to continue to diversify goldman sachs revenue and funding while driving profitability we will look forward to talking to you more about this segment at our investor day in february let me now address some additional details on our consumer business since weve made a significant investment and on page you can see what weve achieved as a result we serve over million customers and generated more than billion in revenues in the last months weve learned a lot in the six years since launching the deposit business and this is shaping our execution priorities as we move forward turning to page for our directtoconsumer strategy we will focus on existing deposit customers and consumers that we already have access to through channels like workplace and personal wealth rather than seeking to acquire customers on a mass scale a purposeful change that will allow us to rationalize spend on future builds and customer acquisition costs in workplace and personal wealth alone we already have the ability to reach over million individuals our marcus deposit customers remain core to our broader efforts we will continue to grow the deposit offering and the level of service that has generated over billion of retail deposits we believe that all of our customers across all products will benefit from this reprioritization before i turn it over to denis to go through the results for the quarter i want to highlight the following over the last four years this leadership team has been working hard to grow diversify and strengthen goldman sachs our experience forms this new direction so that we can better serve our clients and amplify our strengths this is the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 an important and purposeful evolution of our strategic journey setting us up to deliver on our targets and unlock shareholder value consistent with our strategy were focusing our execution on three key priorities as you can see on page which are to grow management fees maximize wallet share and grow financing activities and scale platform solutions to deliver pretax profitability well talk more about this at our investor day in february i will now turn it over to denis denis p coleman chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david and good morning lets start with our results on page of the presentation as david mentioned we generated earnings per share for the third quarter of on a yeartodate basis we delivered a return on common equity of and a return on tangible equity of turning to performance by segment starting on page investment banking generated revenues of billion down versus a very strong quarter a year ago financial advisory revenues were million down versus record performance in the third quarter last year despite lower volumes we maintained our number one lead table position yeartodate and expanded our lead equity underwriting net revenues were million reflecting limited industrywide activity nonetheless we continue to rank number one yeartodate in equity and equityrelated offerings debt underwriting net revenues were million given muted issuance volumes across both highyield and investment grade while activity remained slow this quarter our backlog is robust particularly in advisory and equity underwriting our advisory dialogues continue to be strong though clients are focused on stability in financial conditions pushing out the timing of certain deal and financingrelated activity corporate lending generated net revenues of million a solid performance in middlemarket lending and transaction banking was largely offset by headwinds on certain hedges in our portfolio and marks in leverage lending moving to global markets on page segment net revenues were billion in the quarter up yearon year as client engagement and activity remained strong financing activities continued to demonstrate stable growth comprising approximately of the total revenues in this segment starting now with ficc on page revenues were billion in the third quarter higher than the third quarter of ficc intermediation produced net revenues of billion up yearoveryear we saw strength across our rates currencies and commodities franchises amid elevated levels of client engagement catalyzed by increased central bank activity and volatility in ficc financing we generated a increase in revenues driven by increased opportunities across repo and mortgage lending we remain focused on growing this business in support of our clients financing needs our ficc lending portfolio is conservatively underwritten and well collateralized moving to equities net revenues in the third quarter were billion equities intermediation revenues fell yearoveryear due to a more challenging marketmaking environment and lower client activity in equities financing we generated nearrecord revenues of billion as we supported client financing activities despite lower prime balances the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 moving to asset management on page asset management net revenues were billion management and other fees totaled billion roughly flat relative to last quarter and up yearoveryear reflecting management fees from nnip and the rolloff of fee waivers on money market funds equity investments generated revenues of million in the third quarter more specifically our public equity portfolio produced approximately million of revenues primarily driven by gains on two investments across our private portfolio we generated approximately million of net revenues we saw eventdriven gains of over million for various positions in our portfolio and operating revenues of roughly million from our consolidated investment entities these revenues were partially offset by approximately million of marks driven by several investments in the consumer and tmt sectors given current market conditions our harvesting of onbalance sheet investments was limited in the third quarter but we remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and migrate our alternatives business to more thirdparty funds we continued to make progress on our fundraising targets securing billion of alternative commitments this quarter we also closed west street capital partners viii our flagship private equity fund which at billion was significantly above its original target net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were million primarily reflecting net interest income of million ill now turn to consumer wealth management on page we produced record net revenues of billion in the third quarter up versus a year ago driven by significantly higher net revenues in consumer banking for the quarter despite the market headwinds management and other fees of billion were relatively flat sequentially as net market depreciation was largely offset by strong client net inflows private banking and lending net revenues reached a record of million up yearoveryear due to higher lending and deposit balances consumer banking revenues were million in the third quarter nearly double the third quarter of reflecting higher credit card balances and improved deposit spreads moving on to page total firmwide aus ended the quarter at trillion combined firmwide management and other fees in the third quarter rose yearoveryear to billion on page total firmwide net interest income of billion in the third quarter was up relative to the second quarter due to higher rates and increased loan balances our total loan portfolio at quarter end was billion up slightly versus the second quarter as growth in credit cards and wealth management loans was offset by a decrease in real estate loans our provision for credit losses was million primarily driven by growth in our consumer lending portfolio net chargeoffs and worsening economic indicators particularly in europe the credit quality of our wholesale lending portfolio remains resilient as reflected by minimal net impairments in the quarter on the consumer side though we are seeing some signs of credit deterioration and an increase in chargeoffs our credit performance remains in line with our expectations that said were closely monitoring the portfolio and actively adjusting our underwriting in light of the softening macroeconomic outlook lets turn to expenses on page our total quarterly operating expenses were billion our compensation ratio yeartodate net of provisions was through the third quarter our compensation and benefits expenses are down over relative to quarterly noncompensation expenses were billion year overyear increases were driven by ongoing integration and run rate expenses related to the nnip and greensky acquisitions million in litigation reserves and higher transactionbased expenses we remain highly focused the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 on operating efficiency as we previously discussed we are actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts and we expect that these actions will become more fully reflected in our results over time turning to capital on slide our common equity tier ratio was at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach up basis points sequentially and representing a basis point buffer to our current capital requirement in the third quarter we returned billion to shareholders including common stock repurchases of billion and common stock dividends of million as a reminder our gsib surcharge will increase by basis points in january bringing our cet1 ratio requirement to we will continue to target a buffer of to basis points above this requirement in conclusion our solid third quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise we are mindful of the uncertainty and volatility in the markets and we will prudently manage our resources and maintain a risksensitive orientation as we continue to serve our clients i share davids enthusiasm about the opportunities ahead of us the further alignment of our businesses will help us drive the organization forward successful execution of our strategic priorities growing management fees maximizing wallet share and scaling platform solutions will further strengthen the firm and unlock shareholder value with that well now open up the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we will take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello thanks very much appreciate your macro comments i was wondering in private markets specifically i feel like those markets have changed as well or hopefully only temporarily but great time to be a private lender in private credit and youre big in that but not as great time to be in private equity for marks or capital raising so wonder if you could talk as both manufacturer and distributor just maybe a state of the union in general and then if you could weave that into your thoughts on your gross alternative fundraising target of billion and billion in management fees thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so thanks for the question glenn and look at a high level the targets remain in place and our confidence in the targets and then our ability to deliver those targets is high and were very focused on them we continue to make progress in the fundraising and we highlighted it in the context of the script and we have a series of offerings that are coming over the course of the next months and while certainly id say the private equity fundraising environment is more constrained and the alternatives fundraising environment is broadly more constrained i would highlight just the fact that we have a very very broad franchise a very very diverse sets of offerings and that there is a lot of opportunity that comes out of an environment like this and i actually think from a vintage perspective the opportunity to put money to work in this environment when we look forward and then we look back is probably something that will be very very attractive the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 were obviously shifting the macro environment as weve talked about thats going to create headwinds around valuations and theres been a big reset on the other hand if you have dry powder or you have interesting strategies you highlighted some i think lending strategies could be quite attractive in this environment i think theres good institutional capital and candidly good capital out of the wealth channel is still available to support these strategies so were taking a longterm approach to growing these businesses the businesses are growing nicely weve set targets that well continue to meet and i know that if we have a good broad offering for our clients that well continue to have success in this and candidly this is one of the reasons why were integrating asset and wealth management is because we believe by putting these platforms together we have the best eye and the best breadth to really understand where the opportunities are to serve our clients and also where the opportunities are for good performance denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc and glenn i can add from an alternatives perspective we mentioned growth of billion in new commitments in the quarter that brings yeartodate to billion just shy of billion we now sit at billion towards our increased billion target we continue to migrate our alternatives into aus that sits now at billion of alternatives aus so despite the environment we continue to make progress towards our fundraising goals particularly in alternatives glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks for that denis and david maybe a related followup on rwa its down a little bit in the quarter i appreciate ph its fair and lots of volatility so that has a bunch of moving parts but curious your just overall approach towards optimizing rwa and then maybe a specific question related to ficc financing and it was up its great making good money does that come at same better or worse return on riskweighted assets as intermediation denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc glenn thank you thank you for the question on rwa as you note our rwas were down slightly on a quarter overquarter basis we have been focused on managing our rwa footprint tightly within that number youll see reductions in terms of marketbased rwas and increases in credit rwas and were being very thoughtful about the way in which we allocate and deploy rwa capacity to drive efficiencies as well as scale franchise growth activities and ficc financing happens to represent an attractive opportunity in terms of our rwa deployment and so thats one of the reasons why you see that ongoing focus in the growth of the ficc financing line operator thank you well take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start with a question on expenses you spoke of expense mitigation efforts as part of the broader realignment strategy whats the level of noncomp inflation we should be contemplating recognizing were still dealing with inflationary headwinds you alluded to more proactive measures to mitigate expense growth just want to get a sense if the goal is to actually slow noncomp growth or to deliver absolute reductions in expense david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thanks for the question steven ill start at just a high level and then denis will go through some details with you in terms of how were thinking about it but i do think there are different factors that are leading to the expense growth but one is there is definitely an inflationary pressure thats affecting certain aspects of the business were obviously looking at that and thinking about that carefully i do think were making investments across the platform particularly in certain technology infrastructure and thats having an impact that will be more medium term we think those are important investments that we need to make at the same point though given the environment were extremely focused on trying to mitigate any expense growth to the degree we can now therere going to be headwinds given the natural inflation that sets in but why dont i have denis kind of walk through and break down some of the different components that weve been focused on denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so if we take a step back we look at our overall level of operating expenses yeartodate theyre down compared to the prior yeartodate period they are up sequentially drivers obviously across both comp and noncomp if you look at the noncompensation growth over the course of the last year roughly half of that is attributable to expenses associated with the integration and run rate of nnip and greensky together with change in litigation so that is representing about half the balance as david indicated we do see some impact from inflation we do see the impact of higher levels of transactionbased expenses but we are also taking actions to reduce expenses within the overall non compensation category where we can you may note that on a quarteroverquarter basis we reduced our professional fees something that we indicated in our previous earnings release and were going to continue to think very very disciplined about the way in which we deploy noncompensation expenditures striking the balance of driving towards our efficiency ratio but as well as making the investments that we think are appropriate to continue to strengthen and grow the firm steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great and maybe just a question for my followup on the equity investment portfolio given the challenging equity market backdrop certainly the revenues came in better than expected theres also been some increased scrutiny of more favorable marks on some of these private equity portfolios and just given the better revenue outcome and a pretty heavy concentration in areas like tmt and real estate which have come under pressure i was hoping you could speak to what drove some of the better results this quarter anything idiosyncratic worth flagging the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thank you steven let me cover that in a bit of detail for you so obviously on the million equity line theres a number of components as we mentioned previously we have a public equity portfolio and that contributed positively north of million for the third quarter and then also within the private portfolio you have a number of things that are going on within our private equity portfolio we have roughly billion of event driven gains that came through over the course of the third quarter whether those be capitalraising activities strategic transactions or the operating expenses from our ph cies those positive gains were offset by markdowns in our private equity portfolio particularly in tmt and consumer operator thank you well take our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess maybe just going back david you mentioned in your prepared remarks about rationalized spend the segment realignment makes a ton of sense just give us a sense from the outside as we think about the rationalization of the spend does this lead to you achieving your strategic targets around costs roe at a faster pace or do you have a high degree of confidence that you get there relative to the previous plan and understanding the core tenets are the same but just give a sense of just your confidence in achieving those targets despite the market backdrop as we look forward and how this realignment supports that david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure and so first i just want to amplify it i said in the script we continue to be committed to our forward targets and theres nothing about the environment or the way were running the firm that doesnt lead us to believe that we can deliver on the targets that we would set over the course of the coming years whether the return target or also the efficiency target that weve set and were tracking a number of kpis and continue to be very focused on that the realignment of the firm is really driven by our ability to serve clients that is the most important thing thats coming out of this and weve been very very focused on wallet share and client share broadly weve made real improvements over the last few years and we think this further aligns those goals and that capability now in this realignment we are making a purposeful shift as we think about our directtoconsumer business and id just highlight that one of the things that changes by aligning our directtoconsumer business with our wealth business and people that are on our wealth platform is that the forward spend for customer acquisition is meaningfully lower and so of course as you look at that thats helpful in the overall returns of the firm but i would highlight that just the numbers either way we were looking at it are small in the context of our businesses our core businesses banking and markets asset and wealth management and i dont think any of this was having a big impact on our ability to meet our targets or the pace at which well meet our targets we do think and this is why were doing this that this is a better way for us to align the business and move the business forward and so thats why weve made this purposeful shift but again id just amplify these are not big numbers in the context of meeting our targets when you look at the overall performance of the firm the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and i guess just one followup in terms of you talked about organic growth opportunities in private lending given market dislocations therere a lot of asset values that have been hit too just remind us in terms of ma where youre focused on and just appetite to execute ma david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well at the moment we continue to be extremely focused on our businesses and the growth and the things that we have on our plate in front of us as you know we made a couple of acquisitions were in the process of integrating those acquisitions in and at the moment thats where our focus lies as we go forward in the future if there are opportunities to accelerate the growth particularly in asset wealth management well consider them but at the moment we remain very focused on integrating these acquisitions and executing on the things that we have in front of us operator thank you well take our next question from christian bolu with autonomous christian bolu q analyst autonomous research good morning david and denis just trying to better understand the point of the reorganization of the businesses what does this reorg mean practically for the businesses what can they do today that they couldnt do before the reorg i guess when i listen to you other than scaling back in cost consumer acquisition im struggling to understand what the broader point of the reorg really is david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc christian its interesting i know you follow us closely and weve been talking about a variety of things and if you go back to our investor update at the beginning of the year we highlighted a lot of the synergies between banking and markets and how we were working to get those client activities more closely aligned we also highlighted in our update at the beginning of the year the synergies between asset and wealth and then when john spoke at the bernstein conference in may we put a big big spotlight on the synergies we thought bringing asset management and wealth management closer together so its not that by doing this that were doing something dramatically different weve been driving the firm in this direction with respect to client service and one gs for a number of years and we think as weve done that and weve looked at that and weve learned we think by organizing the firm this way it makes it easier for investors to understand and see how we look at our client set and how were operating against that client set and so we view it as a natural progression that strengthens our ability to deliver for clients and so thats why we moved in this direction thats what the big business is banking and markets and asset and wealth management on platform solutions we have a bunch of these platforms where were making investments we think theyre very interesting theyre growing they require more focus this alignment of them allows us to shine a brighter more transparent light on them and were very committed to driving them to profitability and a meaningful contribution over time and we think by organizing this way it allows us to maintain that focus on what is a small piece of the business but one that i think in the future allows us a differentiated opportunity to serve our corporate and institutional clients the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 christian bolu q analyst autonomous research got you okay maybe switching onto consumer maybe just looking back over time what lessons have you guys learned in terms of ph trying to execute in this business if i think about the thesis that goldman outlined as far back as in terms of building a full scale digital bank that was a great thesis right its actually played out youve seen a bunch of smaller new banks like square and chime really do a good job of building that one could argue that theres been some execution challenges for goldman in consumer youve had multiple leadership changes it feels like youre sort of breaking up some of the businesses and putting them in different parts of the organization so just stepping back a little bit here kind of what lessons have you learned in terms of executing on consumer and how do you take that going forward to build that business david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think christian the steps that were taking today are reflective of the learnings and whenever you innovate and you build new platforms and new things youre always going to be constantly looking and examining what youre doing and saying what have we learned how can we do this better id say im very proud of the team in our consumer business the marcus team broadly when i look at the deposit platform thats been built and the growth from zero to over billion of deposits over the last six years we have million customers on the platform i think we have very unique credit card technology thats differentiated we have a couple of extraordinary partnerships i think that when you look at all of that together we have some very good things but one of the things i think weve learned is that the ability to scale that and attract customers in the directto consumer business needs to be focused in a more directed way and so were focusing it by aligning it with our wealth business where we have access to millions of people and so i still see a terrific opportunity to take what are really really interesting digital products and in being aligned with our wealth business provide those products and services to clients and customers of goldman sachs in addition i think the partnerships that weve built also provide good opportunities for us to serve corporate clients with very very interesting digital capabilities and allow them to ultimately serve their end customers or clients and so yes there have been bumps not everything has been perfect i think that always happens when youre innovating but i also think weve built meaningful things that create meaningful opportunities for the firm as we go forward and in particular our ability to have a more diversified funding base and a big deposit platform that we can grow from here and an ability to offer wealth customers on our platform a broader array of services i think positions us well as we move forward operator well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc can you hear me okay okay great david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah we can hear you fine thank you betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great so two questions first a followup on the conversation just now is there anything that youre going to be fading as a result of this is there any part of the consumer business that youre not going to do anymore and i know you did the renegotiation with apple card i guess its through if i got it right and how is that restructured in a way to enhance your ability to generate revenues from that because i know you mentioned on cnbc this morning david that the balances arent being carried as much as had been expected david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so to the first part of your question betsy theres no aspect of the services that were offering to consumers that we dont continue to offer the big thing though is this alignment that we are aligned with our wealth business and that gives us an audience of millions of people that we can focus on with lower customer acquisition costs and their lower forward spend as we grow or add those services to people with respect to the apple card i made a statement this morning that we extended and amended the partnership with apple id just highlight that its very unusual for two partners to change one of these partnerships in the middle of a partnership like this but i think it goes to the fact that its a very very strong partnership where theres a lot of opportunity but because we were doing something innovative with the technology and embedding the technology in apples platform there were different results than we had expected i mean one of the positive results thats very very good for consumers is consumers have an ability and therefore are more actively paying down their credit card balances more quickly that led to different modeled results in terms of what kind of balances you have with a certain population on the platform and so in looking at the forward arrangement the platform has to work for both us and apple apple believed that we believed that and so we made changes to make sure that this is attractive for both of us as we move forward and continue to try to deliver really valuable digital financial wellness and access to consumers that are on the platform betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then just on a separate topic but the question is on the gsib surcharge and i think over the past couple quarters youve highlighted how youve been looking to take action to bring your gsib score down such that you the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 dont trip into that next bp bucket in jan could you give us a sense as to the progress there this quarter and if that goal is still on the table for year end denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc betsy its denis thanks for that question our position is we remain focused on targeting the gsib same message we gave at the end of the second quarter were one quarter closer to the end of the year we are on track to achieve the gsib level as we indicated in the second quarter i would reiterate now that should the opportunity set with clients or the market generally change we could pivot away from that but from where we sit right now today looking into year end we remain focused on the gsib operator thank you well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i have two easy questions that ill requeue for but ill ask my harder questions now if im able to requeue on slide you say that consumer revenues were billion for the last months what were the earnings for the consumer and the reason i ask that is theres all sorts of news articles and im not sure if its ever been confirmed by you guys but that youve been losing a lot of money and i just dont know if thats the case or not or to what degree and that makes sense in any startup that youd be investing along the jcurve and you lose money at first and you make money down the road so how is consumer from a financial standpoint from an earnings standpoint panning out in relation to your original expectations david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so mike were not giving complete transparency on a fourwalls look at the consumer business it doesnt make money at the moment im not going to go further than that but what i will say the deposits are hugely valuable and we do believe as the platform scales and you stop the pace of growth that weve had so youre not front loading reserves the same way then what were doing will deliver accretive returns to the firm and so we continue to feel very very confident with that not everything thats reported is accurate and reflects the journey of innovating and building something like this but we continue to feel very good about what weve built were making some shifts that we think play to our strength and strengthen our ability to accelerate the pace of these tools this activity contributing to the firm id highlight that the overall performance and the firm the firms overall performance and our targets remain the same and so again i know this gets a lot of attention i understand why it gets a lot of attention and thats all okay but weve set targets were going to deliver on those targets and were going to make investments in things that we think strengthen the firm and this is one of them mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right i guess the reason i ask the question i mean look for the last years right your strength has been serving your corporate relationships investment banking and look thats your legacy too the strength there and so when im looking at this third division platform solutions the first two divisions are based on how you address the clients based on distribution one goldman sachs whereas the third division platform solution sic solutions seems to be based on how you manufacture solutions so that just seems like a little disconnect so just a little bit more color i know youll talk about it at your newly announced investor day but the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 distribution and this is based on how you manufacture clients im just trying to reconcile that with the goldman sachs history and what youre doing elsewhere david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i appreciate that mike and look its very generous of you to account years of history but id just highlight the firm looked very different in the than it looked in the than it looked in the the firm continues to grow and change i joined goldman sachs in and it was years ago as a partner and it was a fraction of what goldman sachs is today so were a big business we have very big businesses and of course our investment banking and markets business is core to who we are it will continue to be core to who we are it drives our earnings and performance it drives what were associated with weve built over a number of decades a very very powerful asset and wealth management business what were bringing together today were the fifth largest active asset manager in the world and we think weve got a real opportunity to grow that i understand now that people accept that as being core to goldman sachs when we started back in the i dont think people viewed it as core but we also have engineers here and were doing some very very interesting things as the world is changing and the world is evolving with technology after the financial crisis the regulatory structure came and we became a bank and it was clear we needed deposits and we needed to diversify our funding and so what platform solutions represents is a handful of smaller business opportunities relative to the scale of goldman sachs that were investing in where we think we have a capability to serve our clients weve i think done some very interesting things in transaction banking as we outlined i think this card partnership is very very interesting in terms of what its allowing us to do and so we think its an opportunity its still small relative to goldman sachs its less than but we think its an opportunity worth investing into as we continue to broaden the scope and scale of what goldman sachs can do for our clients and thats kind of the way were thinking about it operator well take our next question from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thank you for taking my questions ive got two questions and one is on the consumer pivot but i feel like we need a break so let me just ask the other one first you guys how should we be thinking about the efficiency ratio this year the last six months have been tougher revenuewise and so the medium weve been above your mediumterm target of noncomp expense is a little sticky you guys laid out some of the things that youre trying to do there but do you think that do you fully expect that youll be hitting your ratio target this year on the efficiency front denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc brennan ill take that for you thanks for the question as david indicated earlier we remain very committed to our firmwide targets and we look to achieve them over the mediumterm the efficiency ratio is one of those we will not necessarily hit that target each and every year this is probably one of those years theres not been a top quartile environment for performance but that being said we are pulling the levers that we can pull youll note that our compensation and benefits on a yeartodate basis is down and were going to make sure that we size that to account for our performance in line with our pay for performance orientation but also with respect to the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 our targets and finally remaining mindful that labor markets remain tight and our talent is important to our franchise but you can see the movement were making in our compensation yeartodate as a component of the overall efficiency ratio and then on the noncompensation side that remains very much a focus and we will look to continue to make progress on noncomp with a goal to driving towards the efficiency target david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc but brennan just to amplify were committed to our efficiency target it was never meant to be a target that would be hit absolutely in every single year exactly the same way and so this obviously has been a tougher operating environment and its having an impact but we remain committed to the target and are operating the firm to deliver on that target brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that color and then for the next one just to come back to the pivot to consumer and apologies for hitting on it again but i think its important because want to understand strategically you all laid out in early david you laid out a lot of the goals and aspirations around consumer and building this consumer business it seems like this shift is a toning down of some of those aspirations previously we had heard that you were looking to launch some general consumer banking to complement the deposit business and while you said before that youre not changing the current offering not completely clear if youre continuing to go forward with the rollout and all of the original aspirations that you were targeting and just to be honest when i speak with a lot of investors on goldman sachs very few are excited about the consumer business so i wouldnt necessarily say that a pulling back in the aspirations would necessarily be negative i just want to try and understand strategically what the new direction is david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah no brennan i appreciate that theres no question that the aspirations probably got and were communicated in a way that they were broader than where were now choosing to go and we are making it clear that were pulling back on some of that now we have built some things we have a checking platform we have an investing platform and if you are aligning this with wealth and you have wealth customers wealth customers can use those things but its very very different to have those capabilities and be able to use them on a broad wealth platform versus directly marketing them to independent consumers en masse and i think one of the big learnings over the last few years is that were better to play to our strengths and narrow our focuses i think the technology we built is very very good and we can now connect it to millions of people that are on our platform and that is a narrowing of the focus for sure it is a purposeful shift tried to make that clear in the script and i think it plays to strengths that we have but we are a bank we need deposits we are a wealth platform people that are on our wealth platform want an ability to leave money here actually if you look at other wealth platforms they have banking capabilities attached to them and so i think were strengthening our ability as a broad wealth platform and i want to amplify this workplace wealth channel where we have access to millions of people is a very very interesting place for us to attach some of the stuff that weve now built the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 so i think weve made a significant investment we are narrowing our focus very clearly but i still think there are opportunities for us and again i want to amplify our other businesses are performing they drive the overall results this is still small in the overall scheme of goldman sachs but we think that its additive and thats why were trying to focus it and drive it forward in the best way and i appreciate the comment that shareholders havent been excited about it and that certainly affects some of our decisionmaking operator well take our next question from devin ryan with jmp securities devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc thanks good morning i want to ask a question just on investment banking ma financing markets have obviously become a little more complicated recently and seen some negative marks on recent deals im just curious whether you feel like some of that friction is just transitory or whether financing markets are really starting to maybe become more concerning and crack a bit and then kind of interrelated just how much thats weighing on your outlook for ma advisory business where it sounds like backlogs are still solid but you need functioning financing as well david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah i would say devin at a high level were tightening economic conditions very very quickly and when you tighten economic conditions it has an impact on these things i think the impact lagged a little bit i do think theres been a big reset in the capital markets for ipos for debt financing people have to get their minds around the valuations the cost of capital i think that reset is occurring history would tell you that capital markets generally dont stay closed no matter what the environment they dont stay closed for years at a time because people have to move forward they have to operate their businesses they have to raise capital and so they adjust to the new environment that said the prospects for economic growth are uncertain in and so i think therere going to be headwinds so i expect a more cautious or a bumpier capital markets and ma environment as we head into i think we need more clarity on the trajectory of the economy and the trajectory of inflation to really see all that stuff accelerate from the levels its operating at today devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yeah okay great a quick followup here just on deposits deposit rate in marcus right now i think the delta versus many of your bank peers is widening and so im just curious what youve seen over the last couple of months here especially as customer cash ph hoarding has been accelerating in the industry and then whether you can just share some expectations from here around what you expect in kind of marcus deposit gathering just as rates potentially continue to move higher from here denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thank you thank you for that question so maybe just some observations across deposit flows across the firm given the changing environment on the consumer side of the equation continuing to perform and outperform our expectations our focus is on continuing to attract deposits we are deliberately positioning ourselves within the competitive envelope and so in such a fashion that we can attract deposits we do not intend to be the price leader but we do intend to remain competitive its obviously an entirely digital offering were not the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 burdened with a lot of other costs and infrastructure and so we have some flexibility to position our pricing in such a manner that we can attract deposits to continue to grow the firm obviously this is something that will change over the entirety of the cycle but thus far its outperforming our own expectations on the other hand institutional activity through transaction banking were observing that that is more competitive there are more deposits that people are seeking to raise through those channels being more disciplined and so we do see more competition for raising deposits through that channel relative to the consumer channel operator well take our next question from dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning wanted to ask about wealth management you had a strong quarter for inflows versus i think what we saw in the industry was a bit of a slowdown sequentially looked to be a record inflow quarter for alts for you can you just talk about the momentum in that business and how to think about maybe growth from here denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so thank you for acknowledging that obviously on top of that our overall growth in management and other fees at up yearoveryear in the last quarter almost billion were well on our way to both our billion total and billion alternative fee targets and the reality of attracting these types of flows over this period in time a lot of that has to do with work and performance and track record that has been done previously some of these particular flows have longer lead times others shorter lead times but looking at both the alternative commitments that we were able to secure in the quarter looking at the change to our alternatives aus on the quarter which was very strong and then looking at our inflows across the more traditional channels were very pleased with the activity that we saw in that regard over the course of the third quarter and were very focused on continuing to drive that going forward daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc got it and then just in the consumer business both the consumer banking as well as the private banking and lending accelerated quarteroverquarter and you gave a handful of reasons but just thinking about the trajectory for those businesses even in addition with the realignment just trying to think about momentum on more of the shorterterm basis the stepups quarteroverquarter were quite strong so just some color a little additional color there would be helpful denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thank you obviously for the firm overall loan growth was just about billion quarteroverquarter but we do continue to see good opportunities particularly across the wealth management segment you saw better growth in that segment its a high quality lending opportunity for us and were leveraging an existing set of relationships and existing franchise thats very much in place weve obviously been recognized for our advice and solutionoriented way in serving those clients but we are finding that increasingly theyre looking for us also to provide financing to them and so were making sure that the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 were very focused on supporting them as holistically as possible and we see good opportunities on the forward to continue to grow those types of financing activities operator thank you well take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning many keep calling for the normalization of fixed income trading and i think it was last quarter you guys tried to frame what might be a good kind of medium longerterm level but obviously it continues to be and i am wondering has it reset higher kind of permanently due to likely higher inflation higher rates and usually that does bring higher volatility even if things settle down from here are we just looking at a structurally bigger and maybe materially bigger wallet than we thought not too long ago david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc look matt i think its always hard to predict but i think if you want to go back to the period before the pandemic i do think the level of client activity in a shifting macroeconomic environment has created a larger wallet i think one of the things that we benefited from and we continue to try to amplify this is weve grown our wallet share by over basis points since so were benefiting from the fact that the available wallet is larger and has been larger for the last couple of years but in addition with basis points of wallet share growth thats also improved our position so i do think clients are active we have a truly global franchise its broad its deep were very very focused on our market share position with leading clients i cant tell you what the future will bring but i just think that our franchise is extremely well positioned whatever that opportunity is our relative positioning against that opportunity to serve our clients is strong matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and in terms of the share gains how much of it so obviously it sounds that its youre leaning into the business with some investments including in financing but how much of it is maybe mix has been favorable to you and theres also been some pullback by some global peers as theyve been building capital and you obviously have enough to lean into it david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well its hard to pull it apart i mean if global peers are pulling back capital and resources that they allocate the people who are committed to it the big us players are going to benefit but i actually think the big thing that has driven our share gains the fundamental shift in the client philosophy of the firm the investment in the one goldman sachs ethos i think its had a material impact on our global markets business and i think its affected our shares i think the team in that division has executed in a very very strong way against that its improved our client relationships improved our positioning materially with the top clients i know you know that we set out a few years ago and said we had of the top that we were in the top with were now in the top with over thats been a very coherent a very focused effort to improve our client positioning i think thats had the biggest impact on our market shares the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 operator thank you well take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning david you talked about the need for deposits and if i recall back on your investor day one of the advantages for growing deposits was the improvement in your funding costs from wholesale funds with the rise in rates has that improvement lessened at all and second i think you had a goal of getting to in terms of funding half of the business with deposits and then wholesale funds and where do you stand on that denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so thank you gerard its denis so i think as indicated in some of the previous comments and outlined at that original investor day we are very focused on diversifying the funding mix also benefiting from the pricing and the stickiness of that channel weve developed since that period of time multiple deposit funding channels the digital marcus platform is one of them transaction banking is another in terms of that original goal of changing the mix we have achieved that we continue to be very very focused on moving that mix youll see on a quarteroverquarter basis that we have improved our deposits reduced our other unsecured funding so we remain focused on that its an attractive source of funding for us it also fits within the overall strategic realignment that weve been discussing gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup in your outlook david for whats going on in the capital markets business obviously the tightening that were all seeing is it as straightforward in terms of an improvement of the fed finishing with its monetary tightening and markets rebound quickly after that or do you see other factors that have to play in aside from whats going on of course with ukraine and russia and the european situation david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i dont think its simple for sure gerard i think its still pretty uncertain i do think we have to get to a point where we better understand the trajectory of inflation and therefore understand the trajectory of economic growth going forward the fed is executing and has set some very very clear goals as to where theyre going in a tightening cycle in the near term but i think theres uncertainty whether or not that will get inflation to a place where the policy will shift going forward and so i think were in an uncertain period i think that this warrants and were operating the firm this way with a sense of caution as we look forward but well have to watch closely but i dont have a clear answer for you as to whether or not if we get to the feds current trajectory well be in a place where economic growth prospects will improve as we look ahead from into i think thats still relatively uncertain operator thank you well take our next question from jeremy sigee with bnp paribas jeremy sigee q analyst exane sa united kingdom the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 thank you youve covered a lot of ground so ive just got a couple of specific followups please the first one goes back to cost topic and the head count increase in this quarter i just wondered if thats mainly seasonal with new joiners because i think the acquisition impacts were all already in the prior quarter so i just wondered if it is just seasonality really thats driving the head count increase and just how you think about that relative to the cost focus that youve been talking about for a couple of quarters now denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thank you for that in terms of the quarter change a lot of that change is attributable to campus hires based on time of year our new classes of starting professionals occurs during the third quarter we mentioned an intention to slow hiring velocity we have indeed followed through on that topic and references to strategic growth initiatives thats to say that slowing down the velocity of hires does not mean that were not still making hires in the market we have a lot of attractive opportunities to grow the firm and theres a lot of talent inside of goldman sachs theres also talent outside of goldman sachs that we can add to our team to continue to strengthen our ability to deliver for clients so we are focused on overall levels of head count growth looking to slow it but also remaining nimble and strategic with respect to strategic hires jeremy sigee q analyst exane sa united kingdom thank you very clear and then a separate followup just on the wealth management the workplace wealth management which i feel is a sort of its a new thing for you to talk about in such a high profile way do you have all the building blocks that you need to be successful and to grow that space or the bits that youre going to have to build to make a success with that david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc appreciate the question jeremy i mean this is actually something that we started building decades ago it started with the acquisition of ayco im going to get the date wrong but it was in the early i think it was approximately to years ago which allowed us to basically affiliate with corporate partners to provide wealth management services and financial counseling to executives then spread into the organization more broadly than just senior executives but that business has grown nicely and that was the building block under which we built this and today i think we deal with more than half of the fortune and hundreds of companies in the fortune its through that platform and then with the addition of united capital which was an investment we obviously made a few years ago that gave us a broader high net worth footprint thats allowed us to do more to service more of the clients in the corporations we were partnered with and then weve added digital solutions that weve been building over the last few years that allow us to reach any member of the team so we have certain companies that were partnered with where were offering financial wellness to hundreds of thousands of employees which ultimately can become wealth clients or depositors or come on to our platform more broadly so the building blocks are in place theyve been put in place over a long period of time and over the last couple of years weve started to execute much more directly across that and youre right now were amplifying what weve invested in there and trying to highlight that and make sure that some of the other pieces that weve built are aligned with that so we can strengthen it and grow it but we think its a big opportunity for the firm the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 operator well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thanks for my followup i guess the word for the quarter is resiliency if im hearing you correctly and its really remarkable that you havent had a big blowup thats come back to hit you or your peers so far but how are you protecting yourself against i guess the likelihood theres going to be some thirdparty problem that could ricochet back on you im talking about outside of say the largest us banks which have reported now and then the other thing is the resiliency of the backlog is quite amazing in the face of all this volatility in stock and debt market declines how long does that last thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so mike look appreciate the question and its a good question id just start by the fact that this firm has a very very strong risk management culture and is always focused on risk management risk mitigation and trying to look around corners and think about whats coming so ive tried in a number of questions today to highlight that i think things are uncertain that were being cautious i think weve taken a number of actions inside the firm as we think about our risk lens in a variety of places and we think about rwa allocation as we think about things that were doing to try to operate as lets be prepared for a more difficult environment now obviously we have exposure to that because were a large financial firm so you cant protect yourself from that but theres no question that were trying to take actions to make sure were well positioned i think you saw during the quarter that we grew our capital buffer during the quarter i think thats reflective of a conscious decision in this environment to run a little bit more cautiously a little bit more conservatively weve been watching whats been going on in markets across the uk and when we see things like that we reflect back and spend a lot of time digging in and thinking about other places where those things can be amplified and so were extremely focused on issues like that and i would just say that i think the world is fragile at the moment and its uncertain and were operating through that lens were a big financial institution so we have exposure if there was bigger volatility or bigger problems we could potentially have exposure to them but on the other hand i think that weve got a very broad global deep franchise and were well capitalized and were very focused on this and were going to continue to be zealous in our risk management practices to make sure on a relative basis whatever the world throws at us well serve our clients well and operate well for ourselves and our shareholders operator thank you at this time there are no further questions please continue with any closing remarks carey halio headinvestor relations the goldman sachs group inc yeah thanks everybody for joining us today and thank you for all the questions if you have any additional questions that come up please dont hesitate to reach out to me thanks so much
