sachs group inc and may not be duplicated reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent i am joined today by our chairman and chief executive officer david solomon and our chief financial officer denis coleman let me pass the call to david david michael solomon chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thanks carey and good morning everybody thank you all for joining us im pleased with our performance this quarter theres no question that the market environment has gotten more complicated and a combination of macroeconomic conditions and geopolitics is having a material impact on asset prices market activity and confidence we see inflation deeply entrenched in the economy and whats unusual about this in particular period is that both demand and supply are being affected by exogenous events namely the pandemic and the war in ukraine in my dialogue with ceos operating big global businesses they tell me that they continue to see persistent inflation in their supply chains our economists meanwhile say there are signs that inflation will move lower in the second half of the year the answer is uncertain and we will all be watching it very closely given all of this we are seeing shifts in monetary policy and those shifts will continue to tighten economic conditions i expect theres going to be more volatility and theres going to be more uncertainty and in light of the current environment we will manage all our resources cautiously and dynamically our risk management culture and capabilities should help us navigate this environment for our clients and for the firm that said there is nothing about this environment that changes our strategy and we are committed to our mediumterm targets we have a strong client franchise and we remain focused on providing differentiated service we benefit from the diversity of our businesses and our global footprint in light of the environment were certainly taking deliberate action on capital and expenses but we will also continue to invest to strengthen and grow our firm let me now turn to our financial results in the second quarter we produced net revenues of billion and generated earnings per share of an roe of and an rote of our book value per share finished the quarter at up yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter in investment banking we remain the number one advisor in ma and equity capital markets and though capital markets activity has declined our dialogue and engagement continues to be strong this quarter again reaffirmed our strategy to be the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 global broad and deep in our leading global markets franchise each week clients turn to us for our market expertise and execution in a dynamic and uncertain environment our strong performance this quarter demonstrates the diversification of our businesses across the segment im very proud of the fact that we have consistently executed on our strategy to improve our market share as we help our clients manage risk and meet their financing needs in this environment our onbalance sheet investments face significant headwinds after achieving record high net revenues in our management and other fees were resilient as we remained focused on growing feebased revenue streams across our asset management and wealth management segments and further reducing our onbalance sheet investments as markets allow and in consumer we are prudently expanding our platform to serve individuals digitally both organically and through partnerships before turning it over to denis let me spend a minute on capital particularly in light of the recent federal reserve stress test results i was glad to see the improvement in our stress capital buffer especially because the test this year was more challenging than in the past this is a reflection of the progress we are making in our strategic evolution that said we will advance our efforts to improve the capital density of our businesses in order to reduce our capital requirements over time following the stress test results our board of directors also declared a increase quarterly dividend to per share this follows an increase of in and over in in addition with regard to our gsib buffer while we made a conscious decision to grow our balance sheet to support client activity over the last three years it is our current plan to target a gsib surcharge this intention is driven by the recent operating environment as well as client needs should these change we will naturally reevaluate in closing i remain confident in our ability to navigate the market environment serve our clients and create long term value for shareholders despite the uncertainty we face we continue to drive this organization forward by executing our clientoriented strategy and delivering accretive returns consistent with our targets over time ill now turn it over to denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail denis p coleman chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david good morning lets start with our results on page of the presentation in the second quarter we generated net revenues of billion and net earnings of billion resulting in earnings per share of we reposted a return on common equity of and return on tangible equity of turning to performance by segment starting on page investment banking generated revenues of billion down versus a year ago financial advisory revenues were billion our global ma franchise remains strong as we closed over deals for approximately billion of deal volume in the quarter further strengthening our numberone lead table position equity underwriting net revenues were million industry volumes remain muted given the ongoing market volatility despite this we remain ready to deliver for our clients once the market backdrop for equity issuance improves debt underwriting net revenues were million where we saw lower levels of market activity amid sharp rate increases in the quarter while our investment banking backlog is down from the peak levels last year it is still higher than it has been at any point in our history prior to we feel good about the quality of our backlog based on our healthy levels of strategic dialogue that span from technology and innovation to defensive repositioning of client portfolios but we may see some softening if the challenging market environment persists the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 revenues from corporate lending were million up versus a year ago driven by hedge gains associated with our relationship lending book that more than offset approximately million in marks on certain commitments from our acquisition financing activities we saw continued growth in our transaction banking business the platform now serves nearly clients and has roughly billion in deposits at the end of the second quarter generating approximately million in revenues yeartodate moving to global markets on page segment net revenues were billion in the quarter up yearon year growth in the quarter was driven by significantly higher client activity as we facilitated risk intermediation for clients amid a volatile market looking at ficc on page revenues were billion in the second quarter in ficc intermediation we saw a increase in revenues with three of our five ficc intermediation businesses posting higher net revenues versus the prior year reflecting the strength and breadth of our diversified franchise our macro franchise remained incredibly active as we helped clients navigate rising rates tightening monetary policies and continued volatility across commodities this drove strong growth in net revenues and rates commodities and currencies and while revenues were lower yearonyear in credit and mortgages clients remain engaged meanwhile in ficc financing we saw considerable strength in mortgage lending and repo activity which helped deliver record results moving to equities net revenues in the second quarter were a solid billion equities intermediation revenues fell yearoveryear due to a more challenging market making environment activity was also impacted by lower levels of primary issuance volumes equities financing revenues of billion rose versus a year ago and versus the first quarter increased volatility across global equity markets drove higher demand for various forms of financing from our clients growth in equities financing coupled with record performance in ficc financing is a reflection of our strategy to grow client financing activities which represented nearly of our overall global markets revenues this quarter moving to asset management on page asset management net revenues of billion were materially lower than the second quarter of last year growth in management and incentive fees was more than offset by net losses from our onbalance sheet investment portfolio management and other fees totaled billion up yearoveryear this increase was driven by the rolloff of fee waivers on money market funds and the addition of billion of incremental aus from the recently completed acquisition of nnip which contributed roughly million of management and other fees this quarter equity investments generated losses of million driven by sharp market declines during the quarter more specifically on our public equity portfolio we experienced roughly million of net losses reducing the value of the portfolio to approximately billion at quarter end in our private portfolio we produced approximately million of net revenues we generated eventdriven gains of over million from various positions across the portfolio additionally we had operating revenues of approximately million related to our consolidated investment entities these revenues were partially offset by approximately million of marks particularly in the technology and consumer sectors we remain focused on our strategy of migrating our alternatives business to more thirdparty funds and in the second quarter we raised over billion of commitments we also harvested over billion of onbalance sheet equity investments the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 the pace of our realizations this quarter was influenced by both macro and micro drivers with persistent volatility in equity markets making it more difficult to harvest assets net revenues from lending and debit investment activities in asset management were million down versus a year ago as net interest income of million was partly offset by marktomarket losses of approximately million due to spread widening ill turn to consumer wealth management on page we produced record net revenues of billion in the second quarter up versus a year ago driven by higher net revenues in both wealth management and consumer banking for the quarter wealth management and other fees of billion rose versus last year driven by higher placement fees and higher average assets under supervision while private banking and lending net revenues of million were down relative to record revenues last quarter revenues were up yearon year due to higher lending and deposit balances consumer banking revenues were million in the second quarter rising versus last year and versus the first quarter now moving to page total firmwide aus ended the quarter at trillion combined firmwide management and other fees in the second quarter rose yearoveryear to billion we expect our fee revenues to continue to grow as we progress towards our fundraising and management fee targets we laid out earlier this year on page total firmwide net interest income of billion in the second quarter was down modestly relative to the first quarter due to lower net interest income in global markets our total loan portfolio at quarter end was billion up billion versus the first quarter primarily due to growth in corporate wealth management and residential real estate loans our provision for credit losses in the second quarter was million up from million in the first quarter provisions in the quarter were primarily due to growth in our consumer lending portfolio and higher modeled losses due to economic indicators worsening quarteroverquarter overall our portfolio fundamentals remained strong as reflected by minimal impairments across our wholesale lending book on the consumer side while we do not see signs of meaningful credit deterioration we are closely monitoring the portfolio and are taking mitigating actions as appropriate now lets turn to expenses on page our total quarterly operating expenses were billion down year overyear our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was quarterly noncompensation expenses were billion yearoveryear increases were driven by integration and run rate expenses related to the nnip and greensky acquisitions as well as continued investments particularly in technology and higher levels of business activity together nnip and greensky contributed approximately million to non compensation expenses this quarter given the challenging operating environment we are closely reexamining all of our forward spending and investment plans to ensure the best use of our resources as a result were taking a number of actions to improve our operating efficiency specifically we have made the decision to slow hiring velocity and reduce certain professional fees going forward though these actions will take some time to be reflected in our results we are keeping in mind however that while were being disciplined about our expenses we are not doing so to the detriment of our client franchise or our growth strategy turning to capital on slide our common equity tier one ratio was at the end of the second quarter under the standardized approach down basis points sequentially and representing an basis point buffer to our current capital requirement as we enter the second half of the year this past quarter we returned billion to shareholders including common stock repurchases of million and common stock dividends of over the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 million as david noted earlier in the third quarter our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend by to per share looking ahead we will remain nimble in response to both ongoing opportunities to support clients and the current operating environment while we will continue to deploy capital in our business where returns are accretive we are actively evaluating share repurchases in light of our current stock price in conclusion our solid second quarter results reflect our ability to navigate volatile markets while actively supporting our clients we remain confident in our financial position capital base and liquidity which will help us serve clients as they navigate these challenging markets and we are committed to executing on our growth strategy and delivering for our shareholders with that well now open up the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we will take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much i apologize if i missed it within your remarks but can you tell us what the pl contribution from the billion or so in dispositions as a private equity book was and i want to ask that in the context of when people see the marks on the private portfolio being pretty small relative to what happened in the public markets they want to see why you have confidence and what about the portfolio gives you such confidence that it wasnt as affected by whats going on in the public markets thanks so much denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thanks glenn its denis let me take that for you so we made a number of remarks with respect to the composition of our onbalance sheet equity investments and specifically we made note of eventdriven gains of approximately million during the quarter we noted a markdown of million approximately across consumer and technology sectors and what i would say to give you some context is we do look at the portfolio on a very very granular basis its comprised of both corporate and real estate assets and we look at the performance for example of our private equity names their top line performance on average theyre growing north of and if we were to take a look at some public comparable albeit an imperfect one those are growing in negative fashion and so it reflects the initial equity investment selection as well as the ongoing performance of those particular businesses glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay very much appreciated and then one quick followup obviously ecm dcm pipelines are down a lot given what weve seen but you noted that your advisory backlog is actually up i wonder if you can expand on that a little bit because we havent seen a lot of activity these days in ma thanks the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc loom what i would say in terms of the overall advisory performance you can see the headline number which is quite significant at billion and we have our sustained number one market share position across both announced and completed actually increasing our lead versus certain other competitors i think this is an environment where our clients are turning to us and looking for advice on how they can execute on whats particularly strategic for them the nature of the transactions that they may be considering could very well be different in their complexion than a year ago but nevertheless our robust global client base have strategic needs and they trust us to help them navigate the market so we do continue to see high levels of strategic dialogue and client engagement theres no question if the overall operating environment were to deteriorate further or if confidence were impaired we could see some softening even in our advisory activities but todate theyve been strong on the underwriting side thats much more a reflection of the current capital markets receptivity and again strong levels of client engagement we like our backlog but it is there will be a better market environment required in order for many of our clients to choose to access those markets and for us to deliver on certain aspects of that backlog glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks denis denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thanks glenn operator thank you well take our next question from christian bolu with autonomous christian bolu q analyst autonomous research good morning david and denis so you posted pretty strong results this morning you continue to take market share in trading roe yeartodate is just pretty good given the backdrop but man you guys tone sounds very very cautious so what exactly are you worried about in the macro backdrop maybe just more specifically and how does that impact your thinking on a timeline to achieve mediumterm roe targets david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc ill start christian i dont know if denis will add anything to it i think our tone is cautious because the environment is uncertain the environment is very uncertain we dont have a crystal ball to tell you exactly how monetary policy will navigate the inflationary environment that exists but theres no question that economic conditions are tightening to try to control inflation and as economic conditions tighten it will have a bigger impact on corporate confidence and also consumer activity in the economy i think its hard to gauge exactly how that will play out and so i think its prudent for us to be cautious the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 now that said i think one of the things you saw this quarter is we have a much broader much more diverse much more global much more resilient business than we might have had years ago and we benefited from that in the context of the quarter so we feel good about our ability to operate i would say that at the moment while theres a lot of uncertainty clients are still relatively active denis was just talking about ma activity and our clients are active capital marks activity is obviously down this is not an environment where everyone is looking to shed all risk but its certainly an environment where people are more cautious about risk so we continue to monitor it but i think its prudent and appropriate for us to be cautious and if you go back and listen to some of the words we said were evaluating things with respect to resources were being flexible and being prepared to be nimble in case the environment gets worse by the way we dont know that the environment is going to get worse the environment might get better too so i just think its a time where prudence and caution makes a lot of sense now with respect to our targets i want to be clear we set mediumterm targets for and we still plan on meeting those targets we dont see anything in this environment that will prevent us from meeting those targets im not going to speculate on a quarterbyquarter basis as to what the trajectory looks along the way but i would say in whats been certainly a very difficult first half of the year if you think about the headwinds we faced in both public equity markets because of the war in ukraine and the unwind of the business in russia et cetera i think there have been some exogenous events in this first half of the year that certainly created bigger headwinds than we might see in other times going forward so we remain comfortable and committed to our targets and well continue to move forward expeditiously to meet them christian bolu q analyst autonomous research okay thanks maybe switch over to the consumer business wanted to get your latest thinking on that business how is the profitability curve tracking how are you thinking about that business going into a downturn and then just strategically given the pressures on fintechs out there i wondered if theres any sort of opportunity here to try to grow faster either organically or inorganically david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i appreciate the question and i guess id just step back and id highlight that weve been building a business from scratch here it certainly takes investment and weve been making investment and weve been pretty clear that we have a longterm strategy to create a leading digital platform in the consumer banking business now weve been at it as i think you know for five years weve built out a really good deposit platform weve built out an interesting cards platform with very interesting technology we have a loans platform we have some technology around an invest platform and weve also added greensky with that portfolio of product offerings weve told you in our update that we expect greater than billion of revenue in you can obviously see this quarter that were making progress on revenue in the business and as we noted i think when we spoke in february at the update we said the vast majority of the build costs associated with the products that will achieve that billion target are in the ground and so i remind you of that comment on a yeartodate basis the vast majority of the investment relates to building credit reserves as we grow the business and just a reminder cecl requires very very significant upfront reserve build so we continue to feel good about the progress were making and we expect this business to generate accretive returns to goldman sachs over time and were committed to the journey that weve set out on to make sure that we do just that over time the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 christian bolu q analyst autonomous research thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i just the one thing i realize christian that i didnt touch on is were very very focused on the credit box and thinking about the credit box during the early part of the pandemic when there was enormous uncertainty we tightened the credit box meaningfully as denis highlighted in his opening remarks we dont see significant indications of credit deterioration in the consumer but given tightening economic conditions were watching that very very carefully and to the degree that we saw different signals in the short term we would adjust our credit box very dynamically christian bolu q analyst autonomous research thank you operator thank you well take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning david good morning denis david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so maybe just as a followup on the credit discussion i was hoping you could speak to your appetite for loan growth you noted that you could be very dynamic but just given some of the upward pressure on provision from both growth math as well as the macro deterioration i was hoping you could just provide some ranges as to how we should be thinking about through the cycle provision expectation in a more normal operating backdrop denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc steven thanks its denis let me maybe provide a little extra color around the provisions just to help provide some context so as we noted with respect to the consumer portion thats really driven by ongoing growth in the asset origination as opposed to deterioration of credit quality and on the wholesale side we obviously model the macroeconomic outlook and when we do our work across our various scenarios over the course of the first quarter into the second quarter our outlook for the forward is for a less robust set of macroeconomic variables from gdp growth to employment levels to inflation probability of recession possibility of stagflation et cetera and so we reweighted our scenarios and we took a level of provisions that we thought was appropriate on our wholesale book relative to the outlook that we see we continue to invest in our franchise we think its important the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 to continue to support our portfolio of corporate clients but we will continue to provide appropriately along the way steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful and maybe just for my followup for david on capital you did cite plans to manage to the lower gsib surcharge of i know that you were on a path to potentially migrating as high as i was hoping you could speak to the specific actions you are taking to mitigate the gsib score whether we should be contemplating any level of revenue attrition from those actions and does your ability to manage to that lower gsib surcharge inform the more aggressive tone that we heard on buyback david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc appreciate the question and let me try to give some clarity to our thought process as monetary and fiscal policy were extremely loose and extremely forward the opportunity set with our clients was expanding very very rapidly in the context of that in and we saw opportunities to deploy resources serve our clients and therefore expand meaningfully the revenue opportunity and the profit opportunity for the firm that environment has certainly shifted in and while our clients are still active theyre not active to the same degree that they were in and you can obviously see that in the revenue environment not just with us but across the street in stating that where were focused on controlling that resource growth and kind of bringing it back to a level we are making a forward assumption thats consistent with what weve seen in the first half of the year id note one of the things that i said in my comments was if there was information that would lead us to a different conclusion well obviously evaluate that and change that but based on the experience weve had over the last six months and the revenue opportunity were capturing we think we can continue to capture that revenue opportunity thats available based on client activity by being a little bit tougher on our resource allocation and that should free up potentially some capital for shareholder return or potentially other investments but i would think at this point in time looking at that and denis highlighted in his remarks with the stock trading where it is were certainly thinking about that very carefully as we evaluate our capital return going forward for the rest of the year operator and well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning one of the other areas for capital deployment obviously is in growing the consumer business and i know youve got greensky under the belt the general motors card apples doing gangbusters so just wanted to get a sense from you as to how youre thinking about other opportunities you might see for either new partnership opportunities or is there balance sheet acquisition capabilities there david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so thanks betsy so look i think what id say with respect to that is there are lots of partnership opportunities and lots of people coming to us given our relationships our technology et cetera that are interested in doing things with us at the same point weve done a bunch over the course of the last five years to build this business and as weve said we put a couple of big partnerships in the ground in cards weve started an invest platform were now working to integrate greensky the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 i think our intention at the moment is to be focused on integrating these successfully and making sure we execute at a very high level certainly as we get out into and well be more open to other partnerships and other meaningful things going forward but at the moment were focused on really executing on what weve put forward which included as we had highlighted launching checking later in the year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay and then separately on transaction banking youve given us a lot of good metrics along the way on how that business has been building out maybe you could update those a little bit for us today as well as give us a sense as to how the higher rate environment is impacting your returns there i would think youre running ahead of plan based on that or expected to by yearend and how do you redeploy that fully into that business line or elsewhere thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc hey betsy its denis maybe ill take that one as you suggest we feel really good about the transaction banking business its progress yeartodate and the forward we continue to improve on each of the metrics that weve been reporting on so nearly clients deposits at around billion revenues yeartodate million and importantly we continue to improve the percentage of the deposits that are operational operational and fully insured deposits are now north of at the end of the second quarter so well continue to focus on growing overall clients balances and continuing to incrementally operationalize that business its obviously a profitable business already and its a business as david highlighted that benefits from leveraging the relationships that we have already inside the firm to grow it incrementally operator thank you well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess im thinking in terms of the tradeoffs that you have to make david in terms of both capital and expenses on capital i mean you talked about a broader diverse resilient more annuitylike business stream but then we get the fed stress test results and you guys finish in last place albeit better than last year but still last place so i guess the regulators dont see it the same way that you do and that the tradeoff between managing for lower regulatory capital requirements versus the loss of revenues and then the other dynamic decision is managing expenses lower as you said youre taking a closer look at that the tradeoff between ensuring good profit margins but at the risk of maybe losing revenues if things come back the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc im not sure there was a question there i think there was a fair balance of exactly what we wrestle with i mean i would highlight while its a fair comment that our scb is higher than everyone elses because of our current business mix if thats what you refer to as last place i would comment for the stress test we came in first place is that we were the only firm that actually saw their scb decrease and many institutions saw their scb increase very meaningfully now i dont take that as a victory lap were early in the journey of taking assets off our balance sheet but i still do think mike one of the big attributes we have as you look ahead over the next few years is we are going to continue to make that business much less rwa dense and i do think as indicated by the step forward we took in the stress test that we will hopefully take other steps forward in future tests as we continue to change that mix im not satisfied with where we are on the journey of making the firm more feebased and more resilient but i am satisfied that weve made meaningful progress and i think the results this quarter show the diversity of the business in a positive light in what was a really tough operating environment and so as someone who has followed the industry and our firm for quite some time i think the performance in this environment is reflective of the beginning of that evolution but youre exactly right we have to constantly balance between investing in the future and providing resources to serve clients when theyre active and driving those shareholder returns that kind of is our true north of what were trying to drive toward so yes its a balance i think were trying to strike that balance appropriately and were going to continue to be laserfocused on making sure we do as good a job as we can striking that balance effectively mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and on the second part as it relates to expenses it sounds like youre going to not quite plan b but youre getting ready in case you need a plan b how long do these deals stay alive before it pencils down and they just say all right were going to wait for the next cycle i mean it seems like with every month that passes the chance that capital markets will rebound close to where it previously was declines how long do you and the markets have before things just stay lower for longer david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i guess id say a couple of things we always i think were very nimble allocators of resources financial resources human resources we try to have a very very flexible nimble approach and so of course weve expressed early in the call we think this is an uncertain environment and were going to be cautious of course we will have plans in hand to the degree the environment gets worse with respect to capital markets activity i think i told you at the beginning of the year in our january call on january that i did not expect us to see the level of capital markets activity we saw in anytime soon and i wouldnt call that as normal so when you talk about capital markets activity going back to what we saw in the past couple of years i dont think were going back to that anytime soon but i do think if you look at capital markets activity kind of average levels over the last seven years take a period five years seven years and look at average levels id be very surprised if we dont get back to some average level of capital markets activity sometime over the course of the next few quarters the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 and history would just tell you that that doesnt mean it might not take a little bit longer this time if things get increasingly uncertain but generally speaking one of the things that affects capital markets activities is people have to reset their mind around valuations they have to reset their mind around capital costs and that happens relatively quickly because people have plans they have commitments they have to invest and as soon as they get their minds around that and they adjust which takes a few quarters they get back into the market thats available to them and so id be very surprised if we dont see as we head into some sort of a normalization of capital markets activity and we might not because the world could get worse and it could stay more difficult longer but its not baked in the cake in my opinion that were headed to a super negative environment but it is uncertain it is a little bumpy and so were going to proceed cautiously operator thank you well take our next question from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning david and denis thanks for taking my question id like to start on expenses so you indicated that youre adjusting the investments but it sounds more like thats about slowing the hiring outlook so maybe the impact there has a lag and were more talking about yearend or even into and more on the comp side so curious about number one whether thats a fair interpretation and then number two best way to think about noncomp if we adjust for the legal charge and what and maybe some higher bce this quarter is this the right jumping off point for noncomp or might some of that expense diligence that you flagged also put some downward pressure on the noncomp line thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so two components to your question and obviously we manage the firm to an efficiency ratio looking at both the comp side and the noncomp side of the equation i mean as you would have seen through the first half of the year we have taken compensation expense down significantly billion less comp expense in the first half versus the first half last year and at the same time we did see some increases on the noncompensation side of the equation as we look forward into the second half as we indicated yes slow velocity of hiring decreased replacement of attrition probably reinstating our annual performance review of our employee base at the end of the year something that we suspended during the period of the pandemic for the most part and just being much more disciplined and focused on utilization efficiency of our human capital resources given overall environment and youre right some of that will take time to reflect itself through the pl so i think thats the right expectation you are correct in anticipating that were also looking at noncompensation expenses and taking some actions there as well to slow the rate of growth and reduce certain components of our noncompensation expense some of them are dovetail well with investments that were making to grow the firm and some of those activities well obviously look to continue we may slow the pace but well continue to grow the activities that support the growth of the firm and there are other items in noncompensation expense occupancy as an example or travel expenses where we actually see the impact of inflation impacting the overall level of expense and so thats just going to require us to work harder to manage towards our overall efficiency target which is i think the comments and references that both david and i have made with respect to our orientation on the expense front the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thanks for that color denis appreciate it and for the second question im curious weve seen you talk a lot about ma and how obviously your investment bank franchise is holding up really well but just sort of a question around the environment weve seen riskier debt issuance slow a lot yeartodate and started to hear chatter that availability has actually continued to become challenging so curious whether or not thats also what youre seeing and whether or not theres any concern that that availability that sort of availability might become a challenge and lead to some pockets of stress for some of the more levered borrowers david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i think its a good i think its an appropriate thing to look at carefully id say at the moment real availability issues are limited to some very very stressed borrowers or some very out of favor sectors but i do think sometime people confuse availability with acceptance of the new and reset price and so i would say at the moment the bigger thing thats slowing down capital markets activity is people accepting of the new price environment ultimately companies need to raise capital they find that new clearing price but i do think that if the environment stays very very difficult from an economic perspective there are certain sectors where availability is an issue and there are a couple of them now id point to retail as one where certainly capacity and leverage levels have constrained meaningfully and so i think well watch this very cautiously but again i would tell you that theres a mindset when you go through this and a resetting thats going on and i think ultimately markets find clearing prices and capital markets theres certainly plenty of capital plenty of liquidity available in markets for people who are doing reasonable deals at reasonable prices the most levered companies will have a tougher time in this environment denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc i mean another thing i would add just that very same environment also presents an opportunity so as an example in our ficc financing business there are a number of clients who are looking for financing they have important transactions to execute attractive assets to have financed and to the extent that theres less availability of financing across the street that presents an opportunity for us given the way that were currently positioned our focus on financing and the franchise relationship we have with those clients that are big users operator thank you well take our next question from devin ryan with jmp securities devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great good morning david and denis question on the ria custody offering can you just talk a little bit about the evolution of that offering and whether we should expect a more aggressive acceleration in the marketing of that offering in the coming quarters theres been some recent press just suggesting that you guys are better integrating that with the broader goldman capabilities so love to just get an update on your thinking there david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well we obviously we made an acquisition in the space its something that were focused on as an opportunity for the firm but id say at this point the resources and the size and the scope of that are relatively small but i the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 think as we look forward over the course of the next three to five years it will be an area that we see opportunity in and well turn more focus to expanding thats why we made this acquisition and we think its an interesting opportunity for us devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay great thanks and then a followup here denis just touched on this but we heard a lot about trading client deleveraging through the second quarter that drove down prime brokerage and margin balances at a number of firms in the industry it didnt seem to impact your trading or financing results but can you give us any sense of where you think we are on deleveraging more broadly is there another lag that could exist here or are clients now operating at lower levels of leverage relative to recent history and how that interplays with your trading outlook as well denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i appreciate the question i mean connecting it back to some of the comments that davids made looking back over the course of the last couple years weve gone through an extraordinary period we see an ongoing transition into a new type of market environment im sure there are some clients that have looked to delever themselves and position for the current operating environment we continue to see very high levels of client opportunity there was a lot of engagement in the second quarter particularly in the macro businesses clients approaching us to help them mediate risk other clients looking for financing which is why we had record performance in ficc financing and i think as we look forward were obviously starting the quarter with a buffer to our minimum capital position i mean very focused on the environment to deploy capital in the second half we think there should be some good opportunities and there may be clients that incrementally turn to us to help them navigate the opportunity so i think we feel well set up and were optimistic about the opportunities with clients going into the second half operator thank you well take our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning i guess just wanted to follow up on the strategic targets david so you said multiple times on the call that you dont see any reason why goldman wont achieve i think your rote target to by when we think about that i think where investors struggle with is just the lack of visibility on the revenue side and how quickly you can flex expenses just give us a sense of when we think about yeartodate rote about the journey from ph year to your targets how much of that is reliant on the macro getting better versus do you think structurally the business can continue to become more profitable without any improvement in the macro david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well if we stayed in a macro environment look its a good question i understand where the question comes from if we stayed in a macro environment like the first six months of this year for the next five years i think it would have an impact on the journey with respect to returns although i do think that wed be more resilient and probably do better than the base perception would be of the industry broadly by the way not just goldman sachs if you really had that kind of environment because the world would adapt to that kind of environment and people the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 would make changes in their businesses on the expense side et cetera over time to make sure that they could deliver appropriately for shareholders i dont expect i think we had a very i think this has been a very difficult six months and there have been some big headwinds in the course of the six months i dont expect to have the same headwinds in the next months or the next months now that doesnt mean that the environment couldnt be worse or there couldnt be different headwinds that create different issues but i think to kind of take whats going on with some of the exogenous impact over the course of the last six months and translate it as a three or fouryear thing forward thats just not our base case thats not our base case and if that was our base case we would be much more aggressive and forward with respect to expense changes investments in the business et cetera but thats not our base case and so we continue to move forward with the base case where were pretty confident that we can deliver the level of revenues with an expense base and a resource allocation that we can adjust and be nimble with to deliver those returns and id just highlight that in the first half of the year were not that far off from what we said we need to accomplish over the next three years ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thank you for that and then just recognizing its very challenging to predict trading activity but when you think about just good volatility versus bad volatility do you see just given all the uncertainty in macros for central bank actions etcetera in terms of ficc trading things to remain strong as we think about the back half of the year just whatever is in your crystal ball david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc the good volatilities bad volatility has never been an expression that id like i think about our business in markets as a business were serving our clients and were making sure that were meeting their needs thats why weve been very focused over the last three four years on really improving our approach to our clients really improving our market share with our clients adding financing as a capability to our clients which is much more resilient and therefore puts a base in the revenues that did not exist before now that doesnt mean that there cant be volatility in the intermediation part of the business im not going to make a forecast as to what looks forward but i think the investments weve made in our client focus in our market shares and our financing business all give those markets businesses more balance as we go forward there will be environments where clients are more active and we can capture that and therell be environments where clients are a little bit more quiet but were prepared to serve them and i think if we get out of quartertoquarter and continue to look over threeyear periods theres a very big business that generates very accretive returns and serves our clients well operator thank you well take our next question from dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning dan the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 operator pardon the interruption well move on to matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi some good details on your loan portfolio and loan loss reserve on slide and just wanted to ask specifically on the consumer book youve got about reserve to loans obviously chargeoffs are only and change but how much of that reserve is kind of factoring in growth seasoning or just more tough macro environment how would you frame that denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i think i would frame it actually as a combination of those factors so your seasoning point is fair as well its a less aged portfolio if you will than certain other broadbased consumer portfolios theres an element of seasoning theres an element of the overall macro environment that sort of come together to cause us to conclude that thats the appropriate place to be you do make reference to chargeoffs obviously firmwide theyre flat quarteronquarter wholesale down slightly consumer is up a little bit but those are some of the factors that we also take into account and look at matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and i know earlier you were asked about through the cycle provisioning and anything specifically on consumer chargeoffs as we think about those portfolios what you would expect once you have the seasoning and what those levels would be not in a recession but just more kind of through the cycle denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah i mean i think through the cycle is where we are in terms of our observation so whether the impact presently is more a function of normalization from really quite exceptional set of conditions in the last year the starting point the overall health of the consumer is very strong the credit environment for consumer has been very very benign and so i think you need to take stock in sort of where youre starting from obviously if the environment continues to persist more negatively and certainly if we were to move towards recession then we would expect an increase in that regard operator thank you well take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning david in the past couple of years you guys have focused on reducing your equity portfolio so that the volatility in earnings would be less can you share with us where you are on that progress are you at a level that youre comfortable with or you still got some more to go in reducing that portfolio david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 sure ill answer at a very high level and then im going to have denis walk you through some very specific details i am pleased with the progress but not comfortable with where we are comfortable is probably the wrong word im pleased with the progress id like us to continue to accelerate to make more progress and i think were going to do were going to make progress over the course of the coming months our progress weve made a lot of progress it was slowed also by the fact that we went through a period in where the value of a lot of these assets grew very meaningfully even as we were selling things but why dont i have denis walk you through denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc some highlevel numbers that we put out there denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so couple things i think were well on our way in terms of the journey we remain completely committed to the progress and the direction of travel youll note there were no particular additions over the course of the last quarter we continued to move down certain of the onbalance sheet equity exposures we have a detailed asset byasset plan that we are executing on and looking at our results coming through ccar obviously the fed recognized our strong ppnr but we also suspect that the way that they concluded the ultimate decision on scb had something to do with the nature of our onbalance sheet equity investments and the shock that they choose to apply against that portfolio and so thats incremental affirmation that weve selected the right strategy and then if anything we should continue to move forward maybe even accelerate the rate of disposition remaining mindful of the overall environment and the ability to execute but i think the direction of travel for us and our commitment to reducing those exposures is completely unchanged gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and just as a followup maybe you guys can give us a little deeper color into the ecm business obviously according to the deal logic numbers the first six months of this year we all know were very weak and market conditions we recognize as being the driver but david you alluded to maybe that price expectations are coming down was it primarily just the volatility that pushed everybody to the sideline was it lower valuations that pushed them there what did you guys see as the biggest drivers for these really weak numbers for the industry not just for you folks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah i think its a combination i think its a combination gerard of all those things you had a meaningful decrease in values in the public market and in the private market you also had real volatility and so people go down the road doing an ipo its like a tanker its heading down the road it takes months and months and months of preparation sometimes years of preparation and you get your mind and you get with all the shareholders that youre going to go public at a particular value particular price and all of a sudden the value of the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 the price is or less and the whole tanker just stops they cant turn on a dime and get everybodys mind reset and so i think a shift in valuations and that volatility had a big impact the period in terms of the anemic nature of equity capital markets issuance kind of reminds me of the period in where we obviously had enormous growth in equity capital markets activity in and and then in march you started to see a real change in market and valuation it was the beginning of decline in the nasdaq where the nasdaq ultimately went down im not saying that thats going to happen again here but really equity issuance shut off in late and was a really really anemic year for equity issuance and started picking back up again in and so theres a reset process with all of this and i think were on the journey of peoples expectation around valuations being reset operator thank you well take our next question from jim mitchell with seaport global jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning can i just i just want to circle back to your comment on managing to a gsib and sort of your comments about lower client activity versus last year but i think on the flip side you guys are pretty optimistic around grow still growing the financing business it looks like trading assets are up yearoveryear or flat yearoveryear loans are up balance sheet is up so is this just something about balance sheet and rwa growth slowing or is there specific areas you think will shrink or you can cut denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so i think were looking at this holistically a lot of the questions speak to our strategic plan our ability to execute to hit targets over time given the environment that were in right now we see an opportunity to target a gsib and obviously is for the benefit of and beyond but the decision to be made is a current one and so in terms of our ability to target that level given what weve seen in terms of various balances levels of client activity et cetera we think we can do that reasonably efficiently weve had discussions with our business leaders they know that thats the plan thats what theyre working on david did make a comment that should the environment change significantly and the needs of our clients change we would reevaluate but the current plan is to target that level of gsib and weve been obviously growing resource deployment and that will constrain some of that resource deployment but in addition to targeting a gsib we can at the same time deploy other financial resources to attractive client opportunities so our expectation is that well be able to continue to support clients with attractive and accretive business activities while targeting a gsib jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc can you help us a little bit with the specifics of what youre actually targeting or is that youre unwilling to disclose that denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc we are currently targeting a gsib were not putting out a particular gsib score that were targeting the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 operator thank you well take our next question from dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks try this again here just wanted to follow up on the billion of commitments in thirdparty funds that you highlighted in the quarter clearly theres still strong momentum as you think about this market backdrop and the outlook for that are you seeing any change in behavior or signs of slowing david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i would say dan at the moment at a high macro level were not seeing significant change in behavior when you look at the institutional capital allocators around the world the institutional capital allocators have significant allocations obviously if the overall values of the portfolios decrease the allocation percentage would shift and so that will slow down capital raising but i think for leading big global platforms that are multiproduct and global i still think theres a secular growth trend around alternatives thats very very attractive probably not at the exact same pace and ebullience that you saw in but certainly a strong secular growth trend that kind of moves forward with respect to allocations of capital by big institutional allocators into the space i would say one of the places that a number of participants in the market we have not been as bigger participant but theres been a lot of retail flow into the alternative space and there my insight there is that is slowing but its not turned off and its still adequate and from what i can see in our private wealth lens that we have with a very very highend private wealth business theres still significant interest in alternatives as people move forward so something to watch if the environment got much worse maybe that would change but at the moment not seeing indications if the changes are meaningful daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc great and then just as a followup on the balance sheet outlook and the harvesting of some of the investments you have historically given a line of sight number on these calls given i would assume the market backdrop in the shortterm theres just less outlook or clarity around what you might be looking to sell here denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc i think thats right so last quarter we gave a line of sight of approximately billion which is what ended up happening right now line of sight is less than billion just given the overall environment thats what we see it right now operator thank you at this time there are no further questions please continue with any closing remarks carey halio headinvestor relations the goldman sachs group inc we just wanted to thank everyone for joining the call obviously if any other questions arise feel free to give me a call directly thanks so much well speak to you soon operator
