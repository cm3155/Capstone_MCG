banking platform of the future where we are enabling over million customers to take control of their financial lives last week we introduced my gm rewards card and we look forward to the addition of greensky later this quarter and the launch of checking later this year at our investor day in early we committed to do three things grow and strengthen our existing businesses diversify our franchise into new businesses and operate more efficiently as shown by todays results we are delivering on these objectives underpinned by our relentless focus on our clients notwithstanding the solid progress weve made todate we remain committed to driving this organization forward with a keen eye on growth and diversifying our business mix these efforts will strengthen our ability to elevate the firms return profile relative to before we took over as a leadership team as i look ahead we have great opportunities to grow the firm as we scale our four growth initiatives we invested in these initiatives with the belief that each of them has the potential to add tens of billions of dollars to our market cap over time given it has now been two years since our investor day we plan to address the details of the next phase of our execution next month before i turn it over to denis let me provide some thoughts on the operating environment ill start by saying there continues to be a fair amount of uncertainty theres no question that the recent surge in omicron cases contributed to market volatility however im encouraged by data that shows that omicron wave is less severe and has already peaked in some countries therefore it is expected to have less of an economic impact my view is that covid19 will be endemic and as a society we will find a way to live with it supported by the efficacy of vaccines and new treatments for our firm this means being flexible and dynamic with our protocols to adapt to this new state of the world while also enabling the majority of our people to be back in the office safely more broadly theres no surprise that the recent surge in cases is putting even more pressure on supply chains inflation is persisting in many countries and major central banks are beginning to raise rates notably the bank of england late last year and the federal reserve is now expected by our economist to implement four rate hikes in based on my experience it makes sense that coming out of the recent period of easy monetary policy inflation may be above trend for some time and in the near term inflationary pressures may continue to intensify before they start to decrease i also believe that we could see more volatility as these easing policies are unwound which will likely have an impact on economic growth asset prices and client activity in such a dynamic environment i want to reiterate the importance i place on investing in the people of goldman sachs it is their tireless dedication to the firm to our clients and our culture of collaboration that drove our record performance this year and i want to take this opportunity to express my profound thanks for all their hard work it remains a personal priority of mine that we invest in their success in we demonstrated this commitment not only for our payforperformance approach but also by supporting our people in a variety of other ways including new benefits and investments in health and safety we believe these investments are critical components of our people strategy support our culture and position us for success in the long term in conclusion as i said at the outset we had a very favorable backdrop in and we outperformed but make no mistake as we move into with excitement and enthusiasm for the opportunities ahead we remain committed to executing on our strategy and delivering for our shareholders in any market environment the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 let me now turn it over to denis to cover our financial results for the year and the quarter in more detail denis p coleman chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david good morning lets start with our results on page of our presentation in the fourth quarter we generated net revenues of billion net earnings of billion and earnings per share of this contributed to our record performance for the year across revenues earnings and eps turning to performance by segment starting on page investment banking delivered outstanding results in with revenues rising almost versus very strong results last year in the fourth quarter investment banking produced its highest quarterly revenues of billion financial advisory revenues of billion were just shy of last quarters alltime record we maintained our number one league table position in completed ma for as we have for of the past years and participated in over trillion of announced transactions during the year driving a volume market share of ma activity remains elevated across geographies and industry groups with particular strength in tmt industrials and healthcare were also optimistic around the forward outlook for ma with continued strength in corporate confidence coupled with an accelerated pace of transformation across industries this is further bolstered by high levels of investable capital from financial sponsors in equity underwriting we produced our fifth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of billion we ranked number one globally for the year with volumes of roughly billion across more than deals representing volume market share of in debt underwriting net revenues were million with our strong performance supported by record industry leverage finance volumes as well as solid assetbacked activity we start the year with an investment banking backlog that is significantly higher than where we started despite record revenues during the year moving to global markets on page segment net revenues were billion in the quarter down yearon year full year revenues of billion rose driven by an increase in equities which posted its best annual results since equities performance was helped by our continued progress in deepening our relationships with the top clients as well as higher financing revenues consistent with our growth strategy turning to page our ficc businesses generated billion of net revenues for the fourth quarter the decline in ficc intermediation versus a year ago was largely the result of significantly lower revenues and rates products amid lower marketmaking opportunities as well as in credit primarily on decreased activity these declines were partially offset by strong revenues and currencies on solid marketmaking results and as the divergence in global central bank policies led to higher client activity particularly in emerging markets ficc financing revenues of million were up meaningfully yearonyear driven by mortgage lending balances consistent with our strategy to support the financing needs of clients across the franchise total equity revenues of billion were down versus solid results in the fourth quarter of as an increase in equities financing was more than offset by a decline in intermediation average balances in prime rose to a new record though financing revenues of million were lower sequentially in the absence of outsized opportunities to extend liquidity to clients as mentioned last quarter equities intermediation revenues fell year onyear driven by significantly lower performance in both derivatives and cash amid fewer marketmaking opportunities the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 moving to asset management on page fourth quarter segment revenues were billion and for the full year asset management generated record revenues of billion helped by significant gains in equity investments particularly in the first half of the year fourth quarter management and other fees totaled million which were burdened by approximately million of fee waivers on our moneymarket funds as rates rise in the us we expect the majority of these waivers to cease equity investments produced net revenues of billion driven by over billion in gains on our billion private investment portfolio and roughly million in operating revenues and gains related to cies partially offset by million of losses on our billion public portfolio moving ahead to page we show the continued progress in harvesting onbalance sheet equity investments consistent with our longterm strategy to reduce capital in this segment and increase feerelated earnings since we laid out this plan at the beginning of weve actively harvested positions of billion which have been partially offset by markups on the portfolio of billion and additions of billion which include early fund facilitation the implied capital associated with the total dispositions across both private and public equity positions since our investor day is nearly billion additionally we continue to have line of sight on billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to billion of capital reduction moving to page consumer wealth management produced revenues of billion in the fourth quarter contributing to record full year revenues of billion that rose versus the prior year in wealth management quarterly management and other fees rose to a record of billion up versus the third quarter and yearonyear supported by strong client inflows private banking and lending net revenues of million for the quarter contributed to record full year results of billion which were helped by increased loan penetration with our ultrahigh net worth clients consumer banking revenues were million in the fourth quarter reflecting higher credit card loan and deposit balances yearoveryear sequential results were impacted by higher interest expense on our uk deposits where we raised rates ahead of the bank of england rate increase as david mentioned we now have over million customers across our global consumer platform up roughly versus last year and gross loan balances are up by almost we expect loan growth to continue in given the pending acquisition of greensky and the recent launch of the my gm rewards card page shows the growth in our firmwide assets under supervision and management and other fees which is a key component of our forward strategy as david mentioned total aus stands at a record trillion following record longterm net inflows of billion during the year strengthening our position as a top active asset manager and a top alternative asset manager globally firmwide management and other fees for the fourth quarter rose yearoveryear to a record billion contributing to full year management and other fees of billion importantly weve been able to grow these fees at a compounded annual growth rate over the last three years this fee income is a key component of our strategy to diversify our business mix and deliver more durable revenues for shareholders on page we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments total firmwide nii was billion for the fourth quarter higher versus a year ago reflecting lower funding expenses including a greater reliance on deposits and an increase in interestearning assets as weve noted previously our business is modestly assetsensitive we expect that higher rates in along with the continued expansion of interest earning assets will provide a net benefit to our results the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 our total loan portfolio at quarterend was billion up billion sequentially and billion for the full year the growth in our loan book this year primarily reflects higher balances and conservatively structured warehouse lending where our typical loan to value is and an increase in highquality wealth management loans provision for credit losses of million reflected lending growth during the quarter primarily in apple card as we expand our consumer business we expect the provision to grow next year reflecting increased lending and financing activities across the firm turning to expenses on page our total quarterly operating expenses were billion for the full year operating expenses were billion driving an efficiency ratio of roughly well below our target and reflecting our ability to exhibit operating leverage on compensation our philosophy remains to payfor performance and were committed to rewarding top talent in a competitive labor environment our full year compensation ratio net of provision of is basis points lower than quarterly non compensation expenses of billion rose yearoveryear as we continued to invest across the franchise to accelerate the strategic evolution of the firm nearly twothirds of the increase was driven by higher professional fees technology spend and market development related costs we also incurred million of expenses related to litigation during the quarter turning to capital on slide our common equity tier ratio was at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach up basis points sequentially in the quarter we returned a total of billion to shareholders including common stock repurchases of million and nearly million in common stock dividends we also adopted saccr in the fourth quarter which impacted our cet1 ratio by basis points as noted on the last earnings call looking ahead we expect further pressures on our capital position including the upcoming closing of the nnip acquisition and other deployment opportunities given these headwinds we currently expect buybacks in the first quarter to be at or around the levels in the fourth quarter as it relates to our funding plan based on current expectations we intend to issue materially less benchmark debt for this year versus though we will remain dynamic with respect to business needs and market opportunities in conclusion our solid fourth quarter and record results reflect the strength of our client franchise and our successful strategic execution as well as the upside inherent in our business model amid a constructive operating environment as david noted we look forward to providing you with an update next month with more detail around our strategic objectives and targets importantly our results bolster our confidence that the execution of our strategic plan will diversify our business mix and drive more durable revenues for shareholders with that well now open up the line for questions the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from glenn schorr from evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello ill try to ask indiscernible question as efficiently as i can indiscernible so you noted the basis points of exprovision operating leverage indiscernible someday capital markets revenues might actually moderate and two noncomp up how much of that indiscernible relative to a high level of revenue thank you denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah hi glenn denis here thank you very much for the question i think i understood it it was regarding compensation and also noncompensation expenses and as you noted for the full year we are able to take the compensation ratio down by over basis points while still being able to have a level of compensation and benefits that we thought was appropriate in light of the firms performance taking into context the competitive environment for talent and also wanted to ensure that we had our team in place ready to continue to serve our clients and continue to execute on our plan as we go forward to the extent that the environment in shifts that compensation model is highly variable and that is a lever that we can certainly pull to continue to deliver on our targets with respect to efficiency ratio as well as aggregate level of returns i think you separately pointed out that noncompensation expenses were up and those noncompensation expenses were up as we continue to make investments in the firm some of the largest drivers of our non compensation expense in the year were transactionrelated activity that is our largest noncompensation expense and to the extent that activity were to vary and be different we would expect those expenses to be different other drivers were professional fees and then also technology spend and these are technology spend in particular technology spend and engineering expense is a strategic expense for the firm thats one area where we expect to continue to invest but we similarly have a number of levers across our operating expenses that should the environment prove different in we would look to make adjustments to operator our next question is from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so david i was hoping you could speak to the tremendous growth that youre seeing in trading revenues this year its also consumed a fair amount of capital standardized rwas are up about yearonyear its clearly been the right call to lean into those trading opportunities just given the returns generated in global markets but if the industry activity contracts can you speak to how we should think about the interplay between revenues and allocated capital and whether we should expect some rwa relief as activity normalizes the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thanks steven ill start and there might be some stuff that denis adds but i think the most important thing and you highlighted it and we feel very good about it and i think its one of the reasons why we were able to deliver returns for the year is it was a client opportunity and an activity opportunity and we allocated to it resources including capital and therefore driving rwas in a different environment if this normalized we think we have the nimble ability to be reactive and adjust weve always been relatively nimble on our capital allocation in the business i think we made the right decision this year and captured a lot of upside and therefore a lot of book value growth but in an environment where the market opportunity and the client opportunity was different it would be reflected in changes in our balance sheet position and our rwas listening to the first two questions id just again highlight we look through everything this management team is looking through everything through the lens of the fact that we laid out a strategic plan two years ago to drive higher returns and invest in our businesses grow certain platforms and run the firm more efficiently when we had that investor day two years ago none of us could have anticipated the environment that weve lived through over the last two years and particularly the environment this year which was obviously a significant tailwind for our business i think weve done a very good job being nimble and capturing the opportunity that existed because of the increase in client activity but we in no way see that as a permanent environment thats going to continue at this pace we continue to be focused on doing exactly what we set out in the investor day to deliver higher more durable returns were going to update you on what we think that looks like but we remain very confident on what we set out at our investor day and think theres more that we can do and so obviously if some of the market activity that we saw in dissipated in we would change our capital allocation our rwas and our expense base accordingly operator our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc betsy we cant hear you manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi sorry this is manan gosalia on for betsy graseck i was wondering can you talk a little bit about the collaboration you recently announced with aws what functionality does that give you on your platform and do you think that that will drive more wallet share with existing clients bring in new clients or is it a combination of the two david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure and we continue to find more ways to migrate certain platforms to the cloud which gives us more efficiency and ability to connect with our clients and deliver resources to our clients this partnership with aws allows us to take our datasets inside goldman sachs and if you think about secdb with all the trading datasets and the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 information that we have inside in the old model clients come to us we use that data and we give them feedback so they can transact in the new model were allowing an ability for clients to connect directly into that so they can develop directly on that platform with our datasets which will allow them to think differently about their execution decisions and priorities there are different things that can happen from that one with certain very large clients weve gotten direct feedback from those clients that that can improve our wallet share because were delivering real value to them and secondarily we actually think there can be opportunities for people to pay for that as a service given the size of our dataset and the resources that we can deploy manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you and if i can ask an unrelated followup you had a very strong quarter and year on the ma advisory side i know you said that pipelines are still strong across investment banking and you have a very positive outlook on ma but can you talk about how you expect the environment to evolve as the fed starts to hike rates and as we get into the back half of the year and are there any differences in how you see sponsor activity playing out versus strategic activity david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think strategic activity is going to continue to be very high and one of the things i touched on in my opening comments we have a very very interesting macro environment because you have all these supply chain disruptions and i think those supply chain disruptions are real having a big effect on business and so people are looking for opportunities to strategically accelerate in a changing environment people are looking for further opportunities for scale theyre looking for further opportunities to consolidate and thats one of the reasons why the activity levels across our ma platform are quite active and so both from a backlog perspective and real time activity and just getting around with ceos broadly we think theres a good tailwind for continued ma activity and the uncertainty in the environment interestingly is actually helping that tailwind because its forcing people to look hard at ways they can strengthen their competitive position and so i think we have a big reset going on coming out of covid around supply chains the way businesses are positioned and i think thats going to create a significant amount of client activity now when you get back into the latter part of the year you talk about different economic environments its very hard to see that far out but at the moment the ma activity tailwind looks reasonably good operator your next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just a clarification you said next month well get an update will that be in the form of a brokerage firm conference or a special oneoff goldman sachs event carey halio a global headinvestor relations the goldman sachs group inc mike well put out a press release in the next couple weeks with the details mike the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay then to my questions i guess the first question is conceptually how do you think about taking the benefits of the higher level of revenues and reinvesting in the business certainly your efficiency ratio improved from to yearoveryear but in the fourth quarter it backed up quite a bit and more than expected and so trying to get a sense for how much youre willing to invest whether its employees technology complete that list at the expense of showing positive operating leverage david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well mike i appreciate the question and again i just want to take you back we laid out a plan and we set some targets and we are very confident of our ability to deliver on those targets and were going to provide more information based on what we know in the coming months as to how we think were going forward but were committed to that efficiency ratio target and i said this clearly in my remarks in any environment and so look this was certainly a very interesting year and i feel very good about the fact that there was an enormous opportunity given client activity for us to capture more of that activity make some investments around it and deliver really extraordinary returns and really extraordinary book value growth for our shareholders in a different environment im confident that there are a number of different levers that we can pull and in that different environment to continue to deliver on the targets we set and make the firm more durable and continue to grow our returns and so were focused on that were not wrapped up in the quarter were focused on our one two and threeyear version a vision of how we can continue to drive the firm forward and so i hope thats helpful but thats the way were thinking about it thats what were focused on and there were some extraordinary opportunity this year and we feel like we captured it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then the tougher question but youre in a better seat to forecast this how much longer should capital markets stay elevated versus prepandemic and this is a relevant question because youre allocating resources you said the backlog is close to the record level at the start of last year but i think the concern is really around the markets businesses and if you get more volatility maybe thats good on the other hand maybe the best days are behind us but with higher rates do you get a lot of money moving in and goldman sachs acts as an intermediary just how do you think about the ins and outs as it relates to the capital markets levels david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure and look i dont have a crystal ball mike and so there certainly could be volatility in activity levels but i think the important thing is to step back again and think about our franchise and i harken back to our investor day when we talked about our position in global markets and we said we wanted to grow our wallet share we wanted to increase the scalability of our client franchise we wanted to be more important to our clients weve materially grown our wallet share weve materially increased our position and there was definitely more client activity last year and this year and so we were able to capture that in a more normalized environment that opportunity might be different but we think we have the right resources to continue to be a leader and to capture what that puts forward and deliver reasonable returns against our overall package of returns as a firm i do think that market levels and activity levels given were in a very very unusual macro environment are going to continue to be reasonable as we start into this year im not going to predict what the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 things look like in the second half of the year or next year but youve still got a lot of volatility around the pandemic youve got big changes in supply chain youve got changes in interest rates theres a lot going on and so we still see clients being relatively active but what i feel best about is over the last two years weve been executing on our plan it strengthened our franchise its increased our wallet share were in a better position with our clients and weve also done a lot from an efficiency perspective in that business and so i feel very good about how that business has progressed since we laid out our plan at investor day in and i expect well continue to perform well as we move forward from here operator your next question comes from kian abouhossein with jpmorgan kian abouhossein q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah thanks for taking my question the first question is just coming back to the comp ratio if i exprovision on the comp ratio i actually get to versus actually flat yearonyear can you just confirm that and in context of comp if i just take a simple calculation of taking comp increase minus staff increase youre up around year onyear and if i compare that to peers looking at nine months or what has been reported so far its or less so just trying to understand your driver to pay more than what were going to see and what we expect to see from the street in terms of global peers on the comp side denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc okay thank you kian a couple comments i would make you referenced the ratio without taking account of the provisions and youre correct thats roughly flat at yearoveryear however we look at paying out compensation on the basis of revenues net of provisions these provisions are real and thats the basis on which we set our compensation ratio and is more than basis points lower than it was last year its also the lowest comp ratio in our history so we continue to drive that down drive efficiency on behalf of our clients you made some reference to changes in head count i mean something i would offer you up just by way of a perspective if you look at the roughly incremental heads that we have on head count on a yearoveryear basis approximately of those heads were located in strategic locations of the firm only of those heads in hub locations like new york london hong kong so theres a lot of things going on as we continue to evolve the complexion of our employee base and grow the firm and as a matter of efficiency and strategic priority in terms of sourcing talent and sort of redundancies around the world were very deliberately growing head count in different places and obviously as you can appreciate the expense associated with head count varies very much by location so that may help you with your numbers operator your next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions just curious about some of the different lines in the new businesses specifically the consumer and wealth segment and the corporate lending line how should we think about rate sensitivity in those lines can you give us any kind of parameters around how we would calibrate magnitude given were likely to see some rate increases here in the coming year the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thank you brennan its denis and look obviously recognize we have a different business than some of our large commercial bank peers but that being said given our expectation for the rate environment we see ourselves as remaining modestly assetsensitive we are focused on continuing to drive lending and increase our net interestearning assets so we would expect a benefit in that environment in that context i mean the other thing i would point out to you we mentioned in the script that with the first or i should say with the first basis point rate hike we would expect to be able to roll off the majority of our fee waivers on our money market funds and just for context that total number in was million brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that denis appreciate it also if i could just sneak in one more you guys gave some great color around the noncomp and clearly there was some noisy items in the fourth quarter but when we think about building out our outlook into based on what you can see now it seems like the environment is still solid youve talked about good backlogs and whatnot even though theyre down a little sequentially which is understandable is the backing out the charitable contribution and the litigation charge is that the right jumping off point as we think about or should we make further adjustments denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc look so i think as we think about noncompensation expense on the forward and taking all of it in totality and again all within the framework of our efficiency ratio our return targets et cetera where we sit today we dont see taking our operating expenses up materially from where they are right now there will be puts and takes within the portfolio of expenses and as is an item of consistent focus for the market and certainly for us one area that you should expect us to continue to invest in is across technology and engineering expense that number for us this past year was between billion and billion and thats a number that you should see us continue to invest in but across the balance of the portfolio well make adjustments based on the environment operator your next question is from devin ryan with jmp securities devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc thanks good morning david and denis thanks for taking the question i guess first question here just on the ma backdrop david i heard your comments loud and clear just around companies looking to kind of improve their strategic position and so when we think about i guess goldman sachs ma strategy your firm has been reasonably active over the past couple years here and we are seeing a little bit of a reset in valuation particularly in the fintech space so i know the price isnt the first consideration here but are there any areas that with more maybe attractive pricing or more reasonable valuations that makes sense to get into through ma versus organic ph build david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so devin i appreciate it and my message here is going to be relatively consistent we have these areas of the firm in particular asset management wealth management and the digital consumer banking platform the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 where we see real opportunity to expand and grow goldman sachs franchise real opportunity to ultimately diversify the earnings mix and make the firm more durable more diversified and drive higher returns i mean in that context if there are opportunities to accelerate that plan and add on to those businesses or accelerate the growth of those businesses well certainly consider them but we always consider them with discipline the lens through which wed ever think about doing something that was significant or transformative would be extremely high but you saw this year we had an opportunity in the asset management business through nn to really strengthen our position in europe open up some additional distribution channels and we think we made a very smart move in that so thats the lens that were looking at is are there ways to accelerate some of the growth and the diversification of the firm that are appropriate when you get to some of the growthy fintech stuff i think it gets more complicated what was interesting about greensky to us was the merchant network were thinking about how were going to build a merchant network and we thought it would take a very long time and this allowed us to acquire a merchant network at what we thought was a very attractive price very attractive merchant network and so we decided that that was an appropriate way to accelerate that strategy and so thats the lens that were going to look through as we continue to think about ways that we can execute on the strategy the way we laid out at investor day operator your next question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess just one question david around the consumer strategy so you mentioned about being opportunistic i guess as things come up but when we talk to investors it doesnt feel like the stock is getting the credit or the rerating as you diversify those earnings one like do you think the consumer business and the strategy needs a rethink or are you happy with the progress that youve made i guess would be the first part of the question david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so on the first part of the question were very happy with the progress were making but again and ive said this repeatedly this is something were building for the long term that we think could be a very very big business for the firm were building it with a lens that we set out return targets for the business and were making these investments knowing that were hugely committed to meet our return targets and move our return targets forward and this is going to take some time but we feel like the progress is good as we said on the call already today weve grown to million customers were expanding the product offering we have plans to continue to broaden what were doing and we feel very very good about it i dont think the strategy were very very clear on what were doing and how were doing it in the short term i dont expect to get a lot for us to get a lot of credit for it but were doing right thing for the long term for goldman sachs and our broad franchise and we feel very good about the progress that were making ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc noted and i guess just one followup denis and i apologize if this is making you repeat it but just on credit like do you worry about taking on a lot more credit risk given the loan growth outlook that you talked about as the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 were probably close to the peak of the cycle in terms of the health of the consumer just talk to about in terms of credit quality two three years out how do you think about it denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so thank you for the question were very focused on credit risk were very focused on risk management across all the risk stripes and while david has highlighted our strategic objectives to grow the firm drive more recurring durable revenues more financing and lending activities there is an attractiveness to the stability and predictability of that but all provided that you remain disciplined on credit and so that is something that we take into account as we think about the growth of our various businesses within the consumer business within the wholesale business and as we think about extension of credit across other segments of the firm i would point out for example that where we grow in the area of ficc financing were doing so with secured structures at reasonable ltvs as we deploy into the wealth segment these are highquality wealth management loans and so and as david just referenced in the consumer sector one of the things beyond the value of the merchants for greensky is the high fico characteristics of the customer base and so segmentby segment were making an effort to grow these types of revenues grow our balances but to do so in a credit sensitive fashion operator your next question is from dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning i wanted to follow up on the global markets business and how youre thinking about market share gains from here given the levels are a bit more a little more uncertain at this point and then also if you could clarify the fourth quarter sequential decline in the equities trading part given the market backdrop seemed to be more constructive than kind of your results david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so ill start broadly and denis may comment on fourth quarter equities but again ill take you back weve built our global markets business as a client franchise and thats been something weve been very very focused on over the last couple of years as you appropriately point out dan weve materially moved our position with many clients in a very very meaningful way i think theres still upside for us from a wallet and a share perspective looking at the broad client base but as we look at it going forward well take more sustainable share from what opportunity the market presents and thats the nature of that business and i think weve shown over a long period of time that were very very good at adapting and capturing the upside that exists in that business but we do it now from a stronger position of strength both in terms of the nature of our client franchise the relationships we have with our clients and also the efficiencies we have in that business and so were going to continue to focus on that and well see what environment is put forward as we move forward but my guess is that this business will continue to be a very large business and probably a more consistent business than the general narrative around the business when you go back and look at it over the course of the last years denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 sure and maybe just to add some context on the fourth quarter so looking at the fourth quarter versus third quarter of and also frankly versus fourth quarter of the comparison is such that the performance in the prior periods was really stronger and when we looked at the fourth quarter of we didnt have the exact same opportunities to deploy capital as we saw in the third quarter and some of the marketmaking for us was less attractive on a quarteroverquarter basis both versus the third quarter and fourth quarter in but again stepping back equities still did deliver its secondbest performance ever so from the state of the franchise the quality of the client dialogue the investments were making and the efficiencies of that business and our focus on growing the financing component of that that all feels very good to us david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah and also just the only other thing id highlight dan on that just to put in perspective and i know everybody wants to focus on the quarter and thats obviously appropriate but the markets business was up yearover year and when we started the year nobody believed that the markets business could be up from last year given the activity level last year and ph where last year sat so i think theres some structural things that have gone on that have improved the opportunity for all the participants in that business im not saying its going to level out at the level its been the last two years but i do think we sometimes got to step out of the quarter and think about whats going on in bigger bites of time especially in that business operator your next question is from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning theres obviously been a lot of focus on cost this quarter this year but is some of it just catchup from last year theres been a number of media reports that goldman sachs and other firms showed a lot of restraint last year and were looking to catch up a bit and i was just doublechecking my model i think your revenues were up over last year and comp was up only so is that part of the equation here that we should just better appreciate david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i think theres a component of that i mean id say theres a component where the where the component of that is most evident is that there is real wage inflation everywhere in the economy everywhere and if you talk to any ceo and most ceos obviously run different employee bases than we do but still at goldman sachs when you look at our people around the world the vast majority of those people fall into what you call a more traditional corporate compensation model and i think there definitely was coming out of last year after we went through the compensation process there were definitely places where i think with hindsight and with the constantlyevolving environment of covid and supply chain changes the monetary and fiscal policy environment what that did to savings rates et cetera where there was a real base pressure on what id call base kind of compensation and wage levels and so thats a component of it for sure theres also and i think its got to be put when people are looking at it especially in the fourth quarter when theyre looking at the comp numbers in the fourth quarter and people are doing their modeling we told everyone that we were going to try to do better at really estimating on a quartertoquarter basis where the compensation the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 levels needed to be and last year for example through three quarters our comp ratio was through three quarters and then we wound up going to for the year which made us i think dont hold me to this exactly approximately in the fourth quarter last year if we had been this year we obviously moved more aggressively through the year we were at through three quarters if we were at like we were last year the comp ratio in the fourth quarter would have been and then people would have seen that differently so again were thinking about the year were trying to do whats right for the year all through the lens of our strategy to deliver the appropriate sort of returns in any environment over time but i think the question is right matt that there was a component of a reset given the macro environment that i think is affecting business everywhere and i think weve done a good job kind of addressing that and taking care of that this year and so thats part of our base going forward operator your next question is from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you david you pointed out in your opening remarks about moving up to the top position with of your top clients twopart question one can you share with us or elaborate on what was the driver i mean where is the success is it coming from better execution is it coming from using your balance sheet better relationships and second will these reasons that drove you up to from be a real strength in a disruptive market where maybe we have markets down this year and not being up as you pointed out earlier david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so thanks for the question gerard and again this goes back to the one goldman sachs strategy and some things we laid out in a very clear fashion a couple years ago about the way we wanted to evolve the firm and while there have been parts of our organization particularly the investment banking franchise that have always been extremely clientcentric we didnt feel like in our markets business we were focused enough on the quality of those relationships we werent metricking and i know a lot of this is going to sound like very basic stuff we werent metricking and targeting it appropriately and theres a lot that we have learned as an organization over time that we thought could apply to the global markets business and really improve our position the move from to i think its or right now comes from the execution over the last two years of that strategy we are actively taking feedback and looking at metrics on our performance against these client base the feedback is very very strong from our clients that they see a change in the way were interacting with them and thats benefiting our wallet share i think theres still some upside in that moving if youre not top from with more than of them and now you go to youre top well for some of them youre number you could still be number or number and we think the base number of can be higher youre not going to get to be top with all but we think it can be higher than so we do think theres still some more upside in that if we continue to execute on a very clientcentric strategy if clients have a good experience with us if they feel like were taking their longterm interests at heart and every interaction and everything we do it improves our activity with them to the latter part of your question i do think in any environment we have a more sustainable franchise and we will benefit from that and so i think well continue to benefit from that investment but more work to do for sure the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 operator your next question is from jim mitchell with seaport global jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners hey good morning maybe a question on the acquisitions as we get closer to the closing of nnip and greensky are you feeling better worse about the strategic synergies and do you see these deals having any noticeable impact on earnings and returns in the intermediate term or these are longerterm projects thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc appreciate the question jim i mean we absolutely feel we feel just as good about them today as when we decided to do them i think what i can report is whenever you do something like this you start planning integration and we have integration teams on both deals and the work that were doing to prepare for integration as these deals come to close is going very well and in sync with what we expected in some places some upside to what we expected that said these are medium to longerterm acquisitions in the short term theres expense pressure and things that come through the pl which obviously were accounting for as we talk about our return targets but we feel very good about the medium and longerterm contribution that these will make just as i said earlier to strengthen and bolster and accelerate these franchises operator your next question is from jeremy sigee with bnp paribas exane jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas morning thank you you talked about headwinds to the capital ratio i just wondered if you could scope for us how big the main ones are what are the major items and how big they are and sort of linked to that how soon would you expect to move back up to a higher pace of share buybacks is that a reality or is that too soon will it take longer denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so a couple things i would mention to you as we think about capital ratio so obviously ending the year at what i was focused on in particular in terms of a discernible headwind is actually the announced but not yet closed acquisition of nnip we expect that to close in the beginning part of the second quarter and that would take sort of basis points off the ratio to address that and as it relates to sizing up our share buybacks i mentioned an expectation that for the first quarter wed be at or around the level of the fourth quarter and the reason for that is to ensure that we do have the capacity to support client activity and having referenced that our investment banking backlog is up significantly yearover year and given the outlook for markets where we have path towards rate normalization ongoing energy transition single stock volatility we see lots of opportunities we want to make sure were available to support our clients strategic objectives so hopefully thats helpful context for you jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 great thank you operator your next question is a followup from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi thanks for accommodating the followup just wanted to ask on the transaction banking business its not one that got much air play on this call but its admittedly tough to ignore the firmwide deposit growth of yearon year and certainly this business is contributing to that momentum i was hoping you could speak to the revenue contribution from the business today or in the most recent quarter and the success youre having specifically in attracting operational deposits from these clients denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc okay steve this is denis ill take that thank you for that question i mean obviously transaction banking one of the four initiatives that david highlighted and an opportunity from an addressable market perspective that is very very large and one where were seeing very good momentum so we focused obviously on our tech on the platform on the user interface thats now been wellvalidated by clients coming onboard the platform we have active clients in excess of this point in time the deposit growth as you noted over billion and ahead of target feeling very very good about that on the last quarters call we mentioned that operational and insured deposit as a percentage of core deposits had ticked up over thats now ticked up over so again as david indicated in terms of metrics and management and targets and the way in which we look to grow and build these strategic businesses were trying to provide these benchmarks which we hold ourselves accountable to to make progress time over time i guess on the revenue front weve also made very good progress so revenues for are up more than and now north of approximately million for the year so across each of the aspects of that build and that business and in light of what we see is a very very attractive addressable market that leverages our core competency with the corporates we feel good about the progress todate and on the forward operator at this time there are no further questions please continue with any closing remarks carey halio global headinvestor relations the goldman sachs group inc great so since there are no more questions wed just like to thank everyone for joining the call and if additional questions do arise please dont hesitate to reach out to me or others on the investor relations team and otherwise please stay healthy and we look forward to speaking with you soon operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes the goldman sachs fourth quarter
