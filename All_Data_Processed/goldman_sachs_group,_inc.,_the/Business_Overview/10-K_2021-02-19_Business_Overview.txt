of these key strategic locations and our goal is to increase this percentage to approximately by the end of we believe our investment in these strategic locations enables us to build centers of excellence around specific capabilities that support our business initiatives competition the financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive and we expect them to remain so our competitors are other entities that provide investment banking including transaction banking marketmaking investment management services commercial andor consumer lending deposittaking and other banking products and services as well as those entities that make investments in securities commodities derivatives real estate loans and other financial assets these entities include brokers and dealers investment banking firms commercial banks credit card issuers insurance companies investment advisers mutual funds hedge funds private equity funds merchant banks consumer finance companies and financial technology and other internetbased companies we compete with some entities globally and with others on a regional product or niche basis we compete based on a number of factors including transaction execution client experience products and services innovation reputation and price we have faced and expect to continue to face pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks in particular corporate clients seek such commitments such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments consolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets as a result we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions to capitalize on some of our most significant opportunities we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the us we also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services such as independent advisory firms some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are and as described below our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them a number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking marketmaking lending and asset management businesses for example the increasing volume of trades executed electronically through the internet and through alternative trading systems has increased the pressure on trading commissions in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than those for nonelectronic trading it appears that this trend toward lowcommission trading will continue price competition has also led to compression in the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it ie bidoffer spread which has affected our marketmaking businesses the increasing prevalence of passive investment strategies that typically have lower fees than other strategies we offer has affected the competitive and pricing dynamics for our asset management products and services in addition we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that may rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries we also compete on the basis of the types of financial products and client experiences that we and our competitors offer in some circumstances our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer or our competitors may develop technology platforms that provide a better client experience the provisions of the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act the requirements promulgated by the basel committee on banking supervision basel committee and other financial regulations could affect our competitive position to the extent that limitations on activities increased fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not apply or do not apply equally to all of our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions for example the provisions of the doddfrank act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between usbased and nonusbased banking organizations and give nonusbased banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the us and to form and invest in funds outside the us likewise the obligations with respect to derivative transactions under title vii of the doddfrank act depend in part on the location of the counterparties to the transaction the impact of regulatory developments on our competitive position has depended and will continue to depend to a large extent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve the extent of international convergence and the development of market practice and structures under the evolving regulatory regimes as described further in regulation below we also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees our ability to continue to compete effectively has depended and will continue to depend upon our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions our pay practices and those of certain of our competitors are subject to review by and the standards of the frb and other regulators inside and outside the us including the prudential regulation authority pra and the financial conduct authority fca in the uk we also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight see regulation compensation practices and risk factors competition our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees in part i item of this form 10k for further information about such regulation

have recently been and continue to be subject to significant changes the basel committee is the primary global standard setter for prudential bank regulation however its standards do not become effective in a jurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules to implement its standards the implications of these regulations for our businesses depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally and the market practices and structures that develop new regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers

encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management and iii the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance the guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated as appropriate into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions the guidance also notes that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness the doddfrank act requires the us financial regulators including the frb
