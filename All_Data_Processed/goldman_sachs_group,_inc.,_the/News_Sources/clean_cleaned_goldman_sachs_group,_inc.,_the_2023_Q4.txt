inside goldman when a big project fails the wall street firm was looking to get out of consumer lending once a big area of expansion but apple dumped it first at an offsite in upstate new york last month during a dinner lasting roughly three hours goldman sachs chief executive david solomon told partners that the firm had made some mistakes with consumer lending but he said the business wasnt as bad as they thought and they didnt understand the details he wouldnt tolerate partners trashtalking goldmans decision to get into consumer lending he told them goldman has known for a while that consumer lending wasnt really working out and the bank has been looking for the exits but it was apple that sealed it the tech giant recently sent a proposal to goldman that would pull the plug on their creditcard partnership the crown jewel of the business the split will effectively bring an end to goldmans oncegrand plan to be a bank for the masses an experiment it began about a decade ago as a way to build something different after the global financial crisis but the old and new never fit together engineering hires wooed from silicon valley grumbled about a stuffy culture executives in trading and investment banking goldmans traditional powerhouses groused about the moneylosing consumer endeavors in the fall of goldman was forging ahead with plans to expand the consumer business it was in the process of making a massive acquisition and was courting new creditcard partners solomon told deputies that if goldman was going to be in the consumer business it needed to go big still even solomon began to think the business was weighing goldman down according to people familiar with the matter shares were around at the time already near their record high but shareholders had expressed skepticism to goldman about its consumer plans solomon told colleagues he thought the stock could go much higher if goldman was to get an outside investor for the consumer business goldman began talking to a privateequity firm silver lake to see whether it could spin the consumer business into a joint venture according to people familiar with the matter it called the plan project maryland the m a reference to marcus the name for its consumer brand goldman codenamed itself georgia and silver lake was south carolina the talks fell apart after the two sides couldnt agree on how much control each would have over the new venture there were plenty of reasons for goldmans top brass to be on edge goldman had agreed in to buy greensky a lender that makes homeimprovement loans at a hefty price some executives had told solomon that it wouldnt be a good fit solomon had also been pushing for goldman to expand into checking accounts after top executives in the consumer business urged him not to saying the bank should stay focused on a small number of products solomon told them they had no vision according to people familiar with the matter the apple credit card went live in with great fanfare promising cash rewards the partnership had red flags from the outset goldman badly wanted to get that deal and that meant accepting a number of unusual terms from apple for example goldman agreed not to charge late fees or sell customer data trading away two massive streams of income when apple unveiled the credit card in it did so with a zinger designed by apple not a bank its ads chirped goldman partners complained that the firm was throwing good money after bad soon that wasnt the only issue in the federal reserve found problems with the banks consumer business it had concerns that goldman didnt have proper monitoring and control systems that same year goldman disclosed that the consumer financial protection bureau was investigating its creditcard practices including how the bank resolved billing disputes and refunded cardholders those probes continue employees in the consumer business were frustrated they had been asking since at least for the bank to invest more money in the operations that handle customer complaints according to people familiar with the matter some also blamed apple at least privately for the regulatory problems most card programs send out cardholders bills on a rolling basis throughout the month apple insisted that its cardholders get their bills at the beginning of each month that means goldman customerservice employees are flooded with complaints and requests during the first few days of every month making it hard for them to keep up adding to the tension investment banking fell off a cliff in both at goldman and at rivals hurt by rising interest rates and a big drop in stock prices goldmans usual power brokers became more incensed that the bank was spending money on a consumer business they didnt want later goldman would disclose that a big chunk of its consumerlending operations had lost billions of dollars the internal noise to kill the consumer experiment grew solomons no bank president john waldron ordered a review of the entire consumer operation at a managementcommittee meeting last fall marc nachmann one of the most senior partners at goldman blasted another goldman partner stephanie cohen about her business according to people familiar with the matter he told cohen who was coleading the consumer push that she wasnt making sense according to people who were present some committee members looked on uncomfortably cohen had been a star in goldmans investment bank and solomon had tapped her two years before to help run the consumer unit she inherited a troubled business at the managementcommittee meeting blowup she had just returned from a personal leave there were other instances where nachmann criticized cohens business people familiar with the matter said solomon at times spoke up in defense of the business while cohen was away solomon and his deputies decided to reorganize the entire bank including her domain the bank announced in october that cohen would be head of a new unit called platform solutions that unit would include greensky and the banks two creditcard partnerships the one with apple and another with general motors the deposits arguably the most enviable part of the consumer franchise would move to another new unit called asset and wealth management run by nachmann what goldman did made clear to the world it announced finally that it was scaling back its main street ambitions the waldronordered review had concluded that the consumer business couldnt produce the returns that goldman wanted within the near term according to people familiar with the matter by early this year goldman executives began looking for ways out of the apple partnership and even approached american express to gauge their interest still doubting they forged ahead anyway with new apple products a savings account launched in the spring as well as a buy now pay later service one worstcase internal projection the savings account would lose money for the next years after operating expenses were factored in now the consumer unit is quickly disappearing piece by piece the checking accounts never materialized the bank has stopped originating personal loans and sold off most of those balances it is unloading greensky at a steep loss in november it informed employees that it will move to unload its creditcard partnership with gm cohen went back on leave in june some employees who were once tasked with consumer lending have been moved to focus on fixing regulatory issues the bank for now is still responsible for the apple card and the gm card an arrangement that includes providing customer service goldman employees will also have to prepare for transferring balances to the company or companies that take over the cards a process that needs employees with experience at a meeting last month when the bank told employees it would be unloading the gm card it offered them a sweetener to stay many will be eligible for pay equal to one year of their compensation if their jobs are eliminated people familiar with the matter said the same will apply for employees who work on the apple card as for apple it wants out within the next roughly to months financial ceos are mum on china at hong kong panel hong kong when some of wall streets most powerful executives assembled in hong kong this week one topic was noticeable by its absence china the chief executives of us banks including citigroup goldman sachs and morgan stanley were in the city on tuesday for the global financial leaders investment summit where they rubbed shoulders with local government officials and senior chinese regulators they spoke about broad topics such as financial stability interest rates and capital markets but us bankers said almost nothing about mainland china and even less about the geopolitical tensions that have made their jobs harder the relationship between the us and china has worsened in recent years and wall street banks have come under political pressure to reduce their links to the worlds secondlargest economy the big discussion i think maybe not officially but obviously in private discussions is going to be the chineseus freeze and what does that really mean for growth prospects and general opportunities for these banks said mark williams a specialist in capital markets and risk management at boston university wall street banks are being forced to tread carefully on china they have for years considered the country an important growth market but the costs are rising chinas tighter control of information has made due diligence harder a backlash by american politicians has increased reputational risks and the shaky reopening of chinas economy has raised questions about its decadeslong growth story the amount of money banks can earn from chinese clients has also dwindled a sharp reduction in overseas listings from mainland chinese companies has reduced the fees available to investment banks most of the discussions steered clear of these questions morgan stanley chief executive james gorman and ubs group chairman colm kelleher joined a panel on financial stability goldman sachs ceo david solomon talked about the us banking system among other things citigroup ceo jane fraser took part in a discussion later in the day that largely focused on technology markets finance goldman infrastructure
