goldman sachs group inc the  banking finance wall street firms turn to blockchain goldman jpmorgan are processing some trades using the crypto technology wall streets biggest banks have largely avoided investing directly in cryptocurrencies but many are quietly working to integrate blockchain the technology behind crypto into trading and other businesses goldman sachs group inc is trading some bonds and other debt securities for clients on blockchainbased networks such as ethereum and the bank is building its own blockchainbased trading platform jpmorgan chase co has a platform in place called onyx big wall street firms help make the economy run connecting buyers and sellers of securities and lending money to businesses but their sophisticated trades are often run on creaky old systems goldman and others hope they will be able to run faster lesscostly and ultimately moreprofitable systems based on blockchains the blockchain sometimes called distributed ledger technology is the plumbing that keeps crypto markets running it is basically a software program that uses an open recordkeeping system a central ledger to track assets and record transactions and information about ownership of those assets every participant operates off the same central ledger blockchaindriven systems on wall street would be different in some respects from the systems behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies they would be permissioned networks meaning a central party such as a bank or a consortium of banks would decide who is allowed on outside of banking walmart inc used blockchain for tracking its supply chains in real estate some title companies used it for recording homeownership goldman and others say that using blockchain in trading platforms should lower the risk associated with trading partners backers say it could make it easier for issuers to track who owns their shares or other assets blockchain technology is going to rewire all financial services said tom farley the former president of the new york stock exchange that said wall street firms have been experimenting with blockchain projects for at least the past five years despite much hype few have had a widespread impact on how financial transactions take place others have thrown in the towel a group of european insurance companies formed a consortium called b3i in to explore blockchain uses in their industry in july the consortium shut down after failing to raise new capital regulatory issues could be a challenge especially for multinational banks dealing with a host of overseers rules about risk management custody and collateral are being developed in the us and overseas for instance the international basel committee on banking supervision is developing a set of regulations that could require banks to set aside capital against what it called unforeseen risks arising from blockchain networks challenges aside few banks want to run the risk of being left out of a potential new technology the biggest are engaged in an arms race to build competing platforms at goldman mathew mcdermott runs the digitalasset group which has about fulltime staffers specializing in areas such as engineering compliance and legal and government affairs mr mcdermott said he was a skeptic when he first heard of the blockchain but no more the same is true of many top wall street bankers who initially scoffed at the idea that bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies were more than a fad im not doing this just to satisfy my curiosity said mr mcdermott who has worked at goldman for years and led the group since everything has a commercial driver goldman declined to disclose financial information about the group including how much the bank has invested in it or whether it has turned a profit the firm expects the blockchainbased trading platform it is building to serve itself and its clients but also possibly be used by other banks as well some rivals are also planning for wider platforms jpmorgans onyx platform launched in can be used by other banks goldman bnp paribas and others have been using it to trade repos or repurchase agreements jpmorgan said onyx has processed more than billion of repo transactions theyre doing real trades said yuval rooz the chief executive of digital asset which writes blockchain software and counts goldman and the australian stock exchange among its clients still he said competition is tight last year goldman arranged a million twoyear bond issue for the european investment bank that was registered in france and handled on the ethereum network normally a bond sale like that would settle in five days mr mcdermott said it settled in just an hour what that means in practice is that money that might otherwise be tied up for days between counterparties will be freed up it means there is far less time to worry about counterparty risk the odds that one party or the other to a trade wont hold up its end of the transaction the bank has more clients for such digital bonds mr mcdermott said and expects to complete more sales banking finance goldman keeps chasing main st bank invests in checking accounts consumer offerings but has a way to go goldman sachs group inc first started taking deposits from ordinary savers more than six years ago it still has a way to go before it can call itself a fullservice consumer bank the bank has invested billions of dollars in marcus the consumer arm named after the firms founder its highyield savings accounts have amassed more than billion in deposits but its longdelayed checking account remains in beta testing its creditcard business has struggled to grow much beyond the splashy offering it launched with apple three years ago marcus offers installment loans for bigticket purchases but no auto loans or mortgages goldman the goto financier for the rich and powerful has a lot riding on its consumer project traditional investment banking and trading goldmans breadandbutter businesses are highly lucrative but can wilt in a market downturn a strong consumer business could provide a stable revenue base that in turn could win goldman a more generous stock valuation goldman shares are down so far this year slightly outperforming the sp but the business hasnt yet turned a profit and goldman isnt saying when it thinks it will still the bank expects the consumer business to top billion in annual revenue by roughly double what it is on pace to bring in this year to get there it must succeed in an unfamiliar role underdog and it needs to do it while staring down a possible recession that could damage household finances building a bank from scratch certainly takes investment and weve been making investment chief executive david solomon said on a conference call with analysts last week marcus opened in to make small personal loans of a few thousand dollars it also offered onlineonly savings accounts that customers could start with as little as those deposits helped goldman move away from more expensive wholesale credit facilities which lowered its borrowing costs even then executives made it clear that the bank wasnt in a hurry to scale up marcus we want to be very deliberate harit talwar who joined goldman in from discover financial services to run marcus said at an investor conference that fall progress has come in fits and starts goldman launched its credit card with apple in which brought the bank new customers a mobilebanking app came in as did a deal to buy the general motors co card business for about billion replacing capital one financial corp in early the bank lost one of marcuss key architects when omer ismail left goldman to join walmart incs nascent financialtechnology offering mr talwar left later that year the bank meanwhile was struggling to bulk up its creditcard business goldman in recent years has reached out to a number of us airlines to see if they were interested in card partnerships the wall street journal previously reported the bank was in talks with jetblue airways corp last year about taking over its creditcard program the journal reported but the airline opted to stay with barclays plc macys inc too rebuffed goldmans offer according to people familiar with the matter choosing to keep its partnership with citigroup inc the bank weighed launching a debit card with a rewards program last year in partnership with a smaller bank but decided against doing so because executives worried the project would invite regulatory scrutiny according to a person familiar with the matter federal law caps the interchange fees that many big banks can earn on debit transactions but smaller banks are exempt goldman ran into more hurdles when trying to launch the gm card technical glitches delayed the transfer of card balances from capital one to goldman according to people familiar with the matter structuring the cards rewards program also took longer than expected some of the people said the card went live in january several months past schedule a plan to offer checking accounts is also behind schedule at the banks investor day executives said they would come in but the bank turned its focus to other priorities goldman now expects to start offering checking accounts later this year the consumer bank now has about million customers more than billion in deposits and billion in credit card loans on its books marcus is now focused on launching its checking product and bringing greensky the specialty lender it bought earlier this year into the fold it is also searching for new partnerships card and otherwise there are lots of partnership opportunities and lots of people coming to us given our relationships our technology et cetera that are interested in doing things with us mr solomon told analysts last week the launch of checking is key to making marcus a viable option as a primary bank checking also would unlock new business opportunities for marcus by reaching its customers more often and selling them on other products like credit cards stephanie cohen goldmans global cohead of consumer and wealth management said in an interview the seeds needed to reach the billion revenue goal are already planted in the ground she said revenue at marcus grew in the second quarter from a year earlier to million goldman expects to have billion in card and consumer loan balances and billion in consumer deposits by up from billion and more than billion respectively at the end of june it is unclear when or if new business lines will be added after checking launches the bank hasnt announced plans to expand into biggerticket consumer products such as mortgage lending or auto finance other challenges loom goldmans contract with apple allows the tech giant to add another issuer before the deal expires according to a person familiar with the matter larger card issuers typically wouldnt agree to such an arrangement according to people who negotiate cobranded card deals apple recently announced a new buynow paylater offering goldman is involved in some of the products backend functions but apple will approve borrowers and fund the loans itself former goldman banker charged a former goldman sachs group
