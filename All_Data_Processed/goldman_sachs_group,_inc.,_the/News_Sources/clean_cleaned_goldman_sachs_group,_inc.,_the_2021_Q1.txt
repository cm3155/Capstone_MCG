jetblue cards investment bank looks to win contract away from barclays part of consumerfinance goal goldman sachs group inc is talking to jetblue airways corp about taking over its creditcard program according to people familiar with the matter the latest effort from the wall street firm to push deeper into consumer finance goldman is competing against barclays plc which is the current issuer of the jetblue credit cards and is in discussions to hold on to the deal the people said discussions are ongoing and jetblue may decide to stick with barclays jetblues contract with barclays doesnt end for another roughly three years some of the people said known for most of its history as an adviser to bluechip companies and elite money managers goldman entered the creditcard business in as part of a broader expansion into digitalbanking services for the masses its first credit card was launched in partnership with apple inc last year general motors co decided to move its creditcard offering from capital one financial corp to goldman as of december outstanding balances on goldmans credit cards totaled billion more than double their level the year before the bank expects to add about billion in gm creditcard balances when that deal closes in september that is still small compared with the big card issuers jpmorgan chase co had billion in creditcard balances as of the fourth quarter airline cobranded cards are among the most competitive in the creditcard industry while there are hundreds of retailers that banks could partner with to offer credit cards there are a limited number of us airlines the cards have historically appealed to banks because they attracted bigspending frequent travelers but creditcard spending particularly on airfare and other travel has been hit hard by the pandemic many people worried about taking on new debt in an uncertain job market switched to debit cards card issuers are betting that pentup demand will create a travel boom when the pandemic ends boosting demand for and usage of airline cards american express co and jpmorgan have long run the creditcard programs for delta air lines inc and united airlines holdings inc respectively citigroup inc and barclays both issue credit cards for american airlines group inc in the past several years goldman has reached out to many us airlines to see if they were interested in partnerships according to people familiar with the matter one challenge many of the major creditcard deals have five years or more left to them a jetblue deal could be risky for goldman because of the unusually long gap between when the deal would be signed and when it would take effect especially given the uncertainty around what will happen to travel demand in the intervening years barclays began issuing jetblue credit cards in after jetblue parted ways with amex goldman has courted jetblue for a few years according to one of the people familiar with the matter the bank recently started offering a loan option to consumers who book vacation packages through jetblue vacations allowing them to pay in installments late last year jetblue asked barclays to extend its contract years before it was set to expire in hopes that it would smooth the way to jetblue getting a loan from the treasury department people familiar with the matter said soon after jetblue put out a formal request for bids from other card issuers and entered into serious conversations with goldman the people said jetblue is also in discussions with barclays about extending its contract according to the people a jetblue spokeswoman said barclays has been an instrumental partner to our business and the success of our loyalty program she said jetblues request for bids will help us evaluate the right partner for us in this new travel landscape as we emerge from this crisis goldman started in consumer lending by mailing out unsolicited offers for unsecured personal loans but it scaled back those offers during the pandemic in addition to the new cobranded creditcard deals goldman spent last year inking deals with amazoncom inc and walmart inc to make loans to merchants that sell goods through those companies senior exits point to shift at goldman an unusually large number of senior executives have left goldman recently as ceo david solomon remakes the wall street firm a little more than two years into david m solomons tenure as chief executive of goldman sachs at least nine senior executives have left or intend to leave soon its an unusually large number for a firm long defined by its tightknit partnership culture since the beginning of the year four key executives have announced plans to leave according to internal emails and employees goldmans top lawyer one of its heads of asset management one of its few black female partners and the head of its consumer banking business other senior executives including one of the heads of investment banking announced plans to step down late last year all in all five members of the firms management committee its topmost governing body have left or given notice within the past five months roughly a sixth of the entire group the exodus is partly a reflection of the approach taken by mr solomon a 59yearold longtime investment banker who became chief executive late in he has sought to refashion goldman which went public more than two decades ago into a more traditional public company say current and former partners that has produced a more topdown hierarchical culture in which the institution is bigger than its people and goldmans oldfashioned partnership structure which imparts not only added pay and benefits but also a sense of family to the firms top players is less relevant these people say goldman plans to replace most of the people who are leaving and expects to do so easily said company officials the firm is well on its way to meeting the goals we set and investors seem to appreciate the changes the greater transparency and the clear direction weve put in place said jake siewert a goldman spokesman in a nod to its stock price which is trading at about an alltime high its an important part of goldman tradition for partners to leave for a wide range of new pursuits and we wish them well goldman mr siewert said has an extremely deep bench mr solomon stepped into his job about two and a half years ago when lloyd c blankfein who saw goldman through the financial crisis retired an avuncular harvardeducated former gold salesman mr blankfein was known for his sharp intellect and selfdeprecating quips how far down into the partnership do i have to go to find a partner who will listen to me he used to joke according to partners he sometimes likened his role to that of the senior partner at a law firm even though goldman hasnt been a true partnership since when it went public previous chief executives including mr blankfein were deferential to that aspect of the firms culture partners who were named every two years were feted at a blacktie dinner dance known internally as the prom once part of the group they often had spirited debates about promotions and firm strategy the partnership was once powerful enough that when highperforming employees were wooed by other companies their colleagues and bosses were often able to use their personal connections along with increased pay and promotional opportunities to reel them back mr solomon took a different approach he streamlined goldmans structure creating a new consumer wealth management unit to house its marcus retail banking division alongside its money management unit for rich individuals while focusing the traditional asset management business on investment funds he sought to trim costs potentially including payouts to partners who typically make millions of dollars in yearly pay and he pruned the 550member partnership to closer to under mr solomon the partner prom was downgraded to cocktails with a buffet dinner and no dancing mr solomon also has tried to diversify goldmans ranks to include more women and people of color he named women to the posts of treasurer and head of strategy and added two black executives to the management committee he also presided over a banner in which the firm churned out nearly billion in revenue a week its best results in years and reported its secondhighest profits ever in a brief note to investors on tuesday entitled gs poached again harvard of banks the banking analyst mike mayo wrote that goldman remained strong and that mr solomon has indicated that the partnership ranks were too top heavy and some churn should be expected when the pandemic started goldman like all other firms struggled to balance bringing employees back to the office where they could be more collaborative and better mentored and letting them work from home to avoid getting sick mr solomon who worked from the banks downtown manhattan headquarters all along had initially been flexible about letting goldman employees trade and advise clients remotely sheila patel the 51yearold chairwoman of the asset management division worked from her vacation home in new zealand ms patel was among those who eventually left retiring from the firm in december marco argenti the cochief information officer was in his home in seattle thousands of others worked from home in locations as varied as second homes and the master bathroom of their parents house but before long say current and former partners mr solomon began pressuring some managers especially partners to return to the office some partners bristled at the appearance of mr solomon questioning their productivity because they werent in the office others questioned his mandate that meetings of the management committee be held at goldman headquarters say current and former partners some believed that the meeting could just as easily be done from home especially because the committee members ended up spreading out over multiple conference rooms and conducting their affairs via video feeds to obey socialdistancing protocols late in march gregg lemkau the longtime cohead of investment banking and an executive who was widely considered a potential goldman ceo sent a twitter post about getting up during the wee hours to work remotely from his home in hawaii which is six hours behind new york he soon got a call from mr solomon who was not pleased with the perception of the message say three people with knowledge of the call the two executives argued those people said over whether mr lemkau should return to new york they settled their differences and mr lemkau stayed put for two months before flying back in midnovember mr lemkau then announced plans to retire from goldman to become chief executive of the family investment office of michael dell the billionaire founder of the computer company the reaction was overwhelming said mr lemkau in a podcast weeks later the memories colleagues shared he said underscored how his treatment of other people had defined him not the big deals i did not anything formal i did but the little things that you did that made a difference in their lives he reflected it sort of makes you feel like damn im glad it was worth doing all that stuff mr lemkau has told people privately that his departure had nothing to do with his tiff with mr solomon the exodus picked up steam this year last month michael daffey who had led the global markets division retired then this week eric s lane cohead of the firms assetmanagement business and also viewed as a contender for the goldman ceo role took a senior role at a large hedge fund karen patton seymour the firms general counsel since also left and plans to return to her former law firm according to internal emails all were members of the management committee and all but ms seymour had long tenures at the firm around the same time omer ismail head of goldmans marcus consumer business left to run a new financialtechnology venture that has been seeded by walmart taking a deputy who had overseen the firms apple credit card partnership along with him stephanie smith a consumer wealth management partner and one of just five black female partners at the firm has also exited to take an executive role at blackrock say three people with knowledge of her talks blackrock the giant asset manager had tried and failed to recruit her about five years earlier two of the people said ram sundaram a senior trading executive known for structuring complex bond deals left this year as did jason mathews who ran a us stockproduct sales desk and was one of roughly half a dozen black male partners for many the moment was bittersweet in an email mr mathews said he was extremely proud to be able to call gs home for
