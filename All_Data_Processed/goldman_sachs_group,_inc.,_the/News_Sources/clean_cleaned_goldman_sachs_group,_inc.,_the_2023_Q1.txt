goldmans stock price almost immediately goldman put greenskys healthcarefinance unit up for sale according to people familiar with the matter goldman executives were concerned about the reputational risk of being involved with a business that finances cosmetic surgeries some of the people said the loans which accounted for a small share of greenskys volume in attracted less creditworthy borrowers the people said goldman pulled the offering following lackluster interest in october goldman announced a sweeping reorganization that largely dismantled the consumer business the bank mr solomon told analysts had tried to do too much too fast greensky is now part of goldmans platform solutions business which also houses its apple card partnership the bank recently disclosed that the unit has lost billions of dollars since buy now pay later model is facing a crisis last tuesday was a rough day for goldman sachs the share price fell percent after the wall street giant reported its worst earnings miss in a decade on a call that morning analysts peppered david solomon the banks ceo with questions about its consumer banking strategy and about one unit in particular greensky goldman closed its billion acquisition of greensky a pioneer in the buy now pay later bnpl lending sector in march calling it a key piece in its strategy to build the consumer banking platform of the future it flew under the radar until last quarter the first in which goldman broke out earnings for its platform solutions business unit which includes greensky the picture wasnt pretty revenues were up but the division lost billion in goldmans troubles with greensky are indicative of a cloud hanging over the sector bnpl was one of the fastestgrowing areas in financial technology for years spawning europes most valuable startup klarna and promising to revolutionize how we consume and how banks could reach techsavvy new market segments the growth should continue according to worldpay bnpl accounted for percent of north american ecommerce transactions in and is projected to grow to percent by but what once seemed like attractive economics have been upended bnpl providers rely on loans for the money that they lend to customers for free and with rising interest rates those loans have become more expensive passing higher costs onto customers may be difficult those who like the idea of paying for a jacket or a dishwasher in installments may not be willing to pay extra for the privilege the industry is now facing an existential crisis as profits remain elusive valuations plummet competition increases and regulators ask tough questions about the lending practices behind bnpl in goldmans case greensky targets customers with high credit scores who are paying for home improvement projects rather than smallticket items a spokesperson said goldman says its committed to greensky but as it disclosed last week the losses are piling up it hopes bnpl will draw in new customers but so far its not driving profits that so many banks and tech firms are hunting these days consumer banking foray turns costly for goldman goldman sachs will take a big hit from its illfated move into consumer banking even as its other businesses weaken amid an economic slowdown goldman sachs is paying for its misbegotten foray into consumer banking six years ago wall streets most elite investment bank made a big pitch to the little guy rolling out credit cards highinterest accounts and loans on friday the bank announced that it had lost slightly more than billion tied to that business since december its the latest in a mounting pile of woes for goldman which is contending with an economic slowdown that has hurt its traditional investment banking business at the same time that the changes instituted by david m solomon who took over as chief executive in have caused upheaval inside the bank the announcement on friday followed a major restructuring that mr solomon unveiled in october as part of his efforts to streamline the banks culture and practices and to better orient the firm toward a future in which technology is likely to sap the ability of big banks to make money as intermediaries the reorganization involved combining one part of its consumer banking business including its online bank marcus with an asset and wealth management unit a second part of the consumer business including a credit card partnership with apple was folded into a newly created unit its breadandbutter investment banking and trading businesses were merged into a third unit goldmans retail banking operation has been foundering for some time but its hardly the only challenge facing the bank for the past few years goldman has dealt with uneven earnings and departures of top executives some of whom were frustrated with mr solomons leadership style this week it let go of bankers its largest round of layoffs since the aftermath of the financial crisis tony fratto a spokesman for goldman sachs characterized the job cuts as a mix of slimming down in the face of slowing corporate deal making a retrenchment in the firms consumer ambitions and the ordinary culling of lowperforming staff the fortunes of many wall street banks have swung widely in recent years big us banks benefited from an easing of restrictions during the trump administration and in the early part of the coronavirus pandemic volatile markets which help trading and government bailouts and easy monetary policy which encouraged consumer spending and corporate activity enabled many to turn record profits the frenzy which included record dealmaking activity in and came to a halt last year largely as a result of the federal reserves interest rate increases jpmorgan chase the nations largest bank by assets reported a betterthanexpected fourthquarter profit on friday but said investment banking revenue plunged percent as big companies went into retrenchment mode the combination of high interest rates and fast inflation has hit goldman especially hard because of the slowdown in its most profitable businesses in sales and trading goldmans revenue last quarter shrank roughly twice as fast as that of its peers according to estimates from credit suisse and the business of advising companies on initial public offerings and mergers tapered off strangling a big source of revenue for the bank though goldman maintained its place among peers as the leader in advising companies in the global revenue it brought in from deals fell to billion from billion in a record year for dealmaking according to dealogic its equity capital markets business felt a far bigger sting bringing in million in the united states last year much less than the billion it brought in a year earlier on friday goldman revised its
