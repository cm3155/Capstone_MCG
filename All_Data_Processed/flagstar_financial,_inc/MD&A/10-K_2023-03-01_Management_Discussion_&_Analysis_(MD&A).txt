york community bancorp inc and our consolidated subsidiaries including flagstar bank na the bank executive summary for the twelve months ended december net income was million an increase of million or percent compared to the million the company reported for the twelve months ended december net income available to common stockholders for the twelve months ended december was million also up million and percent compared to the twelve months ended december on a per share basis this translates into diluted earnings per share of in fullyear up percent compared to the we reported in fullyear in terms of profitability our fullyear results reflect a return on average assets of percent compared to percent in fullyear and a return on average common stockholders equity of percent for the fullyear versus percent for the fullyear loan portfolio at december total loans and leases held for investment were billion up billion or percent compared to billion at december of the billion in growth this year the flagstar acquisition contributed billion in loans net of paa during the year multifamily loans increased billion or percent to billion while the cre portfolio increased billion or percent to billion the increase in the cre portfolio was due to the flagstar acquisition while the increase in multifamily loans was primarily the result of organic growth our specialty finance portfolio increased million or percent to billion at december total commitments for the specialty finance portfolio stood at billion at december the remaining ci portfolio excluding specialty finance totaled billion at yearend compared to million at yearend due primarily to the flagstar acquisition onetofour family residential loans held for investment totaled billion at december the vast majority of these loans were acquired in the flagstar acquisition other loans totaled billion at december compared to only million at yearend the increase was due to the flagstar acquisition and is mostly comprised of consumer loans loans held for sale were billion at december resulting from the flagstar acquisition these loans consisted of onetofour family residential mortgage loans pending sale for which we have elected the fair value option at december multifamily loans represented percent of total loans compared to percent at december commercial loans including specialty finance and cre loans represented percent compared to less than percent at december while residential loans represented percent deposit base total deposits at december were billion up billion or percent compared to billion at december deposit growth was driven by the addition of billion of deposits from the flagstar acquisition and billion growth in loanrelated deposits and baas deposits noninterestbearing deposits were billion at december and represented percent of total deposits compared to billion or percent as of december excluding the impact of the flagstar acquisition deposits increased billion or percent during loanrelated deposits totaled billion at december up million or percent as compared to billion at december in addition our baas deposits totaled billion at december up billion compared to billion at december our baas deposits fall into three verticals traditional baas banking as a service for government agencies and states which includes the us treasurys prepaid debit card program and mortgage as a service which caters to mortgage companies and consists primarily of escrow deposit accounts for principal interest and tax payments the majority of the yearoveryear growth was in the government banking as a service vertical and related to certain prepaid debit card programs net interest income during the twelve months ended december our net interest income grew driven by our higher asset base net interest income for fullyear was billion up million or percent compared to billion for the twelve months ended december average interestearning assets increased billion or percent over the course of the year to billion primarily due to organic loan growth and the flagstar acquisition the average yield increased basis points to percent average interestbearing liabilities totaled billion up billion or percent while the average cost of funds rose basis points to percent for the twelve months ended december the nim declined basis points to percent compared to percent for the twelve months ended december primarily driven by the impact of higher interest rates on the liability sensitive balance sheet through november with the flagstar acquisition we remain slightly liability sensitive see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk prepayment income contributed eight basis points to the fullyear nim compared to basis points during fullyear as prepayments slowed due to rising interest rates asset quality asset quality remained strong during as increases in npas were substantially due to changes in asset mix related to the flagstar acquisition and centered on nonperforming onetofour family residential and home equity loans total npas at december were million compared to million at december primarily driven by npls and assets acquired in the flagstar acquisition at december npas to total assets equaled percent and npls to total loans were percent compared to percent for both metrics at december results of operations as compared to net interest income net interest income is our primary source of income its level is a function of the average balance of our interestearning assets the average balance of our interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interestearning assets and our interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by various external factors including the local economy competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the fomc and market interest rates the cost of our deposits and borrowed funds is largely based on shortterm rates of interest the level of which is partially impacted by the actions of the fomc the fomc reduces maintains or increases the target federal funds rate the rate at which banks borrow funds overnight from one another as it deems necessary while the target federal funds rate generally impacts the cost of our shortterm borrowings and deposits the yields on our heldforinvestment loans and other interestearning assets are not as sensitive to intermediateterm market interest rates another factor that impacts the yields on our interestearning assetsand our net interest incomeis the income generated by our multifamily and cre loans and securities when they prepay since prepayment income is recorded as interest income an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields as applicable on our loans securities and interestearning assets and therefore in our net interest income our net interest rate spread and our net interest margin it should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions including real estate values and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates in addition while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and therefore prepayment income so too may an increase in market interest rates it is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect or see that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate for the twelve months ended december net interest income totaled billion up million or percent compared to the twelve months ended december the yearoveryear improvement was driven by an increase in interest income partially offset by higher interest expense due to the rising rate environment yearoveryear comparison the following factors contributed to the yearoveryear increase in net interest income interest income on mortgage and other loans net totaled billion up million compared to fullyear interest income also increased across all other categories with securities up million and income on money market investments up million compared to last year interest income on mortgages and other loans net was driven by a billion or percent increase in average loan balances to billion this is due to organic loan growth throughout the year and the december acquisition of flagstar additionally we had a basis point increase in the average loan yield to percent from percent in due primarily to the rising interest rate environment interest income on securities was positively impacted by a bps increase in the average yield to percent from percent along with a million or percent increase in the average securities balance to billion interestearning cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by a bps increase in the average yield to percent driven by higher short term market rates while balances remained flat interest expense on average interestbearing deposits increased million to million during fullyear driven by a basis point increase in the average cost of interestbearing deposits due to rising interest rates and competition for deposits additionally our average deposits grew billion or percent to billion the balance growth reflects the december acquisition of flagstar as well as growth in the companys loanrelated deposits and baas deposits loanrelated deposits totaled billion at december up million or percent from to billion at december our baas deposits totaled billion at december as compared to billion at december interest expense on borrowed funds increased million or percent to million driven by a basis point increase in rates partially offset by a million or percent decline in in the average balance to billion partially due to our shift to lower cost deposits net interest margin the companys net interest margin declined basis points for the twelve months ended december to percent compared to percent for the twelve months ended december this decline was driven by our liability sensitive balance sheet in the rising rate environment prepayment income contributed eight basis points to the fullyear net interest margin compared to basis points during fullyear the following table sets forth certain information regarding our average balance sheet for the years indicated including the average yields on our interestearning assets and the average costs of our interestbearing liabilities average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interestearning assets average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interestbearing liabilities

of compared to can be found in the companys previously filed annual report on we did not have any potential problem loans at december that would have caused management to have serious doubts as to the

onetofour family first mortgage loans acquisition development and construction loans other loans total loans table end each of the preceding allocations was based upon an estimate of various factors as discussed in critical accounting estimates and a different allocation methodology may be deemed to be more appropriate in the future in addition it should be noted that the portion of the allowance for losses on loans allocated to each loan category does not represent the total amount available to absorb losses that may occur within that category since the total loan loss allowance is available for the entire loan portfolio securities total securities were billion or percent of total assets at december compared to billion or percent of total assets at december at december and december all of our securities were designated as availableforsale at december percent of our portfolio are floating rate securities at december availableforsale securities had an estimated weighted average life of

weighted average life of years mortgagerelated securities accounted for billion of the yearend balance with other debt securities accounting for the remaining billion the investment policies of the company and the bank are established by the board of directors and implemented by the alco alco meets monthly or on an asneeded basis to review the portfolios and specific capital market transactions in addition the securities portfolios and investment activities are reviewed monthly by the board of directors furthermore the policy governing the investment portfolio activities is reviewed at least annually by the alco and ratified by the board of directors our general investment strategy is to purchase liquid investments with various maturities to ensure that our overall interest rate risk position stays within the required limits of our investment policies we generally limit our investments to gse obligations and us treasury obligations at december and gse obligations and us treasury obligations together represented percent and percent of total securities respectively the remainder of the portfolio at those dates was comprised of assetbacked securities corporate bonds foreign notes capital trust notes and municipal obligations the following table summarizes the weighted average yields of debt securities for the maturities indicated at december table start mortgage related

bank stock at december the company had million and million of fhlbny stock at cost and fhlbindianapolis stock at cost respectively at december the company had million of fhlbny stock at cost the company maintains an investment in fhlbny stock and as a result of the flagstar acquisition fhlbindianapolis stock partly in conjunction with its membership in the fhlb and partly related to its access to the fhlb funding it utilizes in addition at december the company had million of federal reserve bank stock at cost the company had no federal reserve bank stock at december bankowned life insurance boli is recorded at the total cash surrender value of the policies in the consolidated statements of condition and the income generated by the increase in the cash surrender value of the

acquired in the flagstar acquisition our investment in boli rose million yearoveryear to billion at december goodwill we record goodwill in our consolidated statements of condition in connection with certain of our business combinations goodwill which is tested at least annually for impairment refers to the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of an acquired companys assets net of the liabilities assumed for more information about the companys goodwill see the discussion of summary of significant accounting policies in the footnote of these consolidated statements sources of funds the parent company has four primary funding sources for the payment of dividends share repurchases and other corporate uses dividends paid to the parent company by the bank capital raised through the issuance of securities funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments and repayments of and income from investment securities on a consolidated basis our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources retail institutional and brokered deposits borrowed funds primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities in loan repayments and sales generated cash flows of billion as compared to billion in in cash flows from the repayment of securities totaled million while the purchase of securities amounted to billion for the year by comparison cash flows from the repayment of securities totaled billion in and were offset by the purchase of securities totaling billion in the cash flows from loans and securities were primarily deployed into the production of multifamily loans held for investment as well as heldforinvestment cre loans and specialty finance loans and leases deposits our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors including customer satisfaction the rates of interest we pay the types of products we offer and the attractiveness of their terms from time to time we have chosen not to compete actively for deposits depending on our access to deposits through acquisitions the availability of lowercost funding sources the impact of competition on pricing and the need to fund our loan demand the vast majority of our deposits are retail in nature ie they are deposits we have gathered through our branches or through business combinations total deposits increased billion or percent on a yearoveryear basis to billion deposit growth was driven by the addition of billion of deposits from the flagstar acquisition and billion growth in loanrelated deposits and baas deposits loanrelated deposits totaled billion at december up million or percent relative to billion at december our baas deposits totaled billion at december as compared to billion at december in addition the company has institutional deposits and municipal deposits institutional deposits remained unchanged from the prior year end at billion municipal deposits represented million of total deposits at the end of this december a million decrease from the balance at december depending on their availability and pricing relative to other funding sources we also include brokered deposits in our deposit mix brokered deposits accounted for billion of our deposits at the end of this december compared to billion at december brokered money market accounts represented billion of total brokered deposits at december and billion at december brokered interestbearing checking accounts represented billion and billion respectively at the corresponding dates at december we had billion of brokered cds compared to billion at december the following table indicates the amount of time deposits by account that are in excess of the fdic insurance limit currently by time remaining until maturity table start december in millions portion of us time deposits in excess of insurance limit time deposits otherwise uninsured with a maturity of months or less over months through months over months through months over months total time deposits otherwise uninsured table end our uninsured deposits on an unconsolidated basis are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the fdic insurance limit currently and were approximately billion and billion at december and respectively these amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes borrowed funds the majority of our borrowed funds are wholesale borrowings fhlbny and fhlbindianapolis advances and to a lesser extent junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes at december total borrowed funds increased billion or percent to billion compared to the balance at december the yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by the amounts assumed in the flagstar acquisition of billion wholesale borrowings wholesale borrowings totaled billion and billion respectively at december and representing percent of total assets at both dates fhlbny and fhlbindianapolis advances accounted for billion of the yearend balance as compared to billion at the prior yearend pursuant to blanket collateral agreements with the bank our fhlbny fhlbindianapolis advances and overnight advances are secured by pledges of certain eligible collateral in the form of loans and securities for more information regarding our fhlb advances see the discussion that appears earlier in this report regarding our membership and our ownership of stock in the fhlbny at december and billion and billion of our wholesale borrowings had callable features respectively included in wholesale borrowings at december was million of repurchase agreements there were no repurchase agreements outstanding at december repurchase agreements are contracts for the sale of securities owned or borrowed by the bank with an agreement to repurchase those securities at agreedupon prices and dates our repurchase agreements were primarily collateralized by gse obligations and may be entered into with the fhlbny or certain brokerage firms the brokerage firms we utilize are subject to an ongoing internal financial review to ensure that we borrow funds only from those dealers whose financial strength will minimize the risk of loss due to default in addition a master repurchase agreement must be executed and on file for each of the brokerage firms we use we had no federal funds purchased at both december and junior subordinated debentures junior subordinated debentures totaled million including million assumed from the flagstar acquisition net of purchase accounting adjustments at december subordinated notes at december the balance of subordinated notes was million including million assumed from the flagstar acquisition net of purchase accounting adjustments see note borrowed funds in item financial statements and supplementary data for a further discussion of our wholesale borrowings our junior subordinated debentures and subordinated debt liquidity contractual obligations and offbalance sheet commitments and capital position liquidity we manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand we monitor our liquidity daily to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents which totaled billion and billion respectively at december and as in the past our loan and securities portfolios provided meaningful liquidity in with cash flows from the repayment and sale of loans totaling billion and cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities totaling million additional liquidity stems from deposits and from our use of wholesale funding sources including brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings in addition we have access to the banks approved lines of credit with various counterparties including the fhlbny the availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the amount of mortgage loan collateral available under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and to a lesser extent the amount of available securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings at december our available borrowing capacity with the fhlbny was billion in addition the bank had availableforsale securities of billion of which billion is unpledged furthermore the bank has agreements with the frbny that enable it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing their liquidity in connection with these agreements the bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds they may borrow the maximum amount the bank could borrow from the frbny was billion there were no borrowings against these lines of credit at december our primary investing activity is loan production and the volume of loans we originated for investment totaled billion in during this time the net cash used in investing activities totaled billion the net cash provided by our operating activities totaled billion our financing activities provided net cash of billion cds due to mature or reprice in one year or less from december totaled billion representing percent of total cds at that date our ability to attract and retain retail deposits including cds depends on numerous factors including among others the convenience of our branches and our other banking channels our customers satisfaction with the service they receive the rates of interest we offer the types of products we feature and the attractiveness of their terms our decision to compete for deposits also depends on numerous factors including among others our access to deposits through acquisitions the availability of lowercost funding sources the impact of competition on pricing and the need to fund our loan demand the parent company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity in addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases the parent company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our stockholders as a delaware corporation the parent company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or in case there is no surplus from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year the parent company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity in addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases the parent company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to the companys shareholders as a delaware corporation the parent company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or in case there is no surplus from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year various legal restrictions limit the extent to which the companys subsidiary bank can supply funds to the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries the bank would require the approval of the occ if the dividends it declares in any calendar year were to exceed the total of its respective net profits for that year combined with its respective retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years less any required transfer to paidin capital the term net profits is defined as net income for a given period less any dividends paid during that period as a result of our acquisition of flagstar we are also required to seek regulatory approval from the occ for the payment of any dividend to the parent company through at least the period ending november in dividends of million were paid by the bank to the parent company at december the bank could have paid additional dividends of million to the parent company without regulatory approval contractual obligations and offbalance sheet commitments in the normal course of business we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities fund loan growth operate our branch network and address our capital needs for example we offer cds with contractual terms to our customers and borrow funds under contract from the fhlbny and various brokerage firms these contractual obligations are reflected in the consolidated statements of condition under deposits and borrowed funds respectively at december we had cds of billion and longterm debt defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity one year or more of billion we also are obligated under certain noncancelable operating leases on the buildings and land we use in operating our branch network and in performing our backoffice responsibilities these obligations are included in the consolidated statements of condition and totaled million at december at december we also had commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations as well as commercial performance standby and financial standby letters of credit totaling billion these offbalance sheet commitments consist of agreements to extend credit as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee the letters of credit we issue consist of performance standby financial standby and commercial letters of credit financial standby letters of credit primarily are issued for the benefit of other financial institutions municipalities or landlords on behalf of certain of our current borrowers and obligate us to guarantee payment of a specified financial obligation performance standby letters of credit are primarily issued for the benefit of local municipalities on behalf of certain of our borrowers performance letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under nonfinancial contractual obligations commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions the majority are used to settle payments in international trade typically such letters of credit require the presentation of documents that describe the commercial transaction and provide evidence of shipment and the transfer of title the fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in fee income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income based upon our current liquidity position we expect that our funding will be sufficient to fulfill these cash obligations and commitments when they are due both in the short term and long term for the year ended december we did not engage in any offbalance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows at december we had no commitments to purchase securities capital position as reflected in the following

capital total riskbased capital leverage capital table end at december the capital ratios for the company and the bank continued to exceed the levels required for classification as well capitalized institutions as defined under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of and as further discussed in note capital in item financial statements and supplementary data impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with gaap which requires that we measure our financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations as a result the impact of interest rates on our performance is greater than the impact of general levels of inflation interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services impact of recent accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting standards in march the fasb issued asu no financial instruments credit losses topic troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures the amendments in this asu eliminate tdr accounting for entities that have adopted asu no while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan modifications when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty the asu also requires disclosure of current period gross writeoffs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated statements of condition results of operations or

common stockholders equity total assets and book value per common share are financial measures that are recorded in accordance with us gaap tangible common stockholders equity tangible assets and tangible book value per common share are not it is managements belief that these nongaap measures should be disclosed in this report and others we issue for the following reasons tangible common stockholders equity is an important indication of the companys ability to grow organically and through business combinations as well as its ability to pay dividends and to engage in various capital management strategies tangible book value per common share and the ratio of tangible common stockholders equity to tangible assets are among the capital measures considered by current and prospective
