item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary at june total assets were billion up billion compared to december total deposits were billion at june up billion from december these yeartodate increases were primarily due to our march assumption of a substantial amount of the deposits and certain identified liabilities and the acquisition of certain assets and lines of business of signature bridge bank from the fdic as receiver for signature bridge bank the signature transaction see note business combinations to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the signature transaction for the three months ended june net income was million as compared to billion for the three months ended march net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended june was million compared to billion for the three months ended march diluted eps totaled for the three months ended june compared to for the three months ended march second quarter and first quarter net income and diluted eps were impacted by a bargain purchase gain of million and billion respectively arising from the purchase and assumption of certain assets and liabilities in the signature transaction also included in net income for the three months ended june and march were merger related and restructuring expenses of million and million respectively related to both the signature transaction and the flagstar acquisition in addition first quarter results were impacted by an initial provision for credit losses totaling million for the loans acquired in the signature transaction loan portfolio at june total ci loans were billion compared to billion at december the majority of the increase is attributable to the billion of ci loans acquired in the signature transaction along with growth in the mortgage warehouse portfolio on a linked quarter basis mortgage warehouse loans rose million or percent due to using our market position in this vertical to capitalize on several competitors exiting the market the multifamily loan portfolio was billion at june down slightly compared to billion at december the slight decline during this period was due to a combination of higher interest rates and our increasing ability to diversify our loan portfolio as a result of our recent acquisition at june multifamily loans represented percent of total loans compared to percent at december further demonstrating the reduction of our concentration in this asset class commercial loans commercial real estate and acquisition development and construction increased billion at june to billion compared to billion at december largely attributable to the signature transaction onetofour family residential loans totaled billion at june representing seven percent of total loans compared to billion or eight percent of total loans at december other loans totaled billion at june compared to billion at december the other loan portfolio consists mostly of consumer loans loans heldforsale at june totaled billion up from billion at december deposit base deposits at june totaled billion up billion compared to billion at december driven primarily by an increase to billion of custodial deposits related to the signature transaction our deposit base includes billion of uninsured deposits at june a net increase of billion as compared to december due to the signature transaction this represents percent of our total deposits these amounts were determined based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes and exclude internal accounts we also have billion of total ready liquidity cash and cash equivalents unpledged securities fed funds access and fhlb borrowing capacity our total ready liquidity approximately matches the balance of our uninsured deposits net interest income for the three months ended june net interest income totaled million up million or percent compared to the three months ended march the current quarters results include a fullquarters contribution from the signature transaction compared to only a partial month signature contribution in the first quarter of this year for the three months ended june the nim was percent up basis points compared to the three months ended march the linkedquarter improvement was due to the signature transaction which drove higher levels of average interestearnings assets specifically loans held for investment and average cash and cash equivalent balances including custodial deposits related to the signature transaction in addition we continued to benefit from the higher interest rate environment which positively impacted the yields on our assets partially offset by a higher cost of funds and higher average interestbearing liabilities average interestearning assets increased billion or percent to billion while the average yield rose basis points to percent average interestbearing liabilities grew billion or percent to billion while the average cost of funds increased basis points to percent asset quality our asset quality metrics remained strong during the second quarter of despite increases in npls and npas attributable to certain loans acquired in the signature transaction and flagstar acquisition at june npas to total assets equaled percent compared to percent at march while npls to total loans equaled percent compared to percent at december repossessed assets of million were relatively unchanged compared to the million recorded in the prior quarter recent events declaration of dividend on common shares on july the companys board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share on the companys common stock the dividend is payable on august to common stockholders of record as of august results of operations net interest income net interest income is our primary source of income its level is a function of the average balance of our interestearning assets the average balance of our interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interestearning assets and our interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by various external factors including the local economy competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the fomc and market interest rates the cost of our deposits and borrowed funds is largely based on shortterm rates of interest the level of which is partially impacted by the actions of the fomc while the target federal funds rate generally impacts the cost of our shortterm borrowings and deposits the yields on our heldforinvestment loans and other interestearning assets are not as sensitive to intermediateterm market interest rates another factor that impacts the yields on our interestearning assetsand our net interest incomeis the income generated by our multifamily and cre loans and securities when they prepay since prepayment income is recorded as interest income an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields as applicable on our loans securities and interestearning assets and therefore in our net interest income our net interest rate spread and our net interest margin it should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions including real estate values and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates this impact is most prevalent in our multifamily portfolio in addition while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and therefore prepayment income so too may an increase in market interest rates it is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect or see that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate the impact of prepayments on the current quarter was minimal comparison to prior quarter net interest income for the three months ended june was million up million or percent compared to the three months ended march this quarters results include a fullquarters contribution from the signature transaction compared to only a partial month contribution in the first quarter of this year which is the primary cause of most of the linkedquarter differences explained below interest income on mortgage and other loans net totaled billion up million compared to first quarter of this year this increase was driven by a billion or percent increase in average loan balances to billion this is primarily due to the full quarter activity related to the signature transaction additionally we had a basis points increase in the average loan yield to percent from percent in the prior quarter due primarily to the rising interest rate environment interest income on securities was positively impacted by a basis points increase in the average yield to percent from percent along with a billion or percent decrease in the average securities balance to billion interest income on cash and cash equivalents increased million driven by a seven basis points increase in the average yield to percent driven by higher shortterm market rates coupled with an increase in the average balance of billion driven by the signature transaction interest expense on average interestbearing deposits increased million to million during the three months ended june driven by a basis point increase in the average cost of interestbearing deposits due to rising interest rates and competition for deposits additionally our average interest earning deposits grew billion or percent to billion the balance growth reflects the december acquisition of flagstar and the march signature transaction interest expense on borrowed funds decreased million or percent to million driven by a nine basis point decrease in rates in addition to a billion or

along with a billion or percent increase in the average securities balance to billion primarily driven by the six month contribution from the flagstar acquisition interestearning cash and cash

loans we produce are primarily secured by nonluxury residential apartment buildings in new york city that feature rentregulated units and belowmarket rents the multifamily loan portfolio was billion at june down slightly compared to billion at december due to a combination of higher interest rates and our loan diversification strategy the majority of our multifamily loans were secured by rental apartment buildings at june billion or percent of the companys total multifamily loan portfolio is secured by properties in new york state and therefore are subject to the new rent regulation laws the weighted average ltv of the new york state rent regulated multifamily portfolio was percent as of june unchanged from december in addition to underwriting multifamily loans on the basis of the buildings income and condition we consider the borrowers credit history profitability and building management expertise borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the buildings current rent rolls their financial statements and related documents while a percentage of our multifamily loans are tenyear fixed rate credits the vast majority of our multifamily loans feature a term of ten or twelve years with a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten or eight through twelve the rate charged in the first five or seven years is generally based on intermediateterm interest rates plus a spread during the remaining years the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is indexed to cme term sofr plus a spread alternately the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the fiveyear fixed advance rate of the fhlbny plus a spread the fixedrate option also requires the payment of one percentage point of the thenoutstanding loan balance in either case the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial fiveor sevenyear term as the rent roll increases the typical property owner seeks to refinance the mortgage and generally does so before the loan reprices in year six or eight multifamily loans that refinance within the first five or seven years are typically subject to an established prepayment penalty schedule depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the thencurrent loan balance if a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixedrate option the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve for example a tenyear multifamily loan that prepays in year three would generally be expected to pay a prepayment penalty equal to three percentage points of the remaining principal balance a twelveyear multifamily loan that prepays in year one or two would generally be expected to pay a penalty equal to five percentage points because prepayment penalties assessed to the borrower are recorded as interest income they are reflected in the average yields on our loans and interestearning assets our net interest rate spread and net interest margin and the level of net interest income we record no assumptions are involved in the recognition of prepayment income as such income is recorded when the cash is received our success as a multifamily lender partly reflects the solid relationships we have developed with the markets leading mortgage brokers who are familiar with our lending practices our underwriting standards and our longstanding practice of basing our loans on the cash flows produced by the properties the process of producing such loans is generally four to six weeks in duration and because the multifamily market is largely brokerdriven the expense incurred in sourcing such loans is substantially reduced we believe our underwriting quality of multifamily lending is distinctive this reflects the nature of the buildings securing our loans our underwriting process and standards and the generally conservative ltv ratios our multifamily loans feature at origination historically a relatively small percentage of the multifamily loans that have transitioned to nonperforming status have resulted in actual losses even when the credit cycle has taken a downward turn we primarily underwrite our multifamily loans based on the current cash flows produced by the collateral property with a reliance on the income approach to appraising the properties rather than the sales approach we also consider a variety of other factors including the physical condition of the underlying property the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service the dscr which is the ratio of the propertys net operating income to its debt service and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value ie the ltv of the property in addition to requiring a minimum dscr of percent on multifamily buildings we obtain a security interest in the personal property located on the premises and an assignment of rents and leases our multifamily loans generally represent no more than percent of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property and typically feature an amortization period of years in addition our multifamily loans may contain an initial interestonly period which typically does not exceed two years however these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis accordingly while our multifamily lending niche has not been immune to downturns in the credit cycle the limited number of losses we have recorded even in adverse credit cycles suggests that the multifamily loans we produce involve less credit risk than certain other types of loans in general buildings that are subject to rent regulation have tended to be stable with occupancy levels remaining more or less constant over time because the rents are typically below market and the buildings securing our loans are generally maintained in good condition they have been more likely to retain their tenants in adverse economic times in addition we exclude any shortterm property tax exemptions and abatement benefits the property owners receive when we underwrite our multifamily loans the following table presents a geographical analysis of the multifamily loans in our

analysis table included below for additional details approximately billion of the cre portfolio are office properties with an average balance of approximately million and located primarily in the new york metro area there are no nonperforming loans or recent chargeoffs with respect to this portfolio as of june the terms of more than half of our cre loans are similar to the terms of our multifamily credits which primarily feature a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the loan that is generally based on intermediateterm interest rates plus a spread in addition to customary fixed rate terms we now also offer floating rates advances indexed to cme term sofr these products are generally offered in combination with interest rate cap or swaps that provide borrowers with additional optionality to manage their interest rate risk following the initial fixed rate period the loan resets to an adjustable interest rate that is indexed to cme term sofr plus a spread alternately the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the fiveyear fixed advance rate of the fhlbny plus a spread the fixedrate option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the thenoutstanding loan balance in either case the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five or sevenyear term prepayment penalties apply to certain of our cre loans as they do our multifamily credits depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the thencurrent loan balance if a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixed rate option the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties to minimize our credit risk we originate cre loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the propertys current income stream and dscr the approval of a loan also depends on the borrowers credit history profitability and expertise in property management and generally requires a minimum dscr of percent and a maximum ltv of percent in addition the origination of cre loans typically requires a security interest in the fixtures equipment and other personal property of the borrower andor an assignment of the rents andor leases in addition our cre loans may contain an interestonly period which typically does not exceed three years however these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis the following table

florida texas pennsylvania ohio all other states total acquisition development and construction loans at june our adc loans represented billion or percent of total loans held for investment reflecting an increase of million compared to december because adc loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk especially during a downturn in the credit cycle borrowers are required to provide a guarantee of repayment and completion the risk of loss on an adc loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial appraisal of the propertys value upon completion of construction the developers experience the estimated cost of construction including interest and the estimated time to complete andor sell or lease such property when applicable as a condition to closing an adc

loans that are partly guaranteed by the small business administration a broad range of ci loans both collateralized and unsecured are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and accounts receivable business expansion the purchase of machinery and equipment and other general corporate needs in determining the term and structure of ci loans several factors are considered including the purpose the collateral and the anticipated sources of repayment ci loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower and include financial covenants to monitor the borrowers financial stability also included in our ci portfolio is our national warehouse lending platform with relationship managers across the country we offer warehouse lines of credit to other mortgage lenders which allow the lender to fund the closing of residential mortgage loans each extension advance or drawdown on the line is fully collateralized by residential mortgage loans and is paid off when the lender sells the loan to an outside investor or in some instances to the bank underlying mortgage loans are predominantly originated using the agencies underwriting standards the guideline for debt to tangible net worth is to we have billion outstanding warehouse loans to other mortgage lenders and have relationships in place to lend up to billion at our discretion the interest rates on our ci loans can be fixed or floating with floatingrate loans being tied to sofr prime or some other market index plus an applicable spread our floatingrate loans may or may not feature a floor rate of interest the decision to require a floor on ci loans depends on the level of competition we face for such loans from other institutions the direction of market

construction nm commercial and industrial nm other loans total loans days past due a loan generally is classified as a nonaccrual loan when it is days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because we no longer expect to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status we cease the accrual of interest owed and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income at june and december all of our nonperforming loans were nonaccrual loans a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is current and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible we monitor nonaccrual loans both within and beyond our primary lending area in the same manner monitoring loans generally involves inspecting and reappraising the collateral properties holding discussions with the principals and managing agents of the borrowing entities and retain legal counsel as applicable requesting financial operating and rent roll information confirming that hazard insurance is in place or forceplacing such insurance monitoring tax payment status advancing funds as needed and seeking approval from the courts to appoint a receiver when necessary to protect the banks interests including to collect rents manage property operations and ensure maintenance of the collateral properties it is our policy to order updated appraisals for all nonperforming loans days or more past due irrespective of loan type that are collateralized by multifamily buildings cre properties or land if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old appraisals are ordered annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status it is not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans however appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount a modification in loan terms or an extension of a maturing loan the following table presents our nonperforming loans by loan type and the changes in the respective balances change from december to june

june total nonaccrual mortgage loans increased million to million while other nonaccrual loans increased million to million compared december included in the june amount were nonaccrual loans of million acquired in the signature transaction at june npas to total assets equaled percent compared to percent at march while npls to total loans equaled percent compared to percent at december repossessed assets of million were relatively unchanged compared to the million recorded in the prior quarter nonperforming loans are reviewed regularly by management and discussed on a monthly basis with the board credit committee and the board of directors of the bank as applicable in accordance with our chargeoff policy collateraldependent nonperforming loans are written down to their current appraised values less certain transaction costs workout specialists from our loan workout unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment in addition outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to such borrowers properties and other assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition less the estimated cost of selling the property subsequent declines in the fair value of the assets are charged to earnings and are included in noninterest expense it is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment of properties classified as oreo before foreclosure and to reappraise the properties on an asneeded basis and not less than annually until they are sold we dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible given current market conditions and the propertys condition to mitigate the potential for credit losses we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent in the case of multifamily and cre loans we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated by the property to determine its economic value using the income approach and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan the amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values with the economic value more typically used the condition of the collateral property is another critical factor multifamily buildings and cre properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to approval furthermore independent appraisers whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced inhouse appraisal officers and staff perform appraisals on collateral properties in addition we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers is typically greater than ten years furthermore in new york city where the majority of the buildings securing our multifamily loans are located the rents that tenants may be charged on certain apartments are typically restricted under certain rentcontrol or rentstabilization laws as a result the rents that tenants pay for such apartments are generally lower than current market rents buildings with a preponderance of such rentregulated apartments are less likely to experience vacancies in times of economic adversity reflecting the strength of the underlying collateral for these loans and the collateral structure a relatively small percentage of our nonperforming multifamily loans have resulted in losses over time to further manage our credit risk our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower and typically require minimum dscrs of percent for multifamily loans and percent for cre loans although we typically lend up to percent of the appraised value on multifamily buildings and up to percent on commercial properties the average ltvs of such credits at origination were below those amounts at june exceptions to these ltv limitations are minimal and are reviewed on a casebycase basis the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties to minimize our credit risk we originate cre loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the propertys current income stream and dscr the approval of a cre loan also depends on the borrowers credit history profitability and expertise in property management given that our cre loans are underwritten in accordance with underwriting standards that are similar to those applicable to our multifamily credits the percentage of our nonperforming cre loans that have resulted in losses has been comparatively small over time multifamily and cre loans are generally originated at conservative ltvs and dscrs as previously stated low ltvs provide a greater likelihood of full recovery and reduce the possibility of incurring a severe loss on a credit in many cases they reduce the likelihood of the borrower walking away from the property although borrowers may default on loan payments they have a greater incentive to protect their equity in the collateral property and to return their loans to performing status with regard to adc loans we typically lend up to percent of the estimated ascompleted market value of multifamily and residential tract projects however in the case of home construction loans to individuals the limit is percent with respect to commercial construction loans we typically lend up to percent of the estimated ascompleted market value of the property credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers andor consulting engineers to minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing each of our credits is secured with a perfected first security interest or outright ownership in the underlying collateral and structured as senior debt or as a noncancellable lease to further minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing we reunderwrite each transaction in addition we retain outside counsel to conduct a further review of the underlying documentation other ci loans generally represent loans to commercial businesses which meet certain desired client characteristics and credit standards the credit standards for commercial borrowers are based on numerous criteria including historical and projected financial information strength of management acceptable collateral and market conditions and trends in the borrowers industry these loans are generally variable rate loans in which the interest rate fluctuates with a specified index rate the procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories with late charges assessed and notices mailed to the borrower at specified dates we attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment when contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property we attempt to obtain full payment and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action delinquencies are addressed by our loan workout unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings fair values for all multifamily buildings cre properties and land are determined based on the appraised value if an appraisal is more than one year old and the loan is classified as either nonperforming or as an accruing tdm then an updated appraisal is required to determine fair value estimated disposition costs are deducted from the fair value of the property to determine estimated net realizable value in the instance of an outdated appraisal on an impaired loan we adjust the original appraisal by using a thirdparty index value to determine the extent of impairment until an updated appraisal is received while we strive to originate loans that will perform fully adverse economic and market conditions among other factors can negatively impact a borrowers ability to repay historically our level of net chargeoffs in our multifamily and specialty finance portfolios have been relatively low in downward credit cycles even when the volume of nonperforming loans has increased for the six months ended june our net recoveries were million as c ompared to net recoveries of million over the same period in the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases increased million equaling million at june from million at december the increase was primarily related to the initial allowance for credit losses of million for the acquired loans in the signature transaction an increase of million in specific reserves primarily related to two loans that have moved to nonaccrual and an increase of million primarily related to our worsening forecast of macroeconomic conditions and origination volume since yearend the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases represented percent of nonperforming loans at june as compared to percent at the prior yearend based upon all relevant and available information at june management believes that the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases represents a reasonable estimate based upon our judgment as that date the

parent company has four primary funding sources for the payment of dividends share repurchases and other corporate uses dividends paid to the parent company by the bank capital raised through the issuance of securities funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments and repayments of and income from investment securities on a consolidated basis our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources retail institutional and brokered deposits borrowed funds primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities deposits our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors including customer satisfaction the rates of interest we pay the types of products we offer and the attractiveness of their terms from time to time we have chosen not to compete actively for deposits depending on our access to deposits through acquisitions the availability of lowercost funding sources the impact of competition on pricing and the need to fund our loan demand the vast majority of our deposits are retail in nature ie they are deposits we have gathered through our branches or through business combinations depending on their availability and pricing relative to other funding sources we also include brokered deposits in our deposit mix brokered deposits accounted for billion of our deposits at june compared to billion at december brokered money market accounts represented billion of total brokered deposits at june and billion at december brokered interestbearing checking accounts represented billion and billion respectively at june we had billion of brokered cds compared to billion at december our uninsured deposits are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the fdic insurance limit currently these amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes and excludes internal accounts at june our deposit base includes billion of uninsured deposits a net increase of billion as compared to december due to the signature transaction this represents percent of our total deposits we also have billion of total ready liquidity cash and cash equivalents unpledged securities fed funds access and fhlb borrowing capacity our total ready

position liquidity we manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand we monitor our liquidity daily to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents which totaled billion and billion at june and december respectively the billion increase in cash and cash equivalents includes custodial deposits related to the signature transaction our billion of total ready liquidity cash and cash equivalents unpledged securities and fhlb borrowing capacity approximately matching the balance of our uninsured deposits additional liquidity stems from deposits and from our use of wholesale funding sources including wholesale borrowings and brokered deposits in addition we have access to the banks approved lines of credit with various counterparties including the fhlbny the availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the amount of mortgage loan collateral available under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and to a lesser extent the amount of available securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings at june our available borrowing capacity with the fhlbny was billion i n addition the bank had availableforsale securities of billion of which billion is unpledged furthermore the bank has agreements with the frbny that enable it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing our liquidity in connecti on with these agreements the bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds we may borrow the maximum amount the bank could borrow from the frbny was billion there were no borrowings against these lines of credit at june cds due to mature or reprice in one year or less from june totaled billion representing percent of total cds at that date our ability to attract and retain retail deposits including cds depends on numerous factors including among others the convenience of our branches and our other banking channels our customers satisfaction with the service they receive the rates of interest we offer the types of products we feature and the attractiveness of their terms our decision to compete for deposits also depends on numerous factors including among others our access to deposits through acquisitions the availability of lowercost funding sources the impact of competition on pricing and the need to fund our loan demand the parent company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity at june the parent company held cash and cash equivalents of million in addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases the parent company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our stockholders as a delaware corporation the parent company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or in case there is no surplus from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year various legal restrictions limit the extent to which the companys subsidiary bank can supply funds to the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries the bank would require the approval of the occ if the dividends it declares in any calendar year were to exceed the total of its respective net profits for that year combined with its respective retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years less any required transfer to paidin capital the term net profits is defined as net income for a given period less any dividends paid during that period as a result of our acquisition of flagstar we are also required to seek regulatory approval from the occ for the payment of any dividend to the parent company through at least the period ending november in connection with receiving regulatory approval from the occ for the signature transaction the bank has committed that i for a period of two years from the date of the signature transaction it will not declare or pay any dividend without receiving a prior written determination of no supervisory objection from the occ and ii it will not declare or pay dividends on the amount of retained earnings that represents any net bargain purchase gain that is subject to a conditional period that may be imposed by the occ in the six months ended june dividends of million were paid by the bank to the parent company at june the bank had million available for additional dividends excluding bargain purchase gain from retained earnings at june we believe the company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next months and for the foreseeable future contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities fund loan growth operate our branch network and address our capital needs for example we offer cds with contractual terms to our customers and borrow funds under contract from the fhlbny these contractual obligations are reflected in the consolidated statements of condition under deposits and borrowed funds respectively at june we had cds of billion and longterm debt defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity one year or more of billion we also are obligated under certain noncancelable operating leases on the buildings and land we use in operating our branch network and in performing our backoffice responsibilities these obligations are included in the consolidated statements of condition and totaled million at june an increase of million compared to million at december driven by the signature transaction at june we also had commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations as well as commercial performance standby and financial standby letters of credit these commitments consist of agreements to extend credit as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee the following table summarizes the companys commitments to originate loans and letters of credit in millions june december multifamily and commercial real estate onetofour family including interest rate locks acquisition development and construction warehouse loan commitments other loan commitments total loan commitments commercial performance standby and financial standby letters of credit total commitments the letters of credit we issue consist of performance standby financial standby and commercial letters of credit financial standby letters of credit primarily are issued for the benefit of other financial institutions municipalities or landlords on behalf of certain of our current borrowers and obligate us to guarantee payment of a specified financial obligation performance standby letters of credit are primarily issued for the benefit of local municipalities on behalf of certain of our borrowers performance letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under nonfinancial contractual obligations commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions the majority are used to settle payments in international trade typically such letters of credit require the presentation of documents that describe the commercial transaction and provide evidence of shipment and the transfer of title the fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in fee income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income based upon our current liquidity position and ready liquidity of billion we expect that our funding will be sufficient to fulfill these cash obligations and commitments when they are due both in the short term and long term for the three months ended june we did not engage in any offbalance sheet transactions that we expect to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows at june we had no commitments to purchase securities regulatory capital the bank is subject to regulation examination and supervision by the occ and the federal reserve the regulators the bank is also governed by numerous federal and state laws and regulations including the fdic improvement act of which established five categories of capital adequacy ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized such classifications are used by the fdic to determine various matters including prompt corrective action and each institutions fdic deposit insurance premium assessments capital amounts and classifications are also subject to the regulators qualitative judgments about the components of capital and risk weightings among other factors the quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of leverage capital to average assets and of common equity tier capital tier capital and total capital to riskweighted assets as such measures are defined in the regulations at june our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company

per common share tangible book value per common share market risk as a financial institution we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility which represents our primary market risk changes in market interest rates represent the greatest challenge to our financial performance as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and on the market value of all interestearning assets other than those possessing a short term to maturity to reduce our exposure to changing rates the board of directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate the actual duration of heldforinvestment mortgage loans and mortgagerelated securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates the level of prepayments may in turn be impacted by a variety of factors including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated seasonal factors demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages however the factors with the most significant impact on prepayments are market interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities we managed our interest rate risk by taking the following actions we have continued to emphasize the origination and retention of intermediateterm assets primarily in the form of multifamily and cre loans we have continued the origination of certain ci loans that feature floating interest rates increased the focus on retaining low costs deposits and obtained new low cost deposits as part of the bankingasaservice initiative the use of derivatives to manage our interest rate position uninsured deposits we manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand as a result we have billion of total ready liquidity cash and

total deposits libor transition process and phase out the company has certain loans interest rate swap agreements investment securities and debt obligations whose interest rate is indexed to libor in the fca which is responsible for regulating libor announced that the publication of libor is not guaranteed beyond in december the administrator of libor announced its intention to i cease the publication of the oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor after december and ii cease the publication of all other tenors of us dollar libor one three six and 12month libor after june and on march announced that it will permanently cease to publish most libor settings beginning on january and cease to publish the overnight onemonth threemonth sixmonth and 12month us dollar libor settings on july accordingly the fca has stated that it does not intend to persuade or compel banks to submit to libor after such respective dates until such time however fca panel banks have agreed to continue to support libor in october the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a joint statement on managing the libor transition that offered their regulatory expectations and outlined potential supervisory and enforcement consequences for banks that fail to adequately plan for and implement the transition away from libor the failure to properly transition away from libor may result in increased supervisory scrutiny the implementation of a substitute index for the calculation of interest rates under the companys loan agreements may result in disputes or litigation with counterparties over the appropriateness or comparability to libor of the substitute index which would have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations even when robust fallback language is included there can be no assurances that the replacement rate plus any spread adjustment will be economically equivalent to libor which could result in a lower interest rate being paid to the company on such assets the alternative reference rates committee a group of privatemarket participants convened by the frb and the frbny has identified sofr as the recommended alternative to libor the use of sofr as a substitute for libor is voluntary and may not be suitable for all market participants sofr is calculated and observed differently than libor given the manner in which sofr is calculated it is likely to be lower than libor and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions market practices related to sofr calculation conventions continue to develop and may vary inconsistent calculation conventions among financial products may expose is to increased basic rate and resultant costs other alternatives to libor also exist but because of the difference in how those alternatives are constructed they may diverge significantly from libor in a range of situations and market conditions the bank established a subcommittee of alco to address issues related to the phase out and transition from libor this subcommittee consists of personnel from various departments through the bank including lending loan administration credit risk management financetreasury including interest rate risk and liquidity management information technology and operations the company has liborbased contracts that extend beyond june the subcommittee has monitored the banks libor transition progress and substantially all contracts have been updated in complying with industry requirements the bank has not offered new liborbased products since december interest rate sensitivity analysis interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity eve over a range of interest rate scenarios eve is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet contracts the eve ratio under any interest rate scenario is defined as the eve in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario the model assumes estimated loan and mbs prepayment rates current market value spreads and deposit decay rates and betas based on the information and assumptions in effect at june the following table sets forth our eve assuming the changes in interest rates noted change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in economic value of equity over one year over one year over one year over one year the net changes in eve presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank accordingly while the eve analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and may very well differ from actual results interest rate risk is also monitored through the use of a model that generates net interest income nii simulations over a range of interest rate scenarios modeling changes in nii requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates in this regard the nii analysis presented below assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities furthermore the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table due to the frequency timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories and prepayments among other factors coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes based on the information and assumptions in effect at june the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months assuming the changes in interest rates noted change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in future net interest income over one year over one year over one year over one year in general short and longterm rates are assumed to increase in parallel instantaneously and then remain unchanged the net changes in nii presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our eve andor nii simulations in the event that our eve and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits we would undertake the following actions to ensure that appropriate remedial measures were put in place in formulating appropriate strategies the alco committee would ascertain the primary causes of the variance from policy tolerances the expected term of such conditions and the projected effect on capital and earnings our alco committee would inform the board of directors of the variance and present recommendations to the board regarding proposed courses of action to restore conditions to withinpolicy tolerances where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing other balance sheet management activities including the potential use of derivatives to reduce the risk exposure where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques other strategies might include asset restructuring involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect

savings bank in ohio and amtrust bank in arizona and florida basis of presentation the following is a description of the significant accounting and reporting policies that the company and its subsidiaries follow in preparing and presenting their consolidated financial statements which conform to us generally accepted accounting principles and to general practices within the banking industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period estimates that are used in connection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses mortgage servicing rights the flagstar acquisition and the signature transaction the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and other entities in which the company has a controlling financial interest all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation the company currently has certain unconsolidated subsidiaries in the form of whollyowned statutory business trusts which were formed to issue guaranteed capital securities see note borrowed funds for additional information regarding these trusts loans effective january the corporation adopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu no financial instruments credit losses topic troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures asu which eliminated the accounting for troubled debt restructurings tdrs while expanding loan modification and vintage disclosure requirements under asu the corporation assesses all loan modifications to determine whether one is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty regardless of whether the modified loan terms include a concession modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form of an interest rate reduction an otherthaninsignificant payment delay a term extension principal forgiveness or a combination thereof collectively referred to as troubled debt modifications or tdms notes to the consolidated financial statements prior to the adoption of asu the company accounted for certain loan modifications and restructurings as tdrs in general a modification or restructuring of a loan constituted a tdr if the company granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty adoption of new accounting standards standard description effective date asu financial instruments credit losses topic troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures issued march asu eliminates prior accounting guidance for tdrs while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty the standard also requires that an entity disclose currentperiod gross chargeoffs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases the company adopted asu effective january using a modified retrospective transition approach for the amendments related to the recognition and measurement of tdrs the impact of the adoption resulted in an immaterial change to the allowance for credit losses acl thus no adjustment to retained earnings was recorded disclosures have been updated to reflect information on loan modifications given to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as presented in note tdr disclosures are presented for comparative periods only and are not required to be updated in current periods additionally the current year vintage disclosure included in note has been updated to reflect gross chargeoffs by year of origination for the three months ended june asu investments equity method and joint ventures topic accounting for investments in tax credit structures using the proportional amortization method issued march permits reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met the company adopted asu effective january and is not expected to have a significant impact on the companys consolidated financial statements note computation of earnings per common share earnings per common share basic and diluted basic eps is computed by dividing the net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted eps is computed using the same method as basic eps however the computation reflects the potential dilution that would occur if outstanding inthemoney stock options were exercised and converted into common stock unvested stockbased compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends paid on the companys common stock are considered participating securities and therefore are included in the twoclass method for calculating eps under the twoclass method all earnings distributed and undistributed are allocated to common shares and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends on the common stock the company grants restricted stock to certain employees under its stockbased compensation plan recipients receive cash dividends during the vesting periods of these awards including on the unvested portion of such awards since these dividends are nonforfeitable the unvested awards are considered participating securities and therefore have earnings allocated to them the following table presents the companys computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share three months ended june six months ended june in millions except share and per share amounts net income available to common stockholders less dividends paid on and earnings allocated to participating securities earnings applicable to common stock weighted average common shares outstanding basic earnings per common share earnings applicable to common stock weighted average common shares outstanding potential dilutive common shares total shares for diluted earnings per common share computation diluted earnings per common share and common share equivalents note business combinations signature bridge bank on march the companys wholly owned bank subsidiary flagstar bank na the bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement the agreement with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as receiver the fdic receiver of signature bridge bank na signature to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of signature the signature transaction headquartered in new york new york signature bank was a fullservice commercial bank that operated branches in new york seven branches in california two branches in north carolina one branch in connecticut and one branch in nevada in connection with the signature transaction the bank assumed all of signatures branches the bank acquired only certain parts of signature it believes to be financially and strategically complementary that are intended to enhance the companys future growth pursuant to the terms of the agreement the company was not required to make a cash payment to the fdic on march as consideration for the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as the company and the fdic remain engaged in ongoing discussions which may impact the assets and liabilities acquired or assumed by the company in the signature transaction the company may be required to make a payment to the fdic or the fdic may be required to make a payment to the company on the settlement date which will be one year after march or as agreed upon by the fdic and the company in addition as part of the consideration for the signature transaction the company granted the fdic equity appreciation rights in the common stock of the company under an equity appreciation instrument the equity appreciation instrument on march the company issued  of company common stock to the fdic pursuant to the equity appreciation instrument on may the fdic completed the secondary offering of those shares the company has determined that the signature transaction constitutes a business combination as defined by asc business combinations asc asc establishes principles and requirements as to how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree accordingly the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded based on their estimated fair values based on initial valuations as of march under the agreement the company is expected to provide certain services to the fdic to assist the fdic in its administration of certain assets and liabilities which were not assumed by the company and which remain under the control of the fdic the interim servicing the interim servicing includes activities related to the servicing of loan portfolios not acquired on behalf of the fdic for a period of up to one year from the date of the signature transaction unless such loans are sold or transferred at an earlier time by the fdic or until cancelled by the fdic upon 60days notice the interim servicing may include other ancillary services requested by the fdic to assist in their administration of the remaining assets and liabilities of signature bank the fdic will reimburse the company for costs associated with the interim servicing based upon an agreed upon fee which approximates the cost to provide such services as the fdic intends to reimburse the company for the costs to service the loans neither a servicing asset nor servicing liability was recognized as part of the signature transaction the company did not enter into a loss sharing arrangement with the fdic in connection with the signature transaction as the company finalizes its analysis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed there may be adjustments to the recorded carrying values in many cases the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed required management to make estimates about discount rates future expected cash flows market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change while the company believes that the information available on june provided a reasonable basis for estimating fair value the company may obtain additional information and evidence during the measurement period that may result in changes to the estimated fair value amounts fair values subject to change include but are not limited to those related to loans and leases certain deposits intangibles deferred tax assets and liabilities and certain other assets and other liabilities a summary of the net assets acquired and the estimated fair value adjustments resulting in the bargain purchase gain is as follows in millions march net assets acquired before fair value adjustments fair value adjustments loans core deposit and other intangibles certificates of deposit other net assets and liabilities fdic equity appreciation instrument deferred tax liability bargain purchase gain on signature transaction as initially reported measurement period adjustments excluding taxes change in deferred tax liability bargain purchase gain on signature transaction as adjusted in connection with the signature transaction the company recorded a bargain purchase gain as adjusted of approximately billion during the six months ended june which is included in noninterest income in the companys consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income the bargain purchase gain represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the assets acquired including cash payments received from the fdic over the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed and is influenced significantly by the fdicassisted transaction process under the fdicassisted transaction process only certain assets and liabilities are transferred to the acquirer and depending on the nature and amount of the acquirers bid the fdic may be required to make a cash payment to the company and the company may be required to make a cash payment to the fdic the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and consideration paid in the signature transaction were initially recorded at their estimated fair values based on managements best estimates using information available at the date of the signature transaction and are subject to adjustment for up to one year after the closing date of the signature transaction the company and the fdic are engaged in ongoing discussions and settlement payments have been made that have impacted certain assets acquired or certain liabilities assumed by the company on march and are included as measurement period adjustments in the table below in millions as initially reported measurement period adjustments as adjusted purchase

identifiable assets bargain purchase gain during the three months ended june the company recorded preliminary measurement period adjustments to adjust the estimated fair value of loans and leases acquired and adjust other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities for balances ultimately retained by the fdic additionally million of loans were returned to the fdic in accordance with the purchase and sale agreement the company also recognized a net change in the deferred tax liability due to the measurement period adjustments and the secondary offering of shares completed by the fdic fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date reflecting assumptions that a market participant would use when pricing an asset or liability in some cases the estimation of fair values requires management to make estimates about discount rates future expected cash flows market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and are subject to change described below are the methods used to determine the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the signature transaction cash and cash equivalents the estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their stated face amounts as these financial instruments are either due on demand or have shortterm maturities loans and leases the fair value for loans was based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered credit loss expectations market interest rates and other market factors such as liquidity from the perspective of a market participant loans were grouped together according to similar characteristics and were treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques the probability of default loss given default and prepayment assumptions were the key factors driving credit losses which were embedded into the estimated cash flows these assumptions were informed by internal data on loan characteristics historical loss experience and current and forecasted economic conditions the interest and liquidity component of the estimate was determined by discounting interest and principal cash flows through the expected life of each loan the discount rates used for loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity the discount rates do not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows acquired loans were marked to fair value and adjusted for any pcd gross up as of the date of the signature transaction deposit liabilities the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity ie noninterestbearing and interestbearing checking accounts is equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand the fair value of certificates of deposit represents contractual cash flows discounted using interest rates currently offered on deposits with similar characteristics and remaining maturities core deposit intangible core deposit intangible cdi is a measure of the value of noninterestbearing and interestbearing checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts that are acquired in a business combination the fair value of the cdi stemming from any given business combination is based on the present value of the expected cost savings attributable to the core deposit funding relative to an alternative source of funding the cdi relating to the signature transaction will be amortized over an estimated useful life of years using the sum of years digits depreciation method the company evaluates such identifiable intangibles for impairment when an indication of impairment exists cdi does not significantly impact our liquidity or capital ratios pcd loans purchased loans that reflect a more than insignificant deterioration of credit from origination are considered pcd for pcd loans and leases the initial estimate of expected credit losses is recognized in the allowance for credit losses acl on the date of acquisition using the same methodology as other loans and leases heldforinvestment the following table provides a summary of loans and leases purchased as part of the signature transaction with credit deterioration and the associated credit loss reserve at acquisition in millions total par value upb acl at acquisition noncredit discount fair value unaudited pro forma information signature transaction the companys operating results for the quarter and yeartodate periods ended june include the operating results of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of signature bridge bank na subsequent to the acquisition on march due to the use of multiple systems and integration of the operating activities into those of the company historical reporting for the former signature operations is impracticable and thus disclosures of the revenue from the assets acquired and income before income taxes is impracticable for the period subsequent to acquisition signature bridge bank na was only in operation from march to march and does not have historical financial information on which we could base pro forma information additionally we did not acquire all assets or assume all liabilities of signature and the historical operations are not consistent with the transaction therefore it is impracticable to provide pro forma information on revenues and earnings for the signature transaction in accordance with asc flagstar bank on december the company closed the acquisition of flagstar bancorp inc flagstar bancorp in an allstock transaction the acquisition of flagstar has been accounted for as a business combination the company recorded the estimate of fair value based on initial valuations available at december the company continues to review these valuations and certain of these estimated fair values are considered preliminary as of june and subject to adjustment for up to one year after december while the company believes that the information available on december provided a reasonable basis for estimating fair value the company may obtain additional information and evidence during the measurement period that would result in changes to the estimated fair value amounts valuations subject to change include but are not limited to loans and leases certain deposits intangibles deferred tax assets and

government agency bonds mortgagebacked securities one mutual fund and one municipal bond the company evaluates availableforsale debt securities in unrealized loss positions at least quarterly to determine if an allowance for credit losses is required we also assess whether i we intend to sell or ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis if either of these criteria is met any previously recognized allowances are charged off and the securitys amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income if neither of the aforementioned criteria are met we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors if this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income in the first quarter of the company held a million corporate bond in signature bank which was placed into receivership on march we have taken a million provision for credit loss and chargedoff this security during the three months ended march none of the remaining unrealized losses identified as of june or december relates to the marketability of the securities or the issuers ability to honor redemption obligations rather the unrealized losses relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased and do not indicate creditrelated impairment management based this conclusion on an analysis of each issuer including a detailed credit assessment of each issuer the company does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the positions before the recovery of their amortized cost basis which may be at maturity as such no allowance for credit losses remains with respect to debt securities as of june note loans and leases the company classifies loans that we have

business administration sba loans to this increase we classify loans as held for sale when we originate or purchase loans that we intend to sell we have elected the fair value option for nearly all of

estimated cash flows using observable inputs inclusive of interest rates prepayment speeds and loss assumptions for similar collateral asset quality all asset quality information excludes lgg that are insured by us government agencies a loan generally is classified as a nonaccrual loan when it is days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because the company no longer expects to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status management ceases the accrual of interest owed and previously accrued interest is charged against interest income a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is current and management has reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible

participates in syndicated loans that are brought to them and equipment loans and leases that are assigned to them by a select group of nationally recognized sources and are generally made to large corporate obligors many of which are publicly traded carry investment grade or nearinvestment grade ratings and participate in stable industries nationwide lease finance receivables are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased assets and any initial direct costs incurred to originate these leases less unearned income which is accreted to interest income over the lease term using the interest method the standard leases are typically repayable on a level monthly basis with terms ranging from to months at the end of the lease term the lessee usually has the option to return the equipment to renew the lease or purchase the equipment at the then fair market value fmv price for leases with a fmv renewalpurchase option the relevant residual value assumptions are based on the estimated value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term including evaluation of key factors such as the estimated remaining useful life of the leased asset its historical secondary market value including history of the lessee executing the fmv option overall credit evaluation and return provisions the company acquires the leased asset at fair market value and provides funding to the respective lessee at acquisition cost less any volume or trade discounts as applicable therefore there is generally no selling profit or loss to recognize or defer at inception of a lease the residual value component of a lease financing receivable represents the estimated fair value of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term in establishing residual value estimates the company may rely on industry data historical experience and independent appraisals and where appropriate information regarding product life cycle product upgrades and competing products upon expiration of a lease residual assets are remarketed resulting in either an extension of the lease by the lessee a lease to a new customer or purchase of the residual asset by the lessee or another party impairment of residual values arises if the expected fair value is less than the carrying amount the company assesses its net investment in lease financing receivables including residual values for impairment on an annual basis with any impairment losses recognized in accordance with the impairment guidance for financial instruments as such net investment in lease financing receivables may be reduced by an allowance for credit losses with changes recognized as provision expense on certain lease financings the company obtains residual value insurance from third

servicing rights the company has investments in msrs that result from the sale of loans to the secondary market for which we retain the servicing the company accounts for msrs at their fair value a primary risk associated with msrs is the potential reduction in fair value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments due to loan refinancing prompted in part by declining interest rates or government intervention conversely these assets generally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than anticipated the company utilizes derivatives as economic hedges to offset changes in the fair value of the msrs resulting from the actual or anticipated changes in prepayments stemming from changing interest rate environments there is also a risk of valuation decline due to higher than expected default rates which we do not believe can be effectively managed using derivatives for further information regarding the derivative

fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis gaap also clarifies that fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received when selling an asset or paid when transferring a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants fair value is thus a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability as a basis for considering such assumptions gaap establishes a threetier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level inputs to the valuation methodology are significant unobservable inputs that reflect a companys own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability a financial instruments categorization within this valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the following tables present assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of june and december and that were included in the companys consolidated statements of condition at those dates june in millions quoted prices in active markets for identical assets

fair value hierarchy classifications for its assets on a quarterly basis changes from one quarter to the next that are related to the observability of inputs for a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification from one hierarchy level to another a description of the methods and significant assumptions utilized in estimating the fair values of securities follows where quoted prices are available in an active market securities are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy level securities include highly liquid government securities and exchangetraded securities if quoted market prices are not available for a specific security then fair values are estimated by using pricing models these pricing models primarily use marketbased or independently sourced market parameters as inputs including but not limited to yield curves interest rates equity or debt prices and credit spreads in addition to observable market information models incorporate transaction details such as maturity and cash flow assumptions securities valued in this manner would generally be classified within level of the valuation hierarchy and primarily include such instruments as mortgagerelated and corporate debt securities periodically the company uses fair values supplied by independent pricing services to corroborate the fair values derived from the pricing models in addition the company reviews the fair values supplied by independent pricing services as well as their underlying pricing methodologies for reasonableness the company challenges pricing service valuations that appear to be unusual or unexpected while the company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair values of certain financial instruments could result in different estimates of fair values at a reporting date fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs the

value of the instruments assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis such instruments are subject to fair value adjustments under certain circumstances eg when there is evidence of impairment the following tables present assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of june and december and that were

infrequency of the observable prices andor the restrictions on the shares represents the fair value of impaired loans based on the value of the collateral the fair values of collateraldependent impaired loans are determined using various valuation techniques including consideration of appraised values and other pertinent real estate and other market data other fair value disclosures for the disclosure of fair value information about the companys on and offbalance sheet financial instruments when available quoted market prices are used as the measure of fair value in cases where quoted market prices are not available fair values are based on presentvalue estimates or other valuation techniques such fair values are significantly affected by the assumptions used the timing of future cash flows and the discount rate because assumptions are inherently subjective in nature estimated fair values cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent market quotes furthermore in many cases the estimated fair values provided would not necessarily be realized in an immediate sale or settlement of such instruments the following tables summarize the carrying values estimated fair values and fair value measurement levels of financial instruments that were not carried at fair value on the companys consolidated statements of condition at june and december june fair value

money market accounts savings accounts and noninterestbearing accounts certificates of deposit the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair values for the companys financial instruments follow cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and federal funds sold the estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents are assumed to equal their carrying values as these financial instruments are either due on demand or have shortterm maturities securities if quoted market prices are not available for a specific security then fair values are estimated by using pricing models quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows these pricing models primarily use marketbased or independently sourced market parameters as inputs including but not limited to yield curves interest rates equity or debt prices and credit spreads in addition to observable market information pricing models also incorporate transaction details such as maturities and cash flow assumptions federal home loan bank stock ownership in equity securities of the fhlb is generally restricted and there is no established liquid market for their resale the carrying amount approximates the fair value loans the company discloses the fair value of loans measured at amortized cost using an exit price notion the company determined the fair value on substantially all of its loans for disclosure purposes on an individual loan basis the discount rates reflect current market rates for loans with similar terms to borrowers having similar credit quality on an exit price basis the estimated fair values of nonperforming mortgage and other loans are based on recent collateral appraisals for those loans where a discounted cash flow technique was not considered reliable the company used a quoted market price for each individual loan msrs the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the msrs are option adjusted spreads prepayment rates and cost to service significant increases decreases in all three assumptions in isolation result in a significantly lower higher fair value measurement weighted average life in years is used to determine the change in fair value of msrs for june the weighted average life in years for the entire msr portfolio was rate lock commitments the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the rate lock commitments is the pull through rate the pull through rate is a statistical analysis of our actual rate lock fallout history to determine the sensitivity of the residential mortgage loan pipeline compared to interest rate changes and other deterministic values new market prices are applied based on updated loan characteristics and new fallout ratios ie the inverse of the pull through rate are applied accordingly significant increases decreases in the pull through rate in isolation result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement deposits the fair values of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity ie interestbearing checking and money market accounts savings accounts and noninterestbearing accounts are equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand the fair values of cds represent contractual cash flows discounted using interest rates currently offered on deposits with similar characteristics and remaining maturities these estimated fair values do not include the intangible value of core deposit relationships which comprise a portion of the companys deposit base borrowed funds the estimated fair value of borrowed funds is based either on bid quotations received from securities dealers or the discounted value of contractual cash flows with interest rates currently in effect for borrowed funds with similar maturities and structures offbalance sheet financial instruments the fair values of commitments to extend credit and unadvanced lines of credit are estimated based on an analysis of the interest rates and fees currently charged to enter into similar transactions considering the remaining terms of the commitments and the creditworthiness of the potential borrowers the estimated fair values of such offbalance sheet financial instruments were insignificant at june and december fair value option we elected the fair value option for certain items as discussed throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements to more closely align the accounting method with the underlying economic exposure interest income on lhfs is accrued on
