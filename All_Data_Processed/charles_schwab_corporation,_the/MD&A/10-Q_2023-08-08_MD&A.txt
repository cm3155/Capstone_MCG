expenditures of between billion and billion the companys estimates of the nature amounts and timing of recognition of acquisition and integrationrelated costs remain subject to change based on a number of factors including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the continued uncertainty of the economic environment more specifically factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integrationrelated costs include the level of employee attrition and availability of thirdparty labor workforce redeployment from eliminated positions into open roles changes in the levels of client activity as well as changes in the scope and cost of technology and real estaterelated exit cost variability due to effects of changes in remote working

noted paid over eight quarters beginning in the first quarter of any special assessment will be recognized fully in earnings upon enactment of a final rule in december the sec proposed a set of four related equity market structure rules that would make significant changes to how national market system nms stock orders are priced executed and reported the four proposed rules are described below the order competition rule would require that before most individual investors orders could be executed internally by a trading center like wholesaler market makers those orders must first be exposed to a qualifying orderbyorder auction in which both market makers and institutional investors can participate regulation best execution would establish an seclevel best execution standard in addition to the existing finra and msrb best execution rules for brokerdealers and require them to establish maintain and enforce written policies and procedures addressing how the brokerdealer will comply with the best execution standard and make routing or execution decisions for customer orders regulation best execution would apply not only to equities but to all securities amendments to rule of regulation nms requiring enhanced disclosures of order execution quality for large brokers that handle retail orders a rule to i amend minimum pricing increments or tick sizes that would apply to both the quoting and trading of nms stocks ii reduce the exchange access fee caps and iii require transparency of oddlots the comment periods for the proposed rules ended on march and the impact to schwab cannot be assessed until final rules are released in november the sec proposed a rule that would require substantial changes to the liquidity risk management programs for openend mutual funds other than money market funds funds and require them to implement swing pricing and impose a hard close on the acceptance of purchase and redemption orders swing pricing would require funds to adjust the funds current net asset value nav per share by a swing factor if the fund has either i net redemptions no threshold or ii net purchases that exceed a specified threshold of the funds net assets to implement the swing pricing requirements the proposed rule also would require that a fund its transfer agent or a registered clearing agency receive purchase and redemption orders prior to the time the fund has established for determining the nav typically market close in order to receive a given days nav a hard close current practices permit fund orders received by a financial intermediary prior to the fund cutoff time to be transmitted to the fund after the fund cutoff time and for the order to receive that days nav under the proposed rule orders received by the fund its transfer agent or registered clearing agency after the fund cutoff time would receive the next days nav the comment period for the proposed rule ended on february and the impact to schwab cannot be assessed until

for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets to manage interest rate risk we have established policies and procedures which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity eve risk to remain within these limits we manage the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios management monitors established guidelines to stay within the companys risk appetite in the company began to utilize interest rate swap derivative instruments to assist with managing interest rate risk for further information on our interest rate risk management strategies utilizing interest rate swaps see item note interest rate risk simulations net interest revenue simulation for our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulations include all balance sheet interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors rates and balances of nonmaturity client cash held on the balance sheet prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include investment securities margin loans bank loans and cash and cash equivalents these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted conditions when we have liquidity needs that exceed our primary sources of funding the company has needed to utilize higher cost funding sources which can reduce net interest margin and net interest revenue net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates while this approach is useful to isolate the impact of changes in interest rates on a staticallysized asset and liability structure it does not capture changes to client cash allocations we conduct simulations on eve to capture the impact of client cash allocation changes on our balance sheet as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure we have taken and would typically seek to take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment higher shortterm interest rates would generally positively impact net interest margin as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources if the cost of funding sources is greater than the increased revenue from repricing assets however net interest margin can be reduced a decline in shortterm interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the companys investment and loan portfolios to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin the following table shows simulated changes to net interest revenue over the next months beginning june and december of a gradual increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period june december increase of basis points increase of basis points increase of basis points decrease of basis points decrease of basis points decrease of basis points the companys simulated incremental increases in market interest rates had a larger impact on net interest revenue as of june compared to december primarily due to higher cash and margin loan balances which was partially offset by an increased allocation to fhlb borrowings and other shortterm borrowings across the companys banking subsidiaries simulated incremental decreases in market interest rates had a larger impact on net interest revenue as of june compared to december primarily due to higher cash and margin loan balances while increased allocation to shorterterm liabilities contributed to lower interest expense in a lower rate environment in addition to measuring the effect of gradual parallel increases or decreases in current interest rates we regularly simulate the effects of nonparallel shifts and instantaneous shifts of interest rates on net interest revenue bank deposit account fees simulation consistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above as of june and december simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates under the interest rate scenarios described above for net interest revenue did not have a significant impact on the companys total net revenues economic value of equity simulation management also uses eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates behavior of nonmaturity client cash held on the balance sheet and pricing assumptions our net interest revenue bank deposit account

accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are discussed in part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates in the form 10k there have been no changes to critical accounting estimates during the first six months of nongaap financial measures in addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain references to the nongaap financial measures described below we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the company and facilitate meaningful comparison of schwabs results in the current period to both historic and future results these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to nongaap financial measures presented by other companies schwabs use of nongaap measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to gaap financial measures as described below nongaap adjustment or measure definition usefulness to investors and uses by management acquisition and integrationrelated costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets schwab adjusts certain gaap financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integrationrelated costs incurred as a result of the companys acquisitions amortization of acquired intangible assets and where applicable the income tax effect of these expenses adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets which were recorded as part of purchase accounting these acquired intangible assets contribute to the companys revenue generation amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives we exclude acquisition and integrationrelated costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain nongaap measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of schwabs ongoing operations and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods acquisition and integrationrelated costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities thereby limiting comparability of results among periods and are not representative of the costs of running the companys ongoing business amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the companys underlying operating performance return on tangible common equity return on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill acquired intangible assets net and related deferred tax liabilities acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of schwabs balance sheet adjusted tier leverage ratio adjusted tier leverage ratio represents the tier leverage ratio as prescribed by bank regulatory guidance for the consolidated company and for csb adjusted to reflect the inclusion of aoci in the ratio inclusion of the impacts of aoci in the companys tier leverage ratio provides additional information regarding the companys current capital position we believe adjusted tier leverage ratio may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure of the companys capital levels the company also uses adjusted diluted eps and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements the compensation committee of cscs board of directors maintains discretion in evaluating performance against these criteria the charles schwab corporation managements
