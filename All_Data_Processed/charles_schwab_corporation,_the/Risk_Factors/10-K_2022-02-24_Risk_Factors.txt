item risk factors we face a variety of risks that may affect our operations financial results or stock price and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect our operations or financial results for a discussion of our risk management governance and processes including operational risk compliance risk credit risk market risk and liquidity risk see risk management and capital management in part ii item economic and market risks the challenging economic environment triggered by the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has impacted and will continue to impact our business results of operations and financial condition the onset of the covid19 pandemic adversely impacted the economic environment and credit markets leading to lower interest rates across the curve heightened volatility in the financial markets and marketdriven credit spread movements in certain sectors within our portfolio of investment securities although certain economic conditions improved in the pandemic continues to evolve and certain impacts of the pandemic including shortterm interest rates may continue to have a negative impact on our net interest revenue bank deposit account fee revenue and asset management and administration fees additionally in march we experienced a significant increase in client cash balances held at our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries which caused our tier leverage ratio to decline into the buffer we maintain between our longterm operating objective and our regulatory requirement we will continue to have limits on our ability to return excess capital to stockholders including through share repurchases until the ratio returns to higher levels the pandemic has also impacted our client service quality at times certain of our client service response and processing times increased as a result of very high levels of client engagement and our clients experienced and may continue to occasionally experience delays accessing and using our website and mobile applications while we have focused on hiring additional client service employees we like many employers continue to face challenges retaining and hiring employees in addition we recently experienced and may again experience staffing shortages at our call centers and branches due to the rapid spread of new variants of covid19 many of our employees and those of our outsourced service providers are working remotely and this has at times contributed to the increase in response and processing times particularly when we have experienced the temporary loss of services from some of our outsourced service providers we consider service quality to be an important part of the client experience and our failure to meet client expectations could result in decreased client satisfaction these and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic have had and will likely continue to have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described elsewhere in this risk factors section the extent to which the covid19 pandemic or the emergence of another widespread health crisis impacts our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain including the scope and duration of the outbreak actions taken by governmental authorities to contain the financial and economic impact and the spread of the outbreak the effect on our clients employees and outsourced service providers changes in credit quality and spreads and reactions in the financial markets developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business our business can be adversely affected by the general environment economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of our control deterioration in the housing and credit markets reduction in interest rates and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources the charles schwab corporation the monetary policies of the federal reserve which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states have a significant effect on our operating results actions taken by the federal reserve including changes in its target funds rate and balance sheet management are difficu lt to predict and can affect our net interest revenue and bank deposit account fees these policies could also have implications for clients allocation to cash higher or lower client cash balances have an impact on our capital requirements as well as liquidity implications if such changes in allocation are sudden a significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our income we rely heavily on client cash balances to generate revenue cash awaiting investment in a portion of our client brokerage accounts is swept to our banking subsidiaries and those bank deposits are then used to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities we also sweep a portion of such cash to unconsolidated thirdparty financial institutions pursuant to the ida agreement and agreements with other thirdparty financial institutions through which we earn bank deposit account fees a significant reduction in our clients allocation to cash a change in the allocation of that cash or a transfer of cash away from the company could reduce our income significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings a decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue and our bank deposit account fee revenue a low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues when we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients the significant reduction in interest rates related to the covid19 pandemic has had and will continue to have a negative impact on our revenue related to interest rates and has caused us to waive management fees for certain funds although we believe we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interestearning assets can reduce our net interest revenue the announced phaseout of the london interbank offered rate libor could negatively impact our net interest revenue and will continue to require operational work certain securities in our investment portfolio the floating rate loans we offered and certain series of our outstanding preferred stock reference libor as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate payment amount or floating dividend rates while we have substantially transitioned our financial models and systems away from libor in limited circumstances we still use libor when libor is discontinued as announced there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments this could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions the calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest revenue libor may also perform differently during the phaseout period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain securities in our investment portfolio in addition further operational work will be required to transition our legacy loan portfolio to alternate reference rates that are consistent with the fallback language included in the contracts see also part ii item risk management for additional information regarding the companys consideration of the phaseout of libor compliance risks extensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries we are subject to extensive regulation under federal state and foreign laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros the costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase these regulations affect our business operations and impose capital client prote ction and market conduct requirements on us as well as restrictions on the activities that we are allowed to conduct we become subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as we grow regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could prevent us from pursuing our business strategy regulators could also limit our ability to grow including adding assets launching new products making acquisitions and undertaking strategic investments our banking regulators could require csc andor our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital increase liquidity or limit their ability to pay dividends or cscs ability to repurchase or redeem shares despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements there are a the charles schwab corporation number of risks particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension disqualification or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on our business activities any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition while we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations violations could occur in addition some legalregulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time there may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance including restrictions on certain activities such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results new legislation rules regulations and guidance or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state foreign and sro rules regulations and guidance including changes relating to mutual funds standards of conduct with clients conflicts of interest regulatory treatment of deposit accounts and order routing practices and orderrelated revenues may directly affect our operations and profitability or our specific business lines our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data in addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct modifications to our business practices more stringent capital and liquidity requirements increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance risk management treasury and operations functions failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition csc together with its banking brokerdealer and fcmfdm subsidiaries must meet certain capital and liquidity standards subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of our capital and our internal assessment of our capital needs the uniform net capital rule limits the ability of our brokerdealer entities to transfer capital to csc and other affiliates new regulatory capital liquidity capital planning and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including paying dividends stock repurchases and redemptions and may require us to increase our capital andor liquidity or to limit our growth failure by either csc or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a negative impact on us in addition failure by csc or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as tier capital or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets deleverage or otherwise change our business andor investment plans which may adversely affect our financial results issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders in january the federal reserve adopted a final rule effective with the ccar cycle making large savings and loan holding companies including csc subject to the ccar process which requires submission of an annual capital plan the plan must include a description of all planned capital actions including dividends or stock repurchases over a ninequarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted the rule also imposes a stress capital buffer requirement floored at percent of riskweighted assets that will replace cscs current percent capital conservation buffer for our riskbased capital ratios the stress capital buffer will equal as a percentage of total riskweighted assets the sum of i the difference between a firms starting common equity tier capital ratio and the low point under the severely adverse scenario of the federal reserves supervisory stress test plus ii the ratio of the firms projected four quarters of common stock dividends for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon to riskweighted assets as projected under ccar the imposition of a stress capital buffer requirement could change the way in which our minimum riskbased capital ratios are calculated and make us subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions if we approach our minimum ratios this could lead to restrictions on our ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to stockholders the charles schwab corporation if the average of cscs total consolidated assets for four consecutive calendar quarters reaches billion or if the average of crossjurisdictional activity for four consecutive calendar quarters reaches billion csc will become subject to more stringent category ii requirements including annual stress testing the advanced approaches framework and the inability to opt out of including aoci in regulatory capital calculations at december csc had approximately billion in total assets and crossjurisdictional activity of approximately billion we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings the financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages we are also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied with us claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors misconduct litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if we were found to have infringed on a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights we could incur substantial damages and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services actions brought against us may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to us including reputational harm even if we are successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in us incurring significant expenses a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on our results for that period in market downturns and periods of heightened volatility the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased operational risk security breaches of our systems or those of our clients or third parties may subject us to significant liability and damage our reputation our business involves the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us information security risks for financial institutions are increasing in part because of the use of the internet and mobile and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime activists hackers and other external parties including foreign state actors our systems and those of other financial institutions have been and will continue to be the target of cyber attacks malicious code computer viruses ransomware and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example employee misconduct given the high volume of transactions that we process the large number of clients counterparties and thirdparty service providers with which we do business including cloud service providers and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected the extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack security breaches including breaches of our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers or clients could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance actions by our regulators damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in our security measures the charles schwab corporation which could harm our business we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures we also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients user names passwords or other personal information to gain access to our clients financial accounts this could occur from the compromise of clients personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties including foreign statesponsored parties losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations technology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses litigation regulatory actions and reputational damage we must process record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems system interruptions errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to our systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error execution errors errors in models such as those used for asset management capital planning and management risk management stress testing and compliance employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks cyber attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster extreme weather power outage capacity constraints software flaws events impacting key business partners and vendors and similar events for example we and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have in certain circumstances made websites mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time cloud technologies are critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing cloud service disruptions may lead to delays in accessing data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients access to our platforms it could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact our reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances the ways that fraudulent activity is attempted is continuously evolving and while we monitor for new types of fraud there may be a delay in recognizing the fraud is happening besides potential losses shutting down the fraudulent activity often requires a balance with client experience despite our efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of our vendors or other third parties while we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of our systems extraordinary trading volumes such as those that occurred in and the first quarter of could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate for example certain of our client service response and processing times increased in as a result of very high levels of client engagement and our clients experienced delays accessing our systems during periods when there was an unusually high volume of client activity disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses decreased client satisfaction reputational damage and regulatory inquiries we are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses market makers dealers and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement system failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices and cancelled orders cause substantial losses for us and for our clients and subject us to claims from our clients for damages and cause reputational harm our investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses fund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as recordkeeping and accounting security pricing corporate actions compliance with investment restrictions daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions penalties or litigation and result in reputational damage liability to clients and the termination of investment management or administration agreements and the withdrawal of assets under our management the charles schwab corporation in the management and administration of funds and client accounts we use quantitative models and other tools and resources to support investment decisions and processes including those related to risk assessment portfolio management trading and hedging activities and product valuations errors in the design function or underlying assumptions used in these models and tools particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for makewhole payments litigation andor regulatory fines we rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions we rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology cloud infrastructure processing servicing and support functions these service providers face technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause us to incur losses and could harm our reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties natural disasters extreme weather power outage public health crises political developments or for any other reason and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in financial losses to us as a result of certain stay at home restrictions related to the covid19 pandemic we temporarily lost the services from some of our outsourced service providers which contributed to increased client service response and processing times switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations we rely on financial intermediaries to execute and settle client orders we rely on market makers dealers securities exchanges clearing houses and other financial intermediaries to execute and settle our clients orders the unwillingness or inability of any of these parties to perform their usual functions coupled with the unavailability of alternative arrangements could result in our clients orders not getting executed or settled this may be due to market volatility uneconomic trading conditions capacity constraints financial constraints system failures unanticipated trading halts invoked by securities exchanges market closures or other reasons our inability to get client orders executed or settled because of the unwillingness or inability of these parties to perform their usual functions could result in client dissatisfaction and reputational harm and expose us to client claims for damages liquidity risk a significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in us maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations including transaction settlement custody requirements and lending commitments among other liquidity needs we meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity as well as external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs a reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in us which could result in the transfer of client assets and accounts or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements including the lcr in addition if our brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc which could reduce cscs liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt pay dividends on cscs preferred stock or return capital to common stockholders in addition csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include csco and tdac having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in our lending activities including margin mortgagerelated and personal lending increased capital requirements changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations other regulatory changes or a loss of market or client confidence in us resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds as a member firm of securities and derivatives clearing houses we are required to deposit cash stock andor government securities for margin requirements and to clearing funds the margin requirements may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients trading activity and market volatility for example as a result of recent market volatility the national securities clearing corporation increased margin requirements for member firms and we were required to deposit additional funds clearing houses could also require additional funds from member firms if a clearing member defaults on its obligations to the clearing house in an amount larger than its own margin and clearing fund deposits the charles schwab corporation when available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs we may seek external financing during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase although csc csco and tdac maintain uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec which can be used to sell securities financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets in addition a significant downgrade in the companys credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets credit risk we may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures our businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective our exposure mainly results from margin lending clients options and futures trading securities lending mortgage lending pledged asset lending our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor when clients purchase securities on margin borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities or trade options or futures we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients indebtedness abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses especially if there is a lack of liquidity as a result of our td ameritrade acquisition our margin options and futures business has materially increased and market liquidity may represent an increased risk we have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments those investments are subject to price fluctuations loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss the evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of multiple factors if management determines that a securitys decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time our bank loans primarily consist of first mortgages helocs and pals increases in delinquency and default rates housing and stock price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors including from the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense as well as write downs on such loans heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss examples include large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry mortgage loans and helocs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region and client margins options or futures pledged assets and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer index or industry we sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds although we have no obligation to do so we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause us to take significant charges could reduce our liquidity and in certain situations could with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds result in us having to consolidate one or more funds in our financial statements if we choose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation we could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected the charles schwab corporation risks related to our td ameritrade acquisition we may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the td ameritrade acquisition which could adversely affect the value of our stock the success of our td ameritrade acquisition will continue to depend in significant part on our ability to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from integrating the businesses of schwab and td ameritrade which is subject to certain risks if we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of schwab and td ameritrade within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected the combined business may not perform as expected and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key schwab or td ameritrade employees the loss of clients the disruption of either companys or both companies ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall postcompletion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated most of the integration planning and execution work is currently being done remotely due to the covid19 pandemic the inability to work inperson and onsite with information technology and management oversight has and will continue to make some of the integration work more challenging particularly with regard to technology we will need to continue to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff and rely on a number of critical technology vendors in order to complete the integration work relating to technology platforms and systems within the target timeframe in addition we may experience delays in acquiring the technology and infrastructure components needed for the integration due to pandemicrelated supply chain disruptions we have to make certain assumptions for integration planning and subsequent changes to integration plans impact the timing and cost of the integration for example as a result of the higher levels of trading volumes that we recently experienced we had to increase capacity from the original technology buildout plan in addition at times the attention of certain members of our management and other resources may be diverted from integration work to critical daytoday business operations we may also encounter challenges integrating td ameritrade technologies into schwab platforms any of these factors could make timely achievement of integration milestones more challenging particularly with regard to technology and systems we will continue to incur significant integration costs in connection with the integration of td ameritrade we will continue to incur significant nonrecurring costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans with respect to combining the operations of schwab and td ameritrade including technologyrelated workforce and facilities consolidation costs we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies businesses we may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executives and other employees during the integration of td ameritrade uncertainty about the effect of the td ameritrade integration on schwab and td ameritrade employees may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate personnel employee retention may be particularly challenging during the integration process as employees of schwab and td ameritrade may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business if employees of schwab or td ameritrade depart the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined business may be harmed furthermore we may have to incur significant costs in identifying hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the businesses of schwab or td ameritrade and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may be adversely affected in addition there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with integrating employees into schwab the charles schwab corporation the td ameritrade acquisition may not be accretive to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock based on the anticipated synergies between schwab and td ameritrade we expect the acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share in the third year following completion of the merger however future events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the acquisition being dilutive to our earnings per share including adverse changes in market conditions additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition any dilution of reduction in or delay of any accretion to our earnings per share could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate other business risks potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position we evaluate potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows the process of evaluating negotiating effecting and integrating any such strategic transaction may divert managements attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas the integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or changes to inconsistent standards controls procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients employees outsourced service providers and vendors in addition an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings or require the amortization of a large amount of acquired intangible assets further we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition in a timely manner or at all including without limitation the recent acquisition of td ameritrade and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders percentage ownership or to earnings per common share eps our acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business operations or financial condition of the entity or part of an entity being acquired or sold to the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity or part of an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all if a material transaction does not close our stock price could decline our industry is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price competition we operate in a highly competitive environment with a broad array of competitors from large integrated banks to venturecapital backed private companies we continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust interest rates on deposits and loans fees for advisory services expense ratios on mutual funds and etfs trade commission rates and other pricing and incentives to sustain our competitive position increased price competition from other financial services firms to attract clients such as reduced commissions higher deposit rates reduced mutual fund or etf expense ratios or the increased use of incentives could impact our results of operations and financial condition we face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees the market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive at various times different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market compelling us to pay more to attract talent recently the challenge and cost for us to retain and hire talent has increased in september we implemented a salary increase for almost all of our employees our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs we need to continue to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff to complete the td ameritrade integration work within the target timeframe demand for skilled technology professionals is high and we may experience delays in hiring the appropriate skilled resources the charles schwab corporation our stock price has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate our stock price can be volatile among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following speculation in the investment community or the press about or actual changes in our competitive position organizational structure executive team operations financial condition financial reporting and results expense discipline strategic transactions progress on achieving the expected benefits from our td ameritrade acquisition or ratings from third parties the announcement of new products services acquisitions or dispositions by us or our competitors increases or decreases in revenue or earnings changes in earnings estimates by the investment community and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results and sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by large stockholders changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns our industry as well as geopolitical corporate regulatory business and economic factors may also affect our stock price future sales of cscs equity securities may adversely affect the market price of cscs common stock and result in dilution cscs certificate of incorporation authorizes cscs board of directors among other things to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities without stockholder approval csc may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes the issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of cscs common stock and may adversely affect the market price of cscs common stock our ongoing relationships with td bank and its affiliates could have a negative impact on us although our acquisition of td ameritrade was structured such that completion of the merger would not result in csc either i being deemed to be controlled by td bank as that term is interpreted by the federal reserve under the bhc act or hola or ii being deemed to be in control of any of td banks depository institutions changes in circumstances could trigger presumptions of control under the federal reserves regulations this could occur if td bank and its affiliates own more than of schwab common stock as interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of the federal reserve while the stockholder agreement between csc and td bank prohibits td bank and its affiliates from exceeding the threshold it could happen unintentionally this presumption of control could also be triggered if the revenue generated to either us or to any of the td bank depository institutions exceeds a certain percentage the stockholder agreement contains provisions to address such situations under the ida agreement we are only permitted to reduce the deposit balances swept to the td depository institutions by a set amount during each 12month period subject to certain limitations and adjustments including only moving ida balances designated as floatingrate obligations and maintaining a minimum billion ida sweep balance through june the bank deposit account fee revenue that we earn related to the ida agreement may be less than the net interest revenue that we could have earned if the deposit balances were swept to our banking subsidiaries rather than the td depository institutions when we are permitted to reduce the ida balances we can only move the balances to our banking subsidiaries if we have sufficient capital in addition in a low rate environment it is possible that the sweep arrangement fee computation could result in a negative amount that we would be required to pay the td depository institutions resulting in us having an expense rather than revenue
