management discussion section jeff edwards managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp good morning everyone and welcome to the schwab summer business update this is jeff edwards head of investor relations and im joined today by our cochairman and ceo walt bettinger president rick wurster and cfo peter crawford we got a bit of an early start today to beat the texas heat so lets run through our housekeeping items and get in todays remarks the slides for todays business update will be posted to the usual spot on the ir website at the beginning of peters section qa remains structured as one question no followups please but you can certainly reenter the queue to ask another question if time permits and as always please dont hesitate to reach out with any followup questions for the ir team and lastly the wallboards which showcases our forwardlooking statements reminding us that the future is uncertain so please stay in touch with our disclosures and with that ill turn it over to walt walter william bettinger cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp thank you jeff and good morning everyone thanks for joining us for our july business update earlier this year we spoke about being a transition year for the firm we define this year as transitional for a series of reasons we were anticipating completing the last transition groups from the ameritrade acquisition and we anticipated that former ameritrade clients would move from negative asset flows to positive levels of net new assets we further anticipated that former ameritrade retail clients would begin to utilize schwab capabilities in the areas of investment advisory financial planning and banking we anticipated the investment advisors who formerly used ameritrade for custodial services would also begin to bring net new assets to schwab and their evaluation of our service levels would improve rather dramatically we anticipated that schwab users of streetsmart would begin to take advantage of the powerful trading capabilities in the thinkorswim platforms from a capital standpoint we anticipated that we would organically build capital throughout the year toward over our longterm objectives from a financial standpoint we anticipated improving albeit somewhat uneven earnings results during the year with  delivering somewhere between and and then with strong growth continuing into and beyond halfway through the year this definition of a transition year is being realized again as we anticipated and all of these issues position us for a strong period of growth in client metrics and financial results in the coming years so with these critical indicators of success unfolding in such a positive manner lets take a quick look tactically at how the second quarter of this year looked inflation showed some encouraging signs of moderating closer to the fed target of which continued pushing a select number of primarily technology stocks ever higher during the quarter investor sentiment remained solidly positive at quarterend with investors purchasing stocks throughout the quarter and overall trading activity was a bit higher than in the prior year and as we stated earlier as we anticipated we completed the last client transition group during the second quarter thats almost trillion in assets million client accounts and over million daily average trades all done with attrition levels that are well below other integrations in our industry as well as our estimates at the time the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 of the acquisition which were to asset attrition and revenue attrition and while its still somewhat early the client response to the combined platform has been even stronger than we anticipated promoter scores for former ameritrade retail clients are now increasing about points nine months post conversion date while the promoter scores for advisor services including the former ameritrade advisor clients have returned to preconversion levels impressively former ameritrade retail clients who converted in are already bringing in assets on a net basis however their level of net new assets still remains below our target range clearly this illustrates that were reaching an inflection point as attrition continues to abate and we rebuild back to firmwide net new asset levels in our targeted to range and lastly former ameritrade retail clients are already making up about onethird of our overall enrollments in advisory solutions an early illustration of the power of combining the two firms and their interest in schwabs broader offering of wealth management solutions our overall client engagement was solid in the second quarter with the equity buysell ratio at about while daily average trades remained at relatively high levels for a second quarter and above the same period from last year meanwhile weve seen a large increase in interest among our clients in our managed investing solutions so overall key client metrics continue to be solid net new assets yeartodate were over billion including  asset gathering of about billion up from the same period last year again still somewhat below our longterm goal of to through an economic cycle but growing closer to that figure as the impact from former ameritrade client attrition begins to wane new brokerage accounts were again almost million im sorry million accounts during the quarter now looking deeper at the types of clients were attracting these newtofirm households continue to set us up well for the long term with almost out of new clients under the age of and investment advisor clients of all sizes continue to entrust their client assets to our custodial services for years weve emphasized that schwab advisor services is the premier offering for rias of all sizes and we are equally committed to each segment of advisors and these net new asset results are particularly encouraging as they reflect our success serving again every size advisor let me take a brief step back to take a more big picture look at schwab and the growth trajectory weve been on for over years from our origins as a discount broker we have continually listened to client needs as well as anticipated client needs and added services and capabilities along the way what is key is that we have always done so in a schwab way through clients eyes at a great value and without the clients having to accept trade offs we call that modern wealth management and when we look to the future we believe this formula will only serve to build our market share larger and larger of course one of the key capabilities weve added along the way has been banking services to meet the needs of our clients on both sides of their personal balance sheets now some have asked us after the regional banking crisis of whether we remain committed to serving our clients banking needs and the answer is a definite yes that said we have studied our approach to offering banking services in recent quarters and wanted to share a few additional perspectives on how we see banking unfolding in the future at schwab offering lending services to our retail clients and the clients of the investment advisors we serve is important arguably its critical as it meets client needs and deepens relationships in a meaningful way most of our significant competitors have the ability to assist clients with both their investing needs as well as their borrowing needs we believe firms that do not offer lending services are at a strategic disadvantage that will show itself more and more over time so we are committed to offering quality lending services in a manner consistent with the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 how we lend today exclusively for our clients residential mortgages helocs for clients who have their first mortgage with us and pledged asset lines and to support lending for our clients we continued to invest in both technology to make the application and approval process streamlined and efficient as well as experienced bankers who can help shepherd the more complex loans through from the standpoint of the investments we make at the bank for deposits in excess of those needed for lending to our clients over time and by that i mean years not months or quarters we would envision some shortening of our overall balance sheet investment portfolio duration that could lead to some modestly higher earnings volatility through an interest rate cycle but should help reduce volatility of our capital levels and the need to access supplemental borrowing when interest rates potentially rise rapidly one of our objectives is to increase our emphasis on attracting transactional bank deposits like checking balances with our awardwinning checking product this would serve as a means of increasing liquidity and further stabilizing our overall deposit base and we envision the potential to increase our usage of thirdparty banks like td bank and others to achieve the following goals deliver extended fdic insurance for clients lower our capital intensity and improve liquidity subject of course to obtaining economics from the thirdparty banks that makes sense for us net these various actions should lead again over time to a bank that is somewhat smaller than our bank has been in recent years while retaining the ability to meet our clients banking needs lower our capital intensity and importantly protect the economics we are able to generate from owning a bank so while we see some modest changes in the way we manage and operate our bank one thing you can count on we will continue to operate our business in the schwab way making decisions through clients eyes offering clients great value and delivering service and advice to our valued clients without asking for any tradeoffs so rick let me turn it over to you for some more discussion on our efforts as well as results during the second quarter richard a wurster president the charles schwab corp thanks walt and good morning everyone with the successful completion of the ameritrade conversion behind us we are looking ahead to an exciting new chapter as we continue to advance our four strategic focus areas and we will do so from a position of strength having fully combined the best of schwab and ameritrade to offer our clients a no tradeoff experience our ability to increase our scale while also continuously driving efficiency in our operations remains one of our key competitive advantages the ameritrade integration is a clear example of how we have vastly increased our scale while cutting costs and by the end of this year well realize the remaining of run rate expense synergies from the acquisition over time our growing client base our cost discipline and our ongoing investments in technology will continue to help us reduce our cost to serve our clients in the same way it has over the past decade as we decreased our cost per client account by excuse me and by around when you consider inflation we plan to build on this competitive advantage we will invest in technology including artificial intelligence that will ultimately help us lower our costs we will implement operational enhancements and process transformation so we can serve our clients even more efficiently than we do today and as we continue to increase our scale and enhance our efficiency well reinvest in our clients over time and support our growth for the long term just as weve done historically winwin monetization is about meeting more of our clients total financial needs by offering the ease and convenience of having them bring more of their financial life in one place were also able to bolster our revenue growth and our wealth business is growing the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 quickly and this is a win for clients as client promoter scores for our advice solutions are among the highest at the firm so these are our happiest clients and it is a win for us yeartodate weve attracted nearly billion in managed investing net flows a increase over last year and we see strong net flows across our spectrum of solutions and you can see the growth on this page in schwab wealth advisory in wasmer schroeder and a in schwab personalized indexing by offering our clients a broad spectrum of the wealth solutions they need were also supporting growth in our feebased revenue streams as you can see with the growth in our revenue on the right hand side of this page looking within our wealth solutions i wanted to do a bit of a deeper dive into our wasmer strategies these fixed income strategies provide clients with a wide range of tax exempt and taxable solutions clients also have access to a dedicated team of portfolio managers and portfolio personalization capabilities all at a lower cost than competitive offerings with total assets under management of billion weve seen assets in these strategies grow at a compound annual growth rate of since our acquisition in july of and have grown by nearly in the last two years where weve had a higher interest rate environment this yeartodate alone weve seen net flows of billion demonstrating that these solutions are indeed meeting client needs turning now to client segmentation at schwab we will always meet the needs of a wide spectrum of investors and ria firms but we also need to serve our distinct client segments and strong relationships are the foundation of our ability to do this when we build relationships by meeting client needs and meeting clients where they are and with the service models tailored education and the specialized capabilities they need we will retain our existing clients and attract new ones rias which are one of our key client segments we strengthen our relationships with rias of all sizes through an unparalleled offer that helps each of them grow compete and succeed for example we offer advisors turnkey asset management solutions flexible technology and highly specialized business consultant teams all at an incredible value with zero custody fees and no intention of changing that turning to our retail business high net worth retail clients are another important segment where the power of strong relationships is clear our high net worth retail investors who have a financial consultant bring in more than times the average household net new assets times the managed investing net flows and have better toa ratios and notably higher client promoter scores compared to retail high net worth clients who do not have an fc continuing to invest so we can build and expand on these valuable client relationships will help support our growth over the long term our fourth strategic focus area is the brilliant basics we know that if we can make it even easier for our clients to do business with us and if we can deliver on the basics for our clients in every interaction they have at schwab will build loyalty and our delighted clients will grow their wealth with us and refer their friends and family members to us one example of how were delivering on this for clients is the enhancements we continue to make through the bestinclass schwab mobile app we know clients and third parties like it today our mobile app has a star rating on the app store and for the second year in a row corporate insight has ranked us the number mobile app experience among brokerage firms and we continue to invest in and enhance that experience were introducing features our former ameritrade clients love like the recently launched customizable dashboard other recent and planned enhancements will simplify the client experience by reducing clicks and expanding on our customization capabilities that can influence asset gathering in the near term things like the macroeconomic environment seasonality and some behavioral differences we see in the former ameritrade client base we believe our through the cycle growth recipe remains intact over the longer term we expect will continue to see the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 to annualized ma growth from existing and new clients bolstered by delivering on our four strategic focus areas as weve shared is a transition year with strong client engagement a successful integration continued progress on our strategic focus areas and opportunities to introduce our client base to the best of schwab and ameritrade we remain wellpositioned to continue serving our growing client base and delivering profitable long term growth to stockholders with that ill turn it over to peter peter b crawford managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp well thank you very much rick so walt and rick talked about the exciting results weve already seen from the ameritrade integration and the opportunities that it enables our strong momentum in the market and the success weve enjoyed in attracting a diverse mix of clients the progress weve made and continuing to enhance our leadingvalue proposition at the same time that we continue to drive greater efficiency throughout our business and finally our commitment to continuing that journey combining ever greater efficiency with sustained investments in improving the client experience my time today ill review our solid financial performance in the second quarter and over the first half of the year ill provide some highlevel perspective on what were seeing with regard to our clients transactional cash and ill share an updated scenario for the important point is that we are proceeding through what weve described previously and what walt talked about at the outset as a transitional year but frankly at a slightly faster pace than wed anticipated just six months ago with our organic growth rebounding towards historical levels a continued moderation of client cash realignment activity despite seasonal pressures and the impact of very high investor engagement sequential growth in our net interest margin continued expense discipline with adjusted expenses basically flat yearoveryear excluding some unusual items and finally a steady increase in our capital levels both our regulatory levels and those inclusive of aoci and all of that sets the stage for what we expect will be more of a return to normal the unlocking of our core earnings power and frankly a much simpler financial story in the quarters and years ahead but one featuring strong growth in revenue and earnings in the back half of and over the next several years as walt mentioned the first half of the year has been characterized by strong equity markets increased client engagement and solid organic growth we saw that reflected in external benchmarks such as the sp and nasdaq as well as key drivers of our business performance including margin balances up from the end of trading activity up slightly from the first six months of last year and as rick mentioned a real surge in interest among clients for our advisory solutions our clients transactional cash balances are typically pressured in the first half of the year by engagement in the markets in january and february and then tax season in april and early may and that was no different in but even so we continued to see a moderation of the rate driven client cash realignment activity now that backdrop helps support solid financial performance in the second quarter with revenue up year overyear to billion adjusted expenses in  were up just under yearoveryear but that included several onetime andor unusual items without which our adjusted expenses would have been down more than with an adjusted pretax margin of roughly and adjusted eps of turning our attention to the balance sheet total assets dropped by driven primarily by taxrelated outflows and the continuation albeit at a much slower pace of the client cash realignment activity we have experienced for a little over two years and the overall level of realignment within bank sweep and schwab one in the quarter was down about versus the same quarter in now as i mentioned earlier we have seen strong growth in the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 margin utilization to start the year and to support that activity we redirected about billion of client cash from the banks to the broker dealers that caused our level of supplemental borrowing to rise slightly in the quarter but i want to emphasize again that this is a good thing we are more than happy to absorb a bit more borrowing on which were paying just over to support margin loans on which were earning just under and finally despite rates that increased slightly during the quarter our capital position continued to get even stronger with our adjusted tier leverage ratio again reminding you thats the one thats inclusive of aoci and therefore what our binding constraint would be if we lose the aoci aoci optout at schwab bank now well over and just under for the company overall meaning we are marching steadily towards our new operating objective for capital now despite the influence of typical seasonal pressure to start the year coupled with atypically bullish very bullish investor sentiment client cash balances have largely trended consistent with our expectations despite rates remaining higher than the fed and the market predicted earlier in the year and all indications support that we are in the very late innings of client cash realignment activity in fact over the course of  clientdriven outflows from bank sweep despite the seasonal tax payments have been less than the cash flow generated from our investment portfolio which in the absence of any or other actions on our part would have led to continued declines in supplemental borrowing now with new client acquisition and organic growth returning to our historical norms and all signs suggesting that the fed funds rate is likely peaked meaning in the absence of this catalyst we expect the utilization of investment cash alternatives such as purchase money funds and cds to stabilize and then eventually decrease over time we believe were nearing the point where aggregate transactional cash balances should flatten and then ultimately resume growing again now that solid start to the year lays the foundation for what we expect will be an even stronger end of the year propelling us into growth through and beyond we now expect our full year revenue to range between flat to up versus or roughly in the middle of the mathematical illustrations you may recall we shared back in january and as i shared back in may at our investor day we now expect our adjusted expenses to be approximately higher than and as a reminder about half that change from the previous guidance is due to unanticipated onetime items such as the fdic surcharge and the regulatory accrual with the remainder coming from the increase in the sec which is again as a pass through expense and therefore pl neutral but to use the transitional wording again that analyzed view masks the progression in earnings power by the end of the year were expecting flattish earnings from  to  but assuming the fed cuts rates in september as is widely expected we could see our nim reach the mid2 in  on its way to approaching by the end of which we believe will support adjusted earnings per share in the middle of the to range we outlined at the beginning of the year with our earnings power building in and beyond and despite longterm rates moving a little bit higher during the quarter our capital levels are climbing steadily and we continue to expect our consolidated adjusted tier leverage ratio to approach our slightly updated operating objective of to on a consolidated basis by the end of at which point it becomes more of a live conversation regarding whether and how we want to do further capital return our number priority for capital is always to support business growth now to the extent that we have capital in excess of what is needed to do that we have throughout our history taken steps to return that to stockholders that can be through increasing our dividend which generally rises alongside earnings that can be by redeeming outstanding preferred to create additional dry powder for the future especially preferreds that might be or might become relatively expensive and that can also be of course through stock buybacks which we do opportunistically the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 there is one additional consideration right now which is to the extent that we have outstanding supplemental borrowing we may choose to utilize some of the liquidity wed otherwise use for buybacks to reduce some of that bank level debt and doing that reduces our reliance on nonbusiness as usual funding sources and given the relatively higher cost of the supplemental borrowings its likely more accretive to earnings in the near term while preserving the capacity the ability to implement stock repurchases at a later date so by doing that we can kind of have our cake and eat it too now those of you whove followed the company for a while know that we dont tend to communicate bold longterm financial targets rather we continue to talk about our longterm financial formula a relatively simple and straightforward formula that is based on our clear and straightforward business strategy which we articulated as you know as through clients eyes and what makes that financial formula simple and straightforward is its based on a set of pretty reasonable assumptions for schwab at least around organic growth revenue growth expense containment and capital return assumptions that we have delivered through the cycle over multiple decades our last twoplus years that formula has admittedly been obscured to an extent by the impact of rising rates and what that has done to client transactional cash balances but with rates seeming to plateau and client cash realignment moderating while organic growth returns to that historical level were nearing the point where that simple and straightforward formula that simple and straightforward financial story should become more clear one that without making some big leap of faith combines strong organic growth strong profitability and substantial capital return with that ill turn it over to jeff to facilitate our qa jeff jeff edwards managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp thank you very much peter operator can you please remind everyone how they may ask a question the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 question and answer section operator operator instructions would you like me to go to the first question jeff edwards a managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp yes please operator thank you our first question comes from brian bedell from deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc well great thanks thanks thanks very much for the presentation maybe just peter can you talk about your view on how you may cut deposit rates as the fed cuts and i guess first first and foremost is your assumption in your targets based on i guess how many fed cuts are based on that and then can just maybe just talk about how you might reduce deposit your direct deposit rates and sweep and the banking deposits as the fed cuts essentially the deposit beta to that peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp sure so thanks brian so the scenario that we that i outlined is based off the fed cutting rates a single time in the rest of this year in september in terms of deposit betas i wouldnt necessarily assume that deposit betas are symmetrical if you look historically deposit betas tend to be a bit higher on the in the easing cycle than they are in a tightening cycle and so while we certainly havent made any decisions exactly about what well do with deposit rates i think thats a reasonable expectation and we also would expect that as rates come down the cost of any replacements of supplemental funding that we have to access comes down as well and wed also expect that on the margin that rate cuts would over time bring about higher levels of clients transactional cash as the incentive for them to utilize alternative solutions like purchase money funds and cds become somewhat less operator next well go to the line of ken worthington from jpmorgan please go ahead kenneth b worthington q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning and thanks for taking the question in terms of the use of thirdparty banks like td how much of your bank assets might migrate to thirdparty banks over time at sort of steady state and how would you expect the economics to compare to the fees that you currently earn on a money market fund or in the schwab bank spread over rate cycle and i guess lastly given the wells comments on friday is there risk that using thirdparty banks might risk regulators having an opinion on the yields passed on to certain end customers in the advisory or other segments of your business walter william bettinger a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 yeah so i think its early to have definitive answers on the first set of questions that you asked although if you research our ida agreement with td bank it probably gives you a good direction with respect to the economics the economics can be very attractive for us in terms of not needing to have capital relative to those deposits and thats where i would probably direct you to to look in terms of the economics of that in terms of the level we want to make sure that we maintain sufficient deposits at our bank to again fund the loans that our clients want and then have appropriate levels of liquidity over and above that with respect to the wells fargo issue we have provided money market fund sweep cash and or money market yields on bank cash for all of our fiduciarydriven investment advisory solutions already so i dont really see the wells fargo report having any kind of meaningful implications for us weve been doing this for an extended period of time already operator next well go to the line of kyle voigt from kbw please go ahead kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning just maybe on the ameritrade attrition abating and net new assets getting back to that to level as they have grown historically i guess with the knowledge of doing prior brokerage integrations albeit on a smaller scale than the ameritrade integration do you have any expectation of when you could get back into that range and typically when do you see attrition effectively fully abate after the last migration which weve obviously just went through richard a wurster a president the charles schwab corp well let me start by saying first thanks for the question kyle let me start by saying when we look at our schwab client base we continue to grow within that to organic growth rate that we target over the long term so what when you look at the company level metrics whats keeping us from the to overall is in fact behavior of the ameritrade clients and the great thing that were seeing is we are seeing a change in their behavior and its in line with what we would expect which is first we need to stop clients from leaving the firm and from ameritrade flows being negative and i think were in the process of that happening walt referenced the significant improvement in client promoter scores thats true both on the retail side and the advisor side so client promoter scores are getting higher as those client promoter scores are getting higher were moving from outflows from our ameritrade clients to inflows what we then need to do is to move a client base that hasnt had client flows quite in line with where schwab organic growth rate has been historically we need to move them from being positive contributors to net new assets to contributing at the same level as schwab as our schwab organic growth rate and the way well do that is by introducing our schwab model to ameritrade clients the financial consultant the relationship model the service the advice the consultants that we bring on the advisor side all of that we believe will help accelerate the ameritrade net new asset formation so were confident we can grow in the to range we continue to do so on the schwab side today and were right where wed expect to be in terms of the process of moving ameritrade clients from being net detractors and net new assets to now being slightly positive and then we anticipate by introducing our model to them to build and to grow them to the same level as schwab clients over time operator next well go to the line of dan fannon from jefferies please go ahead the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning peter i was hoping you could elaborate on your assumptions of whats going to drive the sequential growth really after being flat in  to  and specifically things like margin balances which are growing but as you said are drawing more shortterm funding so curious about shortterm funding levels plus some of the other assumptions in that  to  ramp peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah so we can certainly we can follow up with we have a number of assumptions on the page there and youre welcome to follow up with the ir team in terms of some of the details but broadly speaking as i mentioned previously the assumptions are as a single fed cut in in september client cash realignment activity that continues to moderate wed expect it will flatten and then again ultimately resume growth and then more of a continuation of the general relatively conventional assumptions around equity market appreciation margin balance growth that goes along with that and so forth in terms of indiscernible borrowing our carry of course is to pay that down as quickly as we can but the pace at which we pay that down is dependent on the level of margin balance growth and if we see continue to see more margin balance growth we will as we always do want to make sure we support that growth and at times that means moving some cash out of the bank some client cash out of the bank over to the broker dealer but again that is we welcome the margin balance growth its good for clients it means where our clients are engaged that we are supporting our active trader community which is a very important segment for us its a very profitable interestearning assets so were more than happy to support that even if it means that it delays to a certain extent the pay down of supplemental borrowing its accretive from a nim standpoint accretive from a net interest revenue standpoint and so forth so thats why its why its really i think id caution everyone not to focus on supplemental borrowing just in isolation in a vacuum because its influenced by other factors as well operator next well go to the line of steven chubak from wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so peter you had outlined a couple of different selfhelp levers i mean the first is the potential to migrate additional cash off balance sheet in the future i actually wanted to focus on the potential opportunity to accelerate pay downs of the highcost liabilities by repositioning the securities portfolio and was hoping you could just unpack what are some of the constraints that we should be mindful of when thinking through the potential opportunity and is it fair to assume that you would likely wait until youre at your capital target at which point you would maybe consider pursuing that path peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah so thanks thanks for the question steven so i would say i know weve gotten this question weve got this question a fair amount and our thinking on repositioning it hasnt really changed we certainly understand the benefit of that on accelerating the pay down of supplemental borrowing accelerating the net interest margin accretion earnings accretion that we expect to happen over time the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 at the same time were very cognizant of and very mindful of doing anything that would jeopardize the trust our clients place in us especially for the sake of bringing forward something that we expect will happen on its own and so thats why we havent done that so i would say its not something we by any means rule out altogether but its also not something where were looking to do in the near term operator next well go to the line of brennan hawken from ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning and thanks for taking my questions id like to follow up on the question around the shift to third party banks for as a place for deposits so just at a high level im curious if you could explain to us the strategic shift here because we spoke about it a year ago at the last what used to be the winter business update now is the investor day although i guess in it was at a different timing and there was a defense of using the bank subsidiary so what led you to shift there and then maybe just like timing wise when should we expect this to happen and how do you strike the you referenced that you want liquidity above the need to fund the loans you know how should be thinking about what the bank will actually look like once things settle out and you take this journey walter william bettinger a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp yeah thanks brennan so as i indicated were talking about years not months and quarters and we just want to foreshadow that over those period of years we think that there may be approaches that are more efficient in terms of rewarding our clients as well as rewarding our stockholders than maintaining of the deposits at our bank we want deposits as i indicated to be sufficient to cover the loans that we intend to do for our clients that provide quality yields deepen relationships and were able to do at exceptionally lowcredit risk as well as having liquidity beyond that but we all recognize that deposit flows can be very volatile depending on rate environments and we have in place one agreement already today that provides us substantial flexibility for our client deposits with exceptional economics for us without the need for capital and we think that there are other opportunities to consider expanding that again i want to emphasize through the prepared remarks i made that this is all subject to the economics of doing so but we do think there are meaningful opportunities to lighten some of the capital load over time again measured in years not months and quarters that will provide us additional flexibility and also let us extend fdic insurance to higher levels for our clients operator next well go to the line of benjamin budish from barclays please go ahead benjamin budish q analyst barclays capital inc hi good afternoon thanks for taking our questions just thinking about the sort of cash inflows over the next maybe six to eight quarters can you maybe provide an update on your expected pace of securities maturing off of the balance sheet i think youve talked before about the back half of but is there any update you could perhaps provide on what to expect in thank you the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah so i mean i think i would think about that in terms of the pace of cash flows off the investment portfolio as sort of in the billion to billion a quarter somewhere in that range of as the portfolio the size of portfolio goes down that its reasonable expect that that level of cash flow goes down as well sort of commensurate with that but sort of as a general rule of thumb over the next several quarters i think is a reasonable expectation operator next well go to the line of alex blostein from goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everybody thank you for the question well so a lot of the things were talking about for the last several quarters are related to kind of selfhelp levers and improvement in the companys earnings power ill ultimately start with improvement in the deposit trajectory of the business thatll help supplemental borrowings capital returns et cetera so maybe help us sort of refresh now that youve had the business with ameritrade for some time how are you thinking about the normalized framework for growth in schwabs deposits sweep deposits whether its a percentage of net new assets or some other metric but i guess also considering that even if we do get rate cuts the fed funds rate in the market rate is still going to be probably meaningfully higher versus kind of the available capacity of yield that you and the industry offering peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah thanks alex for the question so i know theres a lot of focus on kind of monthtomonth even at times weektoweek changes in deposit flows i think its important to maybe shed a little bit of context you know so first is deposit flows over a short period of time are influenced by net new assets of course and the cash is brought in from new accounts and then what clients do with that cash and that can be ratedriven allocations that they make to purchase money funds cds and so forth they can also be into engagement in the market equities mutual funds and so forth and so that can create some variability we have seen a strong engagement in the markets and when we look at the ratedriven activity among our clients that continues to go down the second point of context i would make which is that you do see variability in those flows from frankly from daytoday or monthtomonth and we can see billion or billion of net inflows or outflows on a particular day and so when you just look at a months numbers depending on what day of the week the month ends on it can influence the level of transactional cash that we report on on a monthly basis and id say june was sort of it was comparable to may july as you know has started off stronger its still early its about halfway through the month so well see how the month ends but it is started off definitely stronger than in terms of deposit flows than may in terms of the long term to get into your question of the long term we would expect in a stable environment that client and transactional cash grows with the growth in accounts and the growth in total assets we actually recently did a study to look at clients who opened their accounts roughly years ago and what we see over time is as those clients increase the net worth in their accounts increase assets in their accounts their cash balances go up and they actually stay at a relatively constant percent of the assets in the account and so i think as you are modeling our transactional cash over a long period of time over years i think its reasonable to expect that that transactional cash grows with the growth in assets and the growth in accounts when rates are rising that growth will be a little bit slower when rates are falling that growth will be a little bit the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 faster but i think over time in a stable environment thats a reasonable expectation over again over multiple years operator next well go to the line of bill katz from td cowen please go ahead william katz q analyst td cowen okay thank you very much for taking the question maybe a twoparter the first one is just in terms of the ameritrade metrics you mentioned in terms of ph not up to the to growth rate that youre experiencing on the legacy platform can you scale and size the two relative asset pools that were speaking to and then the broader question i have is just as youre thinking now about migrating the growth of the bank how should we be thinking about the end state of the size of the bank and does this change your capital return methodology richard a wurster a president the charles schwab corp let me start with the ameritrade part of the question we brought over about trillion of ameritrade client assets were at trillion overall so ameritrade is clearly an important part of our business looking at the longer term its important to remember the enthusiasm we have for the combination of the strength of ameritrade and schwab were talking a lot about shortterm dynamics around cash and net interest margin and things like that we have an incredible franchise that weve just spent four years putting together the best of everything ameritrade had to offer with the best of everything schwab has to offer and the behavior were seeing from our clients is exactly what we would expect we went from clients who experienced a lot of change and might have had dual relationships at ameritrade and somewhere else making the decision that this wasnt where they wanted to be and so we did see some attrition that attrition was well below what our expectations were and now were seeing what wed expect to see in the next phase which is client satisfaction from those clients that were moved who had their experience changed improving dramatically were up points in our advisor services business in terms of our overall client promoter scores following the conversion and on the retail side nine months after a client moves their satisfaction is up points so we have built a platform that both sets of clients love and now what we get to do for the long term and for the foreseeable future is deliver our mission of making a difference in our clients lives through a platform thats never been stronger on the retail side and the advisor side than it had been than it is right now today and so were confident in our longterm organic growth rate we think the behavior were seeing is exactly in line with what we would have expected and are very optimistic for our future growth operator next well go to the line of michael cyprys from morgan stanley please go ahead michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning and thanks for taking the question maybe just circling back to the wells fargo announcement maybe could you just help clarify for us the magnitude of cash that you have in fiduciary accounts the types of accounts these represent where you offer the money fund equivalent yields is it just the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 retirement only and then just more broadly how do you think about the risk over the long term that industry practices evolve with more account types over time that capture these money fund equivalent yields richard a wurster a president the charles schwab corp i just want to clarify in our fiduciary relationships where we in our managed investing programs our wealth programs cash assets are invested in a sweep government money fund so we dont have this exposure that wells fargo has operator thank you next well go to the line of chris allen from citi please go ahead chris allen q analyst citigroup global markets inc hey good morning everyone i wanted to ask about the nim outlook for just wondering what are the parameters that youre baking in to get there did this entail any of the changes that you talked about around the balance sheet strategy in terms of shortening duration as well peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah thanks chris so the approaching nim approaching by the end of the primary driver of that is again a moderation of the client transactional cash realignment activity and the paydown of the supplemental borrowing that is very very accretive to our net interest margin in terms of whether the comments that walt provided have any influence over that i just reiterate what he said which is that is something thats evolutionary not revolutionary its going to play out over multiple years and so it doesnt influence at all really the that more nearterm outlook that we have for the end of towards the end of thanks for the question okay operator next well walter william bettinger a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp operator i think we have time for one short question and then were going to close operator absolutely our final question comes from the line of devin ryan from citizens jmp please go ahead devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc oh great thanks so much for squeezing me in just got a question about lending and obviously its been an area you guys have been talking about both on the investor day and then today as well just thinking about kind of where schwab is your basis points of client assets i think you highlighted that the industry indiscernible so just would love to get some color around where you how much of that gap you think you could actually close just with your i guess suite of products number and number what youre comfortable going through in terms of the mix of the balance sheet especially just given some of the evolution of the balance sheet were talking about today as well thank you the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 walter william bettinger a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp well thanks for the question devin we certainly think we can expand our lending capabilities and the way were focused on doing that is by creating the easiest most straightforward clientfriendly process in the industry and weve seen that on within our pledged asset line program where its now days average cycle time to get our pledged asset line its actually less than a day for individual and joint accounts but our more complex ones drive up the average time of those originations are now done digitally these are major enhancements and were making other enhancements to our mortgage process to the way we lend to our higher net worth clients and the experience they have so were trying to build an experience that makes it such that our schwab clients never want to borrow somewhere else they want to borrow from us so we do think there is lots of runway to close that gap and were quite bullish on our on the opportunity here and we are in a in an interest rate environment where theres not as much borrowing as weve seen historically not as much rolling over of loans and things but we are confident that weve built the process the experience and the offer that we should be for our clients an exceptional place to borrow and that includes our industry leading rates for clients that have assets with us final comment id make is its also a terrific way to add to the service that we provide to our advisor clients our advisors for years have been asking us to do more lending because they dont want to have to introduce another into the relationship and increasingly were able to meet their needs which delights them and we think well be able to do more of that over time peter b crawford managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp all right well i think its my opportunity or my time to close you know i want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and hearing our thoughts on the business and the opportunity in front of us you know i think its very easy to focus on very nearterm tactical measures and is client cash realignment activity plus or minus billion our supplemental borrowing our net interest margin in terms of which we measure in terms of basis points and those of you who follow the company for a long time know that we manage for the long term and we have a very longterm orientation we our faith in our clients our faith in our strategy our confidence in that strategy really helps us remain focused on the long term and walt described this year at the outset as a transitional year and i think as we sit here halfway through the year we feel really good about how that transition is going in terms of our strategic positioning in terms of the completion of the ameritrade integration and the satisfaction of those clients in terms of the organic growth the capital levels and even the financial performance and we certainly recognize the journey is not over by any means but were feeling very confident about where we are and where were going and thanks everyone again and well look forward to speaking with you again in october the charles schwab corp schw
