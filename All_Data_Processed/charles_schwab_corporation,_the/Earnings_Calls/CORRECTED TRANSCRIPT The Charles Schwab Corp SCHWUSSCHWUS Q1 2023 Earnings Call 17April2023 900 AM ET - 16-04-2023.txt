management discussion section jeff edwards headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp hi jeff edwards head of investor relations and im joined today by our cochairman and ceo walt bettinger president rick wurster and cfo peter crawford before we jump into the presentation id like to touch on a few housekeeping items todays setup is obviously a little bit unique with a business update immediately following this mornings release of our strong first quarter results that being said our time here today will still be dedicated to providing you with a broad strategic update of our growing business similar to past events i will be helping facilitate qa now given recent events the team has a fair amount theyd like to share with you so dedicated qa time may end up being slightly shorter than usual therefore it is very important that we all strictly adhere to the one question no followup format that has been in place now for several quarters we also ask that you vector clarifying or more tactical questions regarding the recently reported quarter to the ir team todays slides should be available on the ir website momentarily and finally before we move on lets not forget the mighty wall of words which reminds us all that the future is uncertain so please stay in touch with our disclosures id like to turn it over to walt bettinger walter william bettinger cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17apr2023 thank you jeff and hello everyone thanks for joining us for our april business update this is important opportunity for our team at schwab to speak directly with all of you to speak with accuracy and facts and to speak with clarity and transparency we know that the past few weeks have been very challenging for longterm stockholders which of course all of our executives at schwab are also me included let me start by making a few crystal clear statements first our clients although curious and somewhat surprised about the downward movement in our stock price remained fully engaged with us and are bringing substantial assets to schwab on both the retail side and the ria advisor side we are winning in the marketplace among clients anyone suggesting otherwise is mistaken simply put our franchise strength and financial model remain very much intact second we did not and have not changed our multidecade approach to conservative conservatively managing our bank balance sheet any suggestions to the contrary of that are false and although our nearterm costs of funding are higher than recent historical levels and as a result will impact our nearterm earnings this cost is temporary and should diminish over the coming quarters and could wind down between now and the end of and third we are well into the execution of the conversion of the former ameritrade clients to schwab and as we progress through this conversion and beyond we will ultimately realize substantial expense savings well beyond the remaining million to million we originally committed to as part of the ameritrade integration synergies now looking at the first quarter it was a complex environment for investors although the equity markets overall performed quite well investor sentiment was actually quite negative throughout the quarter the fed raised interest rates another basis points while the and 10year yield on treasuries fell by basis points and basis points respectively and yet despite negative investor sentiment this wasnt reflected in our clients engagement with us clients entrusted us with over a billion in core net new assets with the monthly level increasing each of the three months of the quarter peaking with over billion in march and achieving an organic growth rate in excess of once again validating our longterm track record of growing client assets in every economic environment in addition to growth in client assets clients remained engaged with us in other areas with another quarter of over million new client accounts over million daily average trades a client promoter score or net promoter score of and almost billion moved into our investment advisory solutions lets go ahead and transition from our client results to discuss some of the corporate financial areas that have been in the press on the minds of investors and in too many cases falsely described by some competitors who have tried without much success as evidenced by our nearrecord march level of net new asset flows to scare clients into leaving schwab again our franchise and financial model are strong we have substantial liquidity we have capital well in excess of regulatory requirements and our strong profit margins deliver ongoing organic capital formation which can be used to meet future capital needs we have industryleading levels of fdic insured balances at our bank our investors bank our balance sheet and investments were and are conservatively managed and managed in a manner consistent with how we have managed our bank balance sheet for the last two decades and for our longterm stockholders we have great confidence in our ability to deliver a combination of growth and capital return just as we have for almost years the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17apr2023 so id like to go into a bit more detail now on each one of these statements ive publicly stated multiple times and in multiple formats that we cannot foresee any plausible scenario where we would have to sell securities to meet the liquidity needs of our clients and thats not an accident because we have always planned for the potential of time periods where high liquidity needs exceed our available cash of course these time periods tend to occur when the fed is raising interest rates rapidly and while this cycle of interest rate increases has been historically rapid leading clients to realign their investment cash more quickly than we had predicted our advanced planning ensured that we would have the necessary liquidity to meet their demands we prepare in part by minimizing the issuance of cds andor borrowing from the fhlb during more normal times effectively keeping that dry powder for periods of higher liquidity needs of course accessing this higher cost funding is not something we expect to be anything other than temporary currently projected to wind down over the next seven quarters and be largely gone by yearend i would certainly hope that by this point in time the shortdriven speculation that we would find ourselves in a position where we would be forced to sell securities that have temporary paper losses has been put to bed from a capital standpoint we have solid levels today well in excess of regulatory requirements now we understand the possibility that the aoci optout might well be eliminated and the questions that that raises about the potential need for capital at this point if this scenario does play out and a reasonable timeframe is afforded to build the capital to support this change we feel confident today in our ability to build the necessary capital organically given our strong profit margins even in the stressed market environment this past quarter we achieved an adjusted pretax margin of almost and even under some of the most pessimistic scenarios for the future we are at least pretax and of course our unrealized marks on certain securities decline over time and theyve also declined as interest rates have modestly moderated declines that youll see happening when you review our first quarter 10q the conservative nature of our bank management is also reflected in the very high percentage of deposits insured under the fdic limit at quarterend approximately of our bank deposits were under the fdic insured limits in addition these deposits are spread among tens of millions of investor accounts and lastly there are no groups of investors or advisors who directly influence or encourage collective behavior the ria firms whose clients hold the greatest amount of cash on our bank balance sheet account for barely of total bank deposits and the average transactional cash per account for those ria firms is less than i hope these facts remove any concerns about some sort of ordinated action potentially happening that would meaningfully impact our bank deposits this is a very important slide and id like to dive deeper into our clients cash behaviors i know this is a critical area of interest particularly as it could apply to future levels of bank balance sheet cash and client cash realignments as ive discussed in the past when interest rates are near clients tend to comingle their transactional cash and their longerterm investment cash together of course theres very little incentive during times like that to move their investment cash into solutions that offer higher yields than bank sweep but when interest rates rise we reach out to clients and suggest they consider realigning their investment cash into other solutions whatever the client sees fit whether that would be a purchase money fund purchase money market fund a cd a treasury security or other appropriate cash solution that the client is interested in and of course this has been taking place predominantly inside schwab as rates have been rising over the past year or the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17apr2023 so the rate pace and ultimate level of this realigning has a large impact on our nearterm financial results so not surprising we study it closely and we have models that estimate how it will unfold by several measures we study we believe that this cash realigning process is now slowing and getting closer to its endpoint which should then likely reverse to a stage where bank balance sheet cash begins to grow as a result of our organic net new asset growth as well as new accounts that we attract now in terms of the slide weve included a chart that goes back to and it illustrates multiple timeframes where interest rates were relatively high as well as several timeframes where interest rates were near often referred to as zero periods when we study this information on a per account basis what we see as the most accurate way to model this transactional cash per account is down to an average of approximately a level as low as we have seen in the past years and down about from the peak period during the covid pandemic from a percent standpoint transactional cash per account is at a 20year low of approximately now could it go lower yes of course but we believe it is closer than ever to finding its ending point heres why if you look at daily schwab bank cash movements a key metric for identifying trends far more important than a quarterly summary february of this year was lower than january and if we adjust for the single day after the silicon valley bank failure where cash movement was modestly elevated march was lower on a per day basis than february and through the first half of april even allowing for tax payments april is also lower than march measurably lower lastly its important to recognize that while some clients did readjust their cash allocations in response to the silicon valley bank failure by buying treasuries or cds or moving from prime money funds to treasury or government money funds we also saw a sharp increase in new cash coming into schwab consistent with being a safe port in a storm now this slide is also a particularly important one as it provides factual information around a topic that has been fraught with inaccuracies in the press and blogs alike that incredibly to me often relied on speculative information from short sellers and competitors schwab bank is a bank for investors we manage client cash at our bank conservatively and consistently we manage this cash in the same way weve managed it for the years that weve had our bank we make what we consider to be conservative loans almost exclusively to our existing investment clients now these loans are either backed by our clients securities portfolio or loans against their personal real estate this makes up about of our assets we do not make commercial loans as speculated by one of our competitors on national television the balance is invested primarily in securities and with this balance we look to manage credit risk by investing between and in securities backed by the us government or its agencies thats our approach to credit risk now lets talk about duration risk again an area that has been fraught with misinformation first let me begin by saying its important not to confuse as unfortunately some less than savvy alleged researchers and analysts have that maturity or weighted average life is not the same as duration we have many floating rate securities that have a long life but essentially zero duration and therefore do not contribute to negative marks with higher interest rates and of course offer increased yields as rates rise the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17apr2023 second we do not now and never have tried to guess future interest rate movements doing so is a fools game its like trying to guess stock market movements we dont guess and we dont try to time interest rate movements our approach is very straightforward weve historically managed our bank investment portfolio to a duration range between and years and we were approximately years as rates began to rise in mid admittedly nearer the higher end of our historic range than the lower end of fair criticism importantly our overall duration across the firms aggregate balance sheet which includes the banks and the broker dealers was about years that is it not not but years and we all know that even at years this is not low enough to avoid temporary paper losses when rates rise close to basis points in a year we just felt it was important to be transparent on where we were as this rising rate cycle began so again we did not change our historic approach during the covid pandemic contrary to some items ive read and heard we did not buy securities that would take us out of our historic duration range or even more bluntly we did not go out and load up our securities portfolio with long dated bonds during the pandemic period now it can be a fair criticism that we should have changed our twodecade approach to consistently maintaining a relatively shortterm duration bank portfolio during the covid pandemic in favor of holding primarily cash thats fair to say and if we would have known that the federal reserve was going to raise rates faster than they ever have in history in retrospect that would have been a brilliant move to make what we did do was to begin to build up higher levels of liquid cash in late2021 as transitory comments about inflation from the federal reserve waned and in early as the federal reserve began discussing increases in interest rates we increased our normal cash allocation about billion but given the pace that the federal reserve raise rates and therefore the pace of the resulting client cash realigning again in retrospect billion was not nearly enough and that led to our need to execute on our other liquidity measures i started my comments by making clear that our financial model and franchise strength are intact so the obvious question is how this manifests itself in terms of earnings growth and our ability to deliver for our stockholders its well understood that the temporary cost of higher funding from cds and fhlb loans will impact our nearterm revenue growth and earnings hopefully it is also well understood that as these borrowings are paid off that will be an accelerant to our mediumterm earnings but as client cash realigning moderates and eventually reverses and the headwinds from higher cost temporary funding sources diminishes over the next seven quarters what remains what remains is an extraordinary company we have a diverse client base spread across approximately million accounts we have a track record of delivering exceptionally strong organic asset growth in every environment we are completing the integration of the former ameritrade client base and adding worldclass trading capabilities along with approximately million new clients who will be exposed to all the additional products and services that schwab offers that were not available at ameritrade and millions of existing schwab clients will be exposed to the worldclass retail trading platforms that were previously only available to ameritrade clients and as a result of the integration process winding down along with investments that we have made in enhancing efficiency during this integration process we will be in a position to substantially reduce operating expenses again as i stated well beyond the remaining million to million we originally committed to as part of the ameritrade integration synergies its a powerful formula its a winning formula and im confident that it will be a formula that delivers for our longterm stockholders as it has since we went public in the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17apr2023 so peter let me turn it over to you to talk some more about our financial results and projections peter b crawford chief financial officer managing director the charles schwab corp well thank you very much walt so there are three key points i want you to take away from my portion of the presentation today first were navigating this extraordinary period from a position of strength with robust organic growth high level profitability strong and growing capital levels and access to significant liquidity second although the volume of client cash allocation activity has exceeded the expectations embedded in the financial scenario we shared a few months ago as walt mentioned we are seeing signs of the pace beginning to moderate and we continue to expect a resumption of deposit growth in and third our focus at schwab remains on our clients and while the various dynamics were working through create some nearterm headwinds our business continues to power ahead reinforcing our confidence about the longterm strength of our diversified model and our ability to keep delivering on our throughthecycle financial formula lets start by briefly reviewing our first quarter results which we released earlier this morning among the many advantages we have as we navigate through this period is our financial strength our sustained earnings power there has been so much attention to the balance sheet and dynamics influencing net interest revenue that it feels like some have lost sight of the fact that nearly of our revenue comes from other sources such as asset management fees and trading and while the remaining half is generated through net interest revenue roughly onethird of our interestearning assets are floating rate meaning the yield on those assets has increased dramatically in the last months that diversified allweather revenue model is reflected in our strong  financial performance during which we grew revenue by versus the first quarter of we grew adjusted earnings per share by and we delivered an adjusted pretax margin of nearly a level nearly unsurpassed in the financial services industry turning to the balance sheet the evolution of our balance sheet during the quarter reflected continued client cash realignment we supported this by utilizing temporary funding sources including issuing more cds and securing additional advances from the fhlb our usage of these was frontloaded and increased modestly by our decision consistent with our conservative management approach to build extra liquidity within our banks almost doubling the amount of cash on hand in the month of march we also opted to suspend our buybacks during the quarter and our strong earning supported organic capital formation which allowed us to maintain our tier leverage ratio at well above the regulatory minimum i know theres been much written wed argue too much written about the tangible common equity ratios our banking subsidiaries but those ratios have all increased significantly from the levels due to both a billion reduction in the unrealized marktomarket losses and continued strong capital formation those of you who followed the company for a while know that we have a longterm orientation executing a strategy and business model that has delivered for clients and stockholders for multiple decades i want to emphasize that the current challenges were facing are quite manageable and the impact on our financial performance is near term which means that schwabs longterm financial model of growth plus capital return remains firmly intact the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17apr2023 though as we have discussed there are some early signs of moderation of the client cash allocation activity the overall level to start the year has exceeded the assumptions incorporated within the scenarios shared at winter business update that means weve utilized a higher level of supplemental funding with the vast majority of that now expected to be paid off by the end of this temporary emphasis temporary mix shift toward higher cost of funds is expected to pressure the next few quarters of revenue at which point the impacts should start to decrease reverse and we now expect  revenue to be down a mid to uppersingledigit percent versus the second quarter of but itll have very minimal impact on our longterm financial performance with our nim and net interest margin still poised to increase throughout and approach by the end of even if rates fall from current levels as the market anticipates now its important i think to put that nim outlook into perspective as i mentioned earlier net interest revenue only accounts for half of our revenue and with an adjusted pretax margin well in the upper we can continue to produce margins that would be the envy of most other financial services firms even as we navigate these dynamics and remember that as all this has been happening we have been adding clients adding net new assets increasing the adoption of advice and lending and moving forward on the ameritrade integration now regarding expenses disciplined expense management has been a hallmark of our financial formula and throughout our history we have taken steps to pull back on our spending when were facing environmental headwinds without sacrificing the client experience or undermining longterm growth as walt said earlier we feel very confident about our ability to deliver over million of expense synergies by the end of as we complete the integration of ameritrade and as we do so its also a good opportunity for us to take a step back and examine our overall spending levels to look for additional efficiencies as we continue our decadeslong focus on driving down our expense on client assets or eoca which we view as a key competitive advantage and finally our capital ratios our capital position our capital ratios remained very strong as walt noted in his remarks even if we have to eventually absorb aoci into our regulatory capital ratios we see a clear path organically for our tier leverage ratio inclusive of aoci to exceed within the next year and cross by the end of even if rates stay flat thanks to our strong earnings a reduction in balance sheet assets even after deposit growth rebounds as we pay off the supplemental funding and the continued reduction of our aoci as our securities portfolio matures and i note that again even if rates remain flat wed expect those marktomarket losses to decrease by a further billion between now and the end of and obviously more if rates fall as the market is expecting putting all together were not blind to the nearterm dynamics were navigating but were very confident that our financial formula will reassert itself as we emerge from this period and that formula of course starts with taking care of clients growing accounts and assets deepening relationships building our capabilities expanding our moat that is what builds longterm earnings power and will be the driver of performance for our stockholders over time and to tell you more about the strength of our franchise and how were continuing to serve our clients its my pleasure to turn it over to rick the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17apr2023 richard a wurster president the charles schwab corp thank you peter and hello everyone in the winter business update i described how well schwab is positioned to sustain an organic growth rate of to over the long term through a combination of growth from existing clients attracting new clients and growth from our strategic initiatives first quarter was a great example of this as we grew net new assets by over as i share with you our business results id like to leave you with three takeaways first our business is thriving and we again delivered strong organic client growth second through the volatility in march we saw an increase in net new assets in client engagement and asset flows at the bank remained steady we emerged from the crisis not weaker but stronger third our strategic initiatives are paying off and lots of opportunity remains lets dive into the results in more detail to put it simply we are winning across all fronts were winning with existing clients with new clients and on both the retail and ria sides of our business within investor services we attracted billion in core net new assets in addition we saw an yearoveryear increase in high net worth net new assets in the quarter our no trade offs approach continues to attract clients and engender trust from our existing clients and that was particularly true in a period of uncertainty as i mentioned in our winter business update our client base continues to get younger with of newtofirm households under this quarter this is notable because when an average age under our clients are still accumulating assets within advisor services we had an outstanding quarter of growth with billion in core net new assets when the going got tough in march our growth accelerated with billion in ma in march alone in advisor services in periods of uncertainty and heightened volatility advisors win they win because they are trusted fiduciaries with clients best interests in mind and we win because we are the trusted partner of rias and partner with them to deliver for clients in all environments our toa ratio remained high and was in excess of for the quarter were committed to helping rias of all sizes grow by delivering the leading custody platform with no fees alongside practice management support industry advocacy and relationship support rias can count on there are no tradeoffs in summary our business is thriving our no tradeoffs approach was recognized by the industry the thirdparty accolades you see on the screen speak to the way we serve our clients each and every day we were recognized by investors business daily as the number one online retail broker overall by jd power as the number one full service broker and for the sixth consecutive year schwab was named one of fortune magazines top worlds most admired companies id like to turn now to our strategic initiatives of scale and efficiency winwin monetization and client segmentation were continuing to advance these initiatives within our strategic focus areas and as i mentioned these are paying off with tangible wins in the first quarter of this year let me start with scale and efficiency integration remains our top priority we successfully completed our first client transition group in february bringing over around client accounts including a small number of advisors service teams achieved an average speedtoanswer of just six seconds during the conversion a good indication of how seamlessly the transition went after years of preparation we remain on track to bring over million clients this year representing of ameritrade clients with the remaining our most active traders coming over in and as walt mentioned earlier were on track to achieve billion to billion in run rate expense synergies by the end of the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17apr2023 most important is the client benefit we see in retail clients will benefit from the combination of our modern wealth management platform alongside the leading trading and education platform in the industry for advisors we will add indiscernible capabilities advisors love to an offer that as it stands as no tradeoffs turning now to winwin monetization one of our priorities is growing our wealth business wealth is an area in which we delight clients as the client promoter scores of wealth clients are typically the highest at schwab our clients are increasingly asking for help and advice providing us with a growth opportunity and wealth offers a diversifying source of economics to us as a business weve been investing heavily to deliver for clients and accelerate our growth and we saw meaningful progress in the first quarter net flows into the wasmer schroeder strategies were billion and assets under management surpassed billion this is a clear example of a winwin opportunity for clients in schwab the offer brought down the cost of access to fixed income managed accounts on schwabs platform and interest from clients has been strong as wasmer represented the majority of net flows into fixed income managed accounts we launched several key enhancements to schwab personalized indexing including more customization and digital capabilities retail clients who work with schwab fc can now exclude more individual stocks as well as entire industries and sub industries from their portfolios we also launched a digital dashboard for retail clients that shows a realtime view of their account value and highlights clearly the value of taxloss harvesting and clients continue to turn to schwab for advice during market volatility schwab wealth advisory had billion in net flows in the first quarter the highest quarter of net flows in the history of the offer as both schwab and ameritrade clients increasingly find the offer attractive finally we continue to meet the specific needs of our client segments we are launching this year schwab private client services and schwab private wealth services for our high net worth and ultrahigh net worth clients we are winning with this client segment today and the differentiated service support and offering will further add to our no tradeoffs experience for this client segment our worldclass trader offering remains unparalleled in the industry weve released new features on thinkorswim while preparing to convert thinkorswim clients and preparing to make the offer available to schwab clients this year another key priority in this focus area is to provide tailored solutions and experiences for rias of all sizes in the first quarter we acquired family wealth alliance a membership organization that provides resources to the family wealth community serving ultrahigh net worth clients the acquisition continues the relationship that has existed between the two companies for years and together will be able to expand the services we offer for multi family offices and singlefamily offices we are thriving and our growth initiatives are paying off i shared in the winter business update some of the statistics you see on the left side of this page they show we have lots of opportunity in front of us we remain confident we can close the share of wallet opportunity i described by introducing clients to the collective capabilities of our integrated firm we also believe we can accelerate the growth of our wealth business both at schwab and by introducing it to ameritrade clients we saw very positive signs this quarter as it was our strongest quarter flows ever in the full service wealth solutions and of eligible ameritrade fcs enrolled their client into our wealth solution a very promising sign for the future we continue to invest in our lending platform to increasingly be there for clients in the future and finally the combination with ameritrade allows us to enhance our trading capabilities for a highly engaged and important the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17apr2023 client segment investing in the thinkorswim platform and bringing the powerful platform tools and education to our trader clients will be an important differentiator for schwab as we look to the future id like to wrap up where i started we are in a position of strength our business thrived in the first quarter and our growth accelerated through the recent market volatility the virtuous cycle will continue to help us sustain our attractive organic nna growth from both new and existing clients were continuing to execute on our key strategic focus areas of scale and efficiency winwin monetization and client segmentation we saw meaningful impact from some of those initiatives in the first quarter while other initiatives will help accelerate the growth of our business into the future we are delivering wins for clients and the firm each quarter the future is bright with that i will turn it over to jeff for qa jeff edwards headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp operator lets turn to the queue and please remind everyone how they can ask a question if theyd like question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question is from dan fannon with jefferies you may go ahead daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning a lot of debate that this cycle has raised the client awareness for cash and given the ease of access and movement today the historical cash allocations are likely to be different going forward so as you look over the long term how do you think about sweep cash in the percentages and how that may be different than what weve seen historically walter william bettinger a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp thanks dan im going to go ahead and comment on this so i think when you look at client cash realigning we feel fairly confident that the metrics weve shown have good basis in history i guess i would encourage you to think of a client cash aligning its an event its not a process and im going to illustrate that by an example if you have a retail client that has say build up in cash during the pandemic period and they look at that and say well i want to keep of that liquid in available for immediate trading or other uses paying bills they dont take that and say well im going to move this quarter and next quarter and then several quarters in the future its an event they reinvest the and so what you generally will see is youll see a rapid acceleration of client cash realigning early in the process of rate rise lets call it in the first year and then you begin to see it go the other way and we think as it goes the other way it goes the other way in a relatively accelerating manner because again the event has occurred the client in my example has moved their entire so we understand the question we think that the cash as we indicated the cash realigning process is slowing we are very the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17apr2023 encouraged by what we see in april with measurable slowing again were looking at three consecutive months of declines and we feel very good about the chart and the results were able to share with you operator and does that conclude your questions mr fannon daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc yes thank you operator thank you the next question is from rich repetto with piper sandler you may go ahead richard henry repetto q analyst piper sandler co yeah good morning walt and peter and first thank you for doing the timely call and at least i hope you consider this format going forward but i guess my question is sort of related to the first question there was we about calculate billion i guess in decline in balance sheet cash or uninvested sweep cash so and helped by the organic flows in march that you talked about but my question is and your terminology has changed a little bit i think but anyway do we still expect to decline in the average interestearning assets peter and thats factoring sort of this protection of aoci does that factor into if youre even at all trying to keep aware of that or manage that risk so yeah the to average interestearning asset decline by december versus december peter b crawford a chief financial officer managing director the charles schwab corp thanks rich for your question so yes we still do think that to decline in interestearning assets is the right way to think about it the way that we fund those assets may be a bit different than what we had anticipated when we shared at the winter business update but the overall asset decline is a function of the assets rolling off and that sort of the the gradual rolloff of our securities portfolio operator thank you the next question is from alex blostein with goldman sachs you may go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi good morning thanks everybody i was hoping we can doubleclick on some of your capital management comments it sounds like if you were to start to include aoci changes in capital you expect that to be a bit of an organic build and you provided some set of stats around that why not sell a significant chunk of the securities portfolio i understand it will crystallize the loss but your tier leverage actually will not move significantly when you do that so help us think through maybe some puts and takes from doing something like that taking the loss but also at the same time significantly enhancing the firms earnings power since billionplus of that securities book is massively underwater peter b crawford a chief financial officer managing director the charles schwab corp the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17apr2023 thanks for the question so i guess i would say couple things certainly you are right that if we were to sell the securities a meaningful portion of our securities portfolio it would actually be accretive to our capital levels if you included that or certainly accretive to our tangible capital levels weve said multiple times that we see no reason no need to be forced to sell securities given the strong the ample access to liquidity and the nature of our deposit base and so forth beyond that just dont really want to speculate or sort of talk in hypotheticals about the conditions under which we would sell that securities portfolio i would just would say that we see no need to do so but of course were always going to be thinking about whats the right thing for stockholders but we see no reason to do so and certainly wont do it right now given sort of the some of the volatility if you will in the market around firms that have made that decision operator thank you the next question is from ken worthington of jpmorgan you may go ahead kenneth b worthington q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning thanks for taking the question you broke the bda investments i think in the thirdparty bdas this quarter with bda balances down billion in and floating rate securities down to billion in the quarter do you foresee having to break the tdmanaged bda investments if so is this a charge that you would be responsible for and what do you foresee as the charges needed to maintain this program given your outlook for sorting this year jeff edwards a headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp hey ken its jeff obviously theres a lot of nuance with that question and just kind of in the interest of time why dont we circle up kind of offline and we can walk through kind of whats available there in all the public disclosures so ill give you a chance if you have one other question you want to touch on operator thank you the next question is from brian bedell with deutsche bank you may go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks thanks for taking my question peter if you could just comment on the pace of the wholesale borrowing if we are seeing the cash sorting flow throughout the year why not wind that down more quickly instead of having that conclude more in it seems like if you were in a position where the balance sheet will start growing again later in the year you would be in a position between the organic growth of cash coming in from the securities portfolios and cash growth from clients that you could potentially wind most of that down certainly by yearend or at the beginning of any comment on the pace of that peter b crawford a chief financial officer managing director the charles schwab corp sure so some of the certainly the cds that we issue are termed out so its not like we can recall those necessarily and the fhlb advances have different terms but as i mentioned the decision to build up cash in march meant that we frontloaded some of that activity so of course as we see the pace of this client realignment slow very reasonable to expect that of course we will initiate less advances and let those advances that we have roll off and so absolutely we could see this roll off very very quickly even as we start to see a resumption of deposit growth over the course of latter part of and then into the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17apr2023 and so i mean the key point on these advances is these are limited and theyre temporary this is not something that is going to be part of our longterm financial picture and we will certainly pay them off as quickly as we can operator thank you the next question is from mike cyprys with morgan stanley you may go ahead michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you good morning thanks for taking the question i wanted to circle back walt to your commentary around the ability to deliver substantial expense savings beyond the million to million or so i was just hoping you might be able to help quantify how meaningful that could be is that billion is that billion maybe you can expand on where thats coming from what are some of the actions that you guys might be able to take to hit that and how do you ensure this doesnt hit the overall growth and customer and in overall assets walter william bettinger a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp yeah thanks mike so i dont think at this point were going to quantify the extent that we believe that we can generate ongoing expense saves beyond the million to million that we have committed to and have remaining in the integration but we think it is substantial and yeah its important to keep in mind that as we approach this integration one of the decisions we made was that getting the integration right was our number one priority and therefore we were willing to spend quite aggressively along the way to ensure that there was nothing that got in the way of ensuring the integration went as well as smoothly as it could possibly go even if it meant ratcheting up spending to a level that was much higher than maybe we would have thought several years ago so we have the opportunities that i mentioned and then we have the opportunity after multiple years of allowing spending to grow relatively quickly to do a step back and evaluate it overall and our early work gives us the confidence to say that it is meaningfully higher than the remaining synergies but i dont think were ready to quantify it yet the one thing i will make clear though is as we have done in the past when we made moves around expense that were significant we will protect the client experience so we will not be looking at impacting the parts of the organization that build relationships with clients that serve clients and that deliver that client experience operator thank you the next question is from bill katz with credit suisse you may go ahead bill katz q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc okay thank you very much for taking the question and also appreciate you tightening up the window between this and the earnings super helpful walt or peter just a question as you think about lessons learned from this cycle versus prior cycles and i appreciate youre consistently running the franchise but should we be assuming a higher core deposit beta all else being equal to avoid these kinds of dynamics weve all experienced in the last month or so and on the other side on the earning asset side would you envision running a more liquid earning asset strategy all those being equal thank you the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17apr2023 peter b crawford a chief financial officer managing director the charles schwab corp yeah so thanks thanks for the question bill so in terms of the deposit pricing if you will i mean our philosophy on that hasnt changed right our clients keep as we know from history that our clients have sort of two buckets of cash their transactional cash and their investment cash and our philosophy on the transactional cash is to offer a rate that is very competitive certainly today at basis points its a lot better than what clients can earn in their checking accounts that most of the traditional banks and then to offer our clients a range of options for their investment cash that are in many cases industry leading whether thats access to treasuries or our brokerage cds or purchase money funds or whatever it might be and what weve seen is and thats served us well for multiple decades and whether we pay basis points or basis points or basis points for that transactional cash doesnt make makes very very little have very very little influence on client behavior so i dont necessarily see that aspect of our philosophy changing peter b crawford a chief financial officer managing director the charles schwab corp of course well as we always do well learn from the experience from what we learned about client behavior well have to take into consideration potential regulatory changes and well adapt and but i have every confidence that well thrive as we have every time weve faced changes around us previously whether it was when the dotcom bubble burst in or whether it was when we launched the bank and came under fed supervision or went to zero commissions and in every single situation we adapted and we came out the other end even stronger and we were going into it not because as walt ad rick have talked about we stay focused on our clients and doing right by our clients and if we do that everything else will take care of itself walter william bettinger a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp great and operator i think we have time for one last question operator thank you our last question is from ben budish with barclays you may go ahead benjamin budish q analyst barclays capital inc hey guys thanks so much for squeezing me in here i just wanted to ask kind of about your approach to buybacks you mentioned earlier in the call that you had suspended them for the meantime what are the sort of data points youre looking at or indicators that would cause you to get more positive and feel comfortable resuming there peter b crawford a chief financial officer managing director the charles schwab corp yeah thanks ben i think what we would like to see a little bit more clarity on the regulatory front and whats going to happen with how capital is treated and a timeline there as i said we feel very confident in our ability to build into the potential inclusion of aoci into our regulatory capital ratios but wed like to see a little bit more clarity there before we would i think strongly consider or look to resume the buybacks of course our buybacks are always opportunistic not programmatic as weve said multiple times but i think thats probably the one of the key points we want to wait for the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17apr2023 jeff edwards a headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp well turn it over to walt to close this out today walter william bettinger cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp thanks jeff and thanks everyone for joining in and participating and thanks for the feedback on the timing of this update relative to our earnings report and please continue to provide that feedback and well be look to be responsive to excuse me to what we hear from all of you around the best and the best time to do these updates i think as all of you know ive been doing this a long time this is this is my 15th year as ceo of schwab and during that time ive seen a lot of different environments some good as well as much more difficult ones but when i look at that history whats consistent to me is that longterm success comes from maintaining a focus on clients there are always going to be circumstances that come up on a periodic basis that have more of a short term impact and were well aware were not oblivious to whats going on we also know that we have driven much of what has gone on that has affected our nearterm earnings because weve been proactively reaching out to our clients of all sizes for the last year and explaining to them the options that they should consider with their investment of cash but again id like to put this in the context of what i led with around clients its the right thing to do and its what we would do during this environment if were faced with this environment again were well aware that longterm success comes from a focus on clients and were well aware that our bank is unique as it serves as a bank for investors were also well aware that as storms come storms also go eventually they come to an end and what we know from history is that when those storms end the firms who stand tall are those who have a focus on clients and thats something that i believe you can count on for schwab as you have for many years in the past and can count on again in the future thanks again for all of your time today we very much appreciate it and we appreciate the thoughtful questions operator thank you that concludes todays conference thank you all for participating you may disconnect at this time the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call
