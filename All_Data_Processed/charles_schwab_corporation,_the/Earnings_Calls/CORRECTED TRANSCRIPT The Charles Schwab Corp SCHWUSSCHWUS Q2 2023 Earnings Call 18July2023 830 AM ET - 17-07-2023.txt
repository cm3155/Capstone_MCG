management discussion section jeff edwards headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp and here we go good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for the schwab summer business update we certainly werent going to let a little searing texas heatwave get in the way of providing you with a strategic update on our business this is jeff edwards head of investor relations and ill be followed very shortly by our esteemed presenters cochairman and ceo walt bettinger president rick wurster and cfo peter crawford before we kick off lets briefly hit on a few housekeeping items similar to past events ill be helping facilitate qa and we are still abiding by the one question no followup format we also ask that you save any clarifying or reconciling questions regarding this mornings reported quarter for the ir team todays slides will be posted to the ir website at the beginning of peters remarks okay before we get on to the interesting stuff lets start by everyones favorite slide our forwardlooking statements page which reminds us all that the future is inherently uncertain so please stay uptodate with our disclosures and with that walt please take it away walter william bettinger cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp thank you jeff and good morning everyone im looking forward to another tripledigit day here in texas its a beautiful day but it definitely will be a scorcher a number of years ago i used an illustration that seemed timely to resurrect when my office used to be in downtown san francisco i would often look out toward treasure island early in the morning only to see dense fog and the fog would not only mask the beauty of treasure island it would often be so dense that you couldnt even see the island out in the bay in fact if you didnt know it was there you might not even realize treasure island even existed in some ways it seems to me that the fog has settled in again just as it did a few years ago and that fog is clouding how some see charles schwab today years ago the fog represented the extended period of zir or zero interest rates today the fog represents the shortterm challenges brought on by the nearrecord pace of interest rate increase by the federal reserve but as we all know the fog clouding treasure island ultimately lifts and the beauty of treasure island becomes clear and of course treasure island represents charles schwab some look at the fog and only see fog some look at the fog and know what is temporarily hidden by it and recognize how that fog is currently masking the extraordinary progress we are making as a firm those who know what is hidden by the fog recognize our ongoing organic growth and market share gains successful execution and integration of the largest brokerage combination in history ideal positioning with leadership positions in the two fastestgrowing areas of investment services thats serving registered investment advisors and serving independentminded audio gap the lowcost provider today and poised to widen this advantage over the next to months an exceptional profitability even in the most challenging of times todays presentations and discussions are intended to help more people understand the fog as well as what is hidden by the fog so thanks a lot for following along the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 18jul2023 although still somewhat uneven the second quarter began to show some signs of an improving economic and investing environment inflation began to moderate and well the fed paused its record pace of interest rate increases at least for the month of june as equity market volatility fell overall equity markets performed reasonably well but it was an exceptionally narrow market with just a handful or two of largecap growth companies accounting for a significant percentage of the solid performance investors took note and as you can see investor sentiment turned positive by the end of the quarter our investor clients remained relatively active in the markets making over million trades per day and with purchases exceeding sales by about yeartodate our clients have entrusted us with over billion in net new assets a strong number given the tax month of april falls in the first half of the year and a level of net new assets consistent with our longterm historical trend of net new assets between and of our total asset base in addition clients have opened approximately million new accounts yeartodate key client metrics continue to be solid in retail our speed to answer phone calls averaged under seconds and this is a particularly important metric as we transitioned millions of former ameritrade clients over to schwab during the first half of the year advisory flows in retail were also solid at over billion in advisor services we continued to be the destination of choice for breakaway brokers and broker teams of all sizes yeartodate weve assisted almost teams moving over to independents with schwab as their primary custodian and the average advisor manages about million who converted to independents of course these nearterm metrics are important but the longterm success of schwab is even more important and revealing we have a distinctive set of competitive advantages built over multiple decades that enable us to serve clients in a better way while at the same time rewarding our stockholders our advantages revolve around our size and scale our operating efficiency service culture operating structure reputation and willingness to be disruptive these six advantages help us to execute on our through clients eyes strategy which has resulted in a dramatic increase in market share over the past decade as weve meaningfully grown our market share of client assets by multiples of our key competitors at independent brokerdealers as well as wirehouses this change in market share is more than simply numbers on a page it represents millions of clients and hundreds of billions of dollars of client assets proactively choosing schwab and in doing so getting a better deal than what they traditionally experienced and while our scale and efficiency has positioned us as the low cost provider for many years we are ready to widen that gap meaningfully in the next months as we reap the efficiency and automation benefits of the ameritrade integration we anticipate the realization of expense savings to be substantial in addition to the remaining million of synergy savings that we originally committed to as part of the ameritrade acquisition we now anticipate achieving at least an additional million in future expense savings these savings will come from a variety of areas real estate savings lower head count from efficiencies gained via automation built and implemented as part of the integration work streamlining our organization to ensure we are set up to operate most efficiently postintegration and the removal of temporary expenses that were associated with the integration that we added to ensure a smooth and thoughtful process for our clients and rick before i turn it over to you to discuss in more depth where we stand with our integration process and the ongoing success were seeing with existing clients and new prospects i wanted to simply reinforce the strength of our firm the successful track record we have built up over decades continues the competitive the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 18jul2023 advantages we have built continue and im quite confident that the fog temporarily shrouding our firm will lift and sunny days will return in the coming quarters rick richard a wurster president the charles schwab corp thank you walt and hello everyone our efforts remain squarely focused on our three strategic areas scale and efficiency winwin monetization and client segmentation in our time today ill highlight the progress weve made in each focus area and talk through the opportunities that we see ahead starting with scale and efficiency integration has been and remains our number one priority over memorial day weekend we completed the largest brokerage conversion in the industry moving more than million client accounts from ameritrade to schwab thanks to the dedication of an incredible team the conversion was a success no material issues occurred despite the fact we migrated times more clients than our previous february conversion weekend client engagement has been strong with million clients logging into schwab within the first week following the conversion weekend in fact schwabs second largest market open occurred with no issues on a tuesday immediately following memorial day and by the end of the day on that tuesday our service levels had returned to normal with us answering calls at an average of seconds just a day after the conversion more broadly client and asset attrition within our conversion groups have been below expectations while we are still in the middle of what has been a successful client conversion we remain laser focused on seeing it through to completion in the months ahead we are on track to migrate the remaining ameritrade clients in three additional transition groups in september november and in the first half of one of the exciting parts of our conversion is the combined capabilities for our clients whether they are a retail client or an advisor client and id like to start by sharing the benefits on the retail side weve invested in our web and mobile experiences at schwab to ensure we have the best of the features and functionalities of both firms our former ameritrade clients will have access to the full spectrum of portfolio and wealth management solutions that we have had at schwab ameritrade clients will also be able to access our banking capabilities our branch network experience and our exceptional client service the branch network experience includes providing access to planning and wealth management capabilities that were not a focus of ameritrade we believe that will help ameritrade clients consolidate at schwab rather than rely upon a second firm now let me discuss the benefits to schwabs retail clients one of the biggest enhancements for existing schwab clients will come when we make thinkorswim available to them later this year thinkorswim is one of the crown jewels of ameritrade and its widely considered to be the premier trading platform in the market today with its unique combination of powerful tools and dedicated service from experienced trading professionals alongside education for all levels of experience and all retail clients will have this at our competitive pricing representing our true no tradeoffs approach the same is true for our ria clients ameritrade advisors will migrate to schwab over the september conversion weekend but they already have access to meaningful aspects of our ria experience ameritrade advisors already participate in our flagship industry events including impact theyve started to benefit from our leading the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 18jul2023 business consulting offer including participating in our annual benchmarking study and the executive leadership program and weve included them in our ria industry advocacy programs while also giving them access to resources like our strategy desk which educates advisors on how to use various options strategies through one onone consultations as well as our block desk which helps advisors to optimize their best execution process and as we look to labor day weekend preparations for conversion are well underway and advisors are engaged of firms who only custody with ameritrade have already begun to credentialize themselves over veo one users have accessed schwab advisor center to test drive our platform over firms to date have attended at least one educational webinar session and we are spending the summer helping firms get familiar with our technology our investment offerings and our people so they are ready to do business at schwab after labor day weekend and after conversion all advisors will enjoy the full benefits of our combined offer a custodial platform that is designed to help rias of all sizes grow and succeed schwab advisors will benefit from awardwinning platforms and capabilities like thinkpipes irebal and for model market center technology and schwab advisor center will incorporate veo ones most popular features and functionality ameritrade advisors will have access to the breadth of schwabs offer including schwab charitable and schwab bank we believe there will never have been a stronger custodial offer in the market than coming out of the conversion weekend turning now to winwin monetization clients are continuing to come to schwab for advice and weve seen strong flows in our fullservice wealth programs and our managed investing solutions schwab wealth advisory had billion in net flows for the first half of an increase of compared to last year and notably some of these inflows are being driven by a meaningful increase in flows from existing advisory clients which combined with a strong client promoter score demonstrates the value clients see in the offer it is also worth noting that of flows into schwab wealth advisory in the first half of the year were from ameritrade fcs validating our belief that there is a large untapped demand among ameritrade clients for more help and advice a significant asset and retention opportunity which we are excited to capture in the years ahead client interest in the wasmer schroeder strategies continues to be strong with billion in net flows for the first half of the year in just a few years wasmer schroeder strategies have gone from to of our managed account solutions assets at schwab this clearly demonstrates our ability to drive winwin monetization as clients have benefited from lowercost fixed income strategies than they had previously and we are benefiting from outsized flows in fixed income ameritrade clients migrating to schwab are showing appetite for our advice offers when we look at net flows into our managed investing solutions yeartodate more than million came from legacy ameritrade clients after they migrated to schwab finally we continue to build on our schwab personalized indexing offer in june we rolled out a new digital experience for our ria clients and gave them more flexibility to tailor their clients schwab personalized indexing portfolios advisors are also now able to digitally onboard their clients into our direct indexing offer and have access to a new digital dashboard that highlights the performance of each account turning now to client segmentation just last week we launched two new branded client experiences to meet the unique needs of our retail selfdirected clients with more than million and those with more than million in assets the new experience for clients with million to million is called schwab private client services and the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 18jul2023 the experience for our million plus clients is schwab private wealth services our goal is to meet the needs of these clients across several key dimensions relationships service operations product and price the differentiated experiences will include access to a dedicated schwab consultant who can help them manage their financial life access to dedicated service teams access to a range of wealth management specialists discounted mortgage pricing special client events and more our high net worth clients already represent more than twothirds of our retail client assets and as you can see on this page they also represent the areas where we have the greatest growth potential as these are our fastestgrowing retail segments meeting the needs of key client segments as we are doing with these new experiences will continue to support our longterm asset growth weve spent quite a bit of time in this forum talking about the opportunities for growth that we see ahead ive described in some detail how our strengths have positioned schwab to sustain an organic growth rate of to over the long term by attracting new assets from existing clients and attracting new clients to schwab these strengths include a client base that is in the peak of wealth accumulation dedicated relationships our commitment to ria growth our brand our acquisition model and our workplace pipeline as walt shared earlier our yeartodate organic growth rate remains in this consistent range north of and we are wellpositioned for this to continue as weve shared in prior quarters we have an attractive billion to billion revenue opportunity ahead in wealth management as we increase advice penetration among retail clients and grow our lending offer for all clients ill wrap up where walt started our through clients eyes strategy remains our northstar with clients at the forefront of every decision we make we are successfully delivering on a historic integration while making progress on our strategic focus areas at the same time were adhering to the financial discipline that is the hallmark of our allweather business model by identifying opportunities for cost savings and efficiencies that will allow us to reinvest in our clients and reward our stockholders with this approach we are on track to harness the tremendous longterm growth opportunities that lie ahead and with that i will turn it over to peter peter b crawford managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp thank you very much rick so walt and rick talked about how our through clients eyes strategy continues to power strong client growth enabling us to take significant share within the wealth management category the progress were making with the ameritrade acquisition and integration and our excitement about what the combination means for our clients and our stockholders our plans to further our industry leading cost advantage both through the remaining ameritrade integration efforts and other expense reduction actions and how were continuing to advance our broader strategic agenda in my time today ill talk about how our second quarter financial performance which was down from the very high bar we set in due largely to temporary factors also provide an update on the slowing pace of cash realignment activity a trend which reinforces our confidence that were already past peak usage of temporary supplemental funding and as the amount of that higher cost funding decreases our core earnings power will be unlocked and finally ill share an updated outlook for and some early thoughts on certain aspects of which we expect will reflect a continued return to normal for the company now what i believe should become clear is that while our nearterm financial performance has been impacted by client cash allocation activity activity that we have supported and even encouraged that activity is moderating as the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 18jul2023 one would expect which means that the potential trajectory of our longerterm financial performance should be getting increasingly clear and as it does so you should see the benefit of our continued growth our tireless drive for greater efficiency and the resilience of our diversified business model as walt mentioned despite the volatile environment and somewhat more muted investor sentiment we have continued to drive healthy organic growth throughout now if you look at our financial performance in isolation youd say it was a very strong quarter nearly billion of revenue and adjusted pretax margin of well over and over on a gaap basis our 33rd straight quarter over and of adjusted eps but relative to second quarter of last year of course revenue and earnings were lower and this is almost entirely the consequence of client cash allocation activity which has led to lower interestearning assets and greater usage of higher cost supplemental funding primarily cds and fhlb which we have utilized to support this activity utilization which is temporary in nature and therefore is not expected to weigh on our longterm financial performance and in fact assuming stable client engagement we believe our net interest margin this past quarter should represent a trough for the year speaking of interestearning assets or assets in general bank deposits were down sequentially due to client cash allocation decisions but we saw a significant decrease in the pace of that activity from april to may and then may to june our liquidity position remains quite strong and our capital position continues to get even stronger with our consolidated tier leverage ratio rising to and what were calling here are our adjusted tier leverage ratio which is inclusive of aoci and therefore what our binding constraint would be if we lose the aoci optout that ratio at our three banking subsidiaries all topping by the end of the quarter again those arent our regulatory capital ratios yet but we expect they will be at some point in the future and you can see were well on our way to meeting those new regulatory requirements well ahead of the likely deadline we shared in our last smart report the dramatic reduction in the pace of client cash allocation activity from april to may and in june we saw a further slowing in the pace of deposit flows and the reduction would have been even more significant were it not for a large reversal in client equity allocations from sales in may to net purchases in june now that broader trend is encouraging but not surprising and its reinforced by specific data points we see when we look under the hood were seeing fewer and fewer individuals making their initial purchase of an investment cash solution a purchase money fund or cd or treasury security and since the clients with larger cash balances moved first again not surprisingly the average size of those initial purchases has also come down and this is really important in june we also saw a net deposit increase for our advisor services business and thats significant because in this and in previous cycles advisor services has tended to be a leading indicator of what will happen with investor services realigning first as rates start to rise and now slowing substantially and as i said actually increasing slightly their schwab one and banks rebalances in the month of june and thats again despite a net equity purchases as you all know we have supported this client cash allocation activity first via a range of organic sources cash on hand as well as cash that comes in via new accounts and also with principal and interest payment from our securities portfolio but to the extent that those three sources have been insufficient we have utilized a mix of temporary sources including cds and shortterm funding from the fhlb and borrowing an unexpected increase in deposit outflows from clients engaging more actively in the equity markets the pace of that activity has now dropped to a level that we can cover with those organic sources the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 18jul2023 in fact we have not initiated any new shortterm borrowings or cds since late may which means that we have already seen a decline in that supplemental funding again that encompasses cds fhlb and repo of billion since the peak in late may and as client cash realignment continues to slow and eventually reverses wed expect those supplemental funding balances to continue to decline over the next months and be mostly paid off by the end of and this means that they should not really be a factor in our earnings picture in and beyond looking out to the rest of the year as client cash allocation activity abates wed expect to see a return of transactional cash growth later this year and then as we continue to pay off the higher cost funding sources while driving strong organic growth we should see a stabilization of revenue and then a resumption of growth leading to a yearoveryear revenue decline of roughly to with our net interest margin expanding from here to reach a level in the mid basis points by  assuming the dot plot from a couple of weeks ago so two more 25basis point fed increases on the expense side weve already taken steps to trim our spending levels this year such that we now expect our adjusted expense growth to be somewhere in the 6ish percent range inclusive of roughly million onetime fdic surcharge meaning that our other spending is tracking roughly basis points below the range we communicated back in january as we have adjusted and optimized our expense base consistent with walts earlier comments now turning our attention to we expect to see strong growth in revenue and profitability driven by an expansion of net interest margin into the upper as we see a return of core deposit growth and payoff a vast majority of the supplemental funding weve accessed and the realization of at least billion of net run rate expense synergies including more than million in net reductions relative to the outlook we shared back in january and that would imply that adjusted expenses could be similar to or potentially even a little below levels from a capital standpoint our plan is to continue to conserve capital for the immediate future and we see a clear path toward growing our consolidated tier leverage ratio inclusive of aoci back to our operating objective at some point in at which point we could be in position to resume more opportunistic capital return and then looking even longer term we continue to see a significant opportunity for continued nim expansion even after we realize the benefits of paying off the supplemental funding and that comes from investing new money and reinvesting principal and interest from our existing securities portfolio at rates that are much higher than we earn today its important to note this would still happen even if rates fall from their peak as the dot plots currently suggest ive spoken at length this morning about some of the dynamics that are temporarily weighing on our financial performance and as those dynamics fade into the background we remain very confident that our financial formula will reassert itself to drive longterm earnings growth as it has for multiple decades its built on our through clients eyes strategy and no tradeoffs approach which positions us to drive sustainable and consistent organic growth and even as weve worked our way through multiple rate cycles made disruptive moves like cutting equity commissions to zero and acquiring ameritrade weve been able to convert that strong organic growth into client asset growth revenue growth and through ongoing expense discipline expanding margins and then through efficient capital management drive midteens plus eps growth through the cycle that has been the financial formula for schwab for much of our history and as we emerge from this unique period were extremely confident it will continue to reward our longterm stockholders for years decades to come the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 18jul2023 with that ill turn over to jeff to facilitate our qa jeff jeff edwards headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp thank you gents operator can you please remind everyone of our process and go ahead and start the qa portion of the program question and answer section operator yes thank you operator instructions and our first question is from ken worthington with jpmorgan you may go ahead kenneth b worthington q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning thanks for taking the question my question is on the revenue synergies from ameritrade and your expectations now in january i believe you expected billion to billion of revenue synergies from the transaction with bda balances as the leading driver and if so how have cash sorting in the revised bda agreement impacted both the size and the timing of your expected revenue synergies here peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah ill take that one thank you ken so i would say fundamentally we remain very very bullish on the revenue synergies and as you point out certainly a significant portion of those revenue synergies are coming from moving the bda balances from td bank over to schwab banks balance sheet over time and those continue despite the fact that the way that we have renegotiated the ida agreement thats more of a nearterm dynamic the longterm implication of that the longterm planning has not changed which is that wed expect to move those balances over our balance sheet and realize those revenue synergies from doing so but thats only a part of the story and i think the other part of the revenue synergies are were very very excited about and those come from allowing the legacy ameritrade clients to have access to schwabs broader array of wealth management solutions lending advice etcetera and rick talked in his comments about some of the early signs of progress of interest in those solutions if you look at the penetration rate of advice among their legacy retail clients within schwab its about ameritrade its about or and we think thats a huge untapped need we know those clients are interested in that advice and were very very excited about that opportunity which we think will unfold over multiple years operator thank you the next question is from dan fannon with jefferies you may go ahead daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning peter understanding that the client cash sorting has been slowing throughout the quarter but your outlook for resumption of deposit growth is prior to yearend just curious normally we have positive the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 18jul2023 seasonality with cash build around december are you assuming growth in deposits ex the normal seasonal benefit peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah dan i dont know if i want to parse it quite that fine i would say is we do expect that well see a resumption i mean if you look at the trends from frankly even from the first quarter from march to april april to may and may to june and you dont have to do too unusual i guess extrapolations to see that flipping so wed expect that well see return of deposit growth i would say ahead of that typical seasonal buildup indiscernible november and into december operator thank you the next question is from brian bedell with deutsche bank you may go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning thanks for taking my question maybe just on that subject if we do see the buildin deposits as we move through the year and into peter can you talk about what type of lcr ratio would you prefer to operate in and i think historically in the last year or so in the to range so well above but is that a range that you would generally like to stay in or in the new environment would you prefer to build liquidity over and above that range and then if its in that range could that imply faster fhlb paydown than your model potentially peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah so i mean i think i guess id say answer this a couple of ways i mean when we think about lcr what we really focus on is the lcr and then certainly theres lcr at the banks but theres also lcr at the parent and when we look at the lcr at the parent thats really driven more by whats happening on the brokerdealer side that tends to be the we have and so that is a function of whats happening in the margin balances free credit balances and so forth within the banks we certainly have ample access and ample liquidity a very very liquid portfolio there we have been running a little bit higher levels of cash id expect that as we continue to put some distance between now and where we were back in march and sort of the with some of the stresses around the banking system well continue to let those cash levels decline and that will be a contributor to paying down and retiring some of the cds and the fhlb so i would say that would probably be the bigger factor is continuing to let those cash balances decline back closer to our operating objective which is more around or of deposits operator thank you the next question is from steven chubak with wolfe research you may go ahead michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning its michael anagnostakis on for steven just maybe another one on the balance sheet here now that it feels like the dust has settled from the banking crisis is selling down a portion of the securities portfolio something youre considering to pay down high cost borrowing sooner and from a regulatory perspective would your lower tier leverage inclusive of aoci preclude you from crystallizing those losses thank you the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 18jul2023 peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah thanks very much for the question i know theres been a lot of i guess speculation on this and a lot of discussion about this im glad you asked this so let me reiterate first and foremost we do not need to and its something we said previously we do not need to sell securities we have plenty of liquidity to support the client cash allocation activity as we talked about that activity is slowing and we remain quite profitable our capital levels are growing and our nim is poised to improve as weve talked about at the same time we certainly recognize that selling securities can look good on paper from a financial standpoint as it would accelerate some of the trends that wed otherwise see things like increasing our go forward net interest margin net interest revenue accelerating the paydown of borrowings building our capital levels but the important point is thats an acceleration of trends that are already happening and were very mindful of the potential risks that doing something like that could be misunderstood or misperceived by the outside world and most importantly by our clients and so i would say it remains something we wont rule out but its not something we are actively pursuing at this time thanks for the question operator thank you our next question is from michael cyprys with morgan stanley you may go ahead michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning thanks for taking the question i was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on some of the steps you guys are taking to expand advice penetration within the retail customer set i think thats maybe around today advise penetration of the retail customers what actions can you guys do to accelerate and lift that higher over time what level do you think is achievable if you look out like five years is reasonable and which offerings and services do you think will be the most meaningful in helping drive that uplift richard a wurster a president the charles schwab corp yeah so i would say that we have lots of opportunity in driving advice penetration and the reason being that our clients are increasingly looking to us for advice they want help and guidance in all measures where we survey clients theyre asking for more help and guidance and wed like certainly for schwab clients to turn to us for help and guidance so we want to provide what they need weve done a lot to try to bolster our offerings and ill share a few things the first thing weve done is weve taken our proprietary schwab wealth advisory offering which is our fullservice wealth management offer to clients and weve invested in it tremendously in the past couple of years and weve seen the returns to that as you can see by the increase in flows or increase in net flows that we reported as well as the really strong client promoter scores that we consistently earn in that offer so the investments have been paying off and weve seen an acceleration of growth there and as i mentioned earlier a lot of it has come from ameritrade clients who didnt have access to a program like this previously that are now turning towards it so that is all encouraging we also as you are aware bought wasmer schroeder a few years ago were seeing just tremendous growth in the fixed income space for clients that want help and guidance there and then we are encouraged by what were seeing in schwab personalized indexing the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 18jul2023 we believe years from now taxable assets that will be the primary location that the clients save or invest in taking share from etfs over time and were at the forefront of that driving down the cost for clients to participate in that as well as the minimum asset size weve democratized access to personalized investing which is very much in line with our heritage and then finally what i would say is our san program our schwab advisor network program continues to grow and we gain really strong flows on our platform we want to make sure clients have access to whatever help and guidance they need whether its a schwab proprietary offer or something through our advisor network and we continue to see robust flows there the combination of all that is growing at schwab and its also growing among ameritrade clients so we think the future is really bright in wealth weve invested a lot in it and thankfully were seeing the returns to those investments both at schwab and among our ameritrade clients operator thank you our next question is from alex blostein with goldman sachs you may go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi good morning everybody i was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on sort of how net new money is allocating cash once it gets into schwab so as you think about your organic growth kind of net 5ish 6ish percent range recently what percentage of the cash that comes across actually goes into the schwab bank versus into some of the higheryielding options thanks peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah its a tough i mean we get this question a lot and its a really tough question to answer because it really is kind of what timeframe are you looking at when you answer that question i mean the money tends to come in heavily in the form of cash sort of or maybe in the form of cash but over time not surprisingly it gets invested and it gets invested in ways that look similar to our existing clients so quite often well bring in cash invest in the equity markets invest in mutual funds fixed income and typically leave some of that cash on the balance sheet as transactional cash so it really depends new accounts versus existing accounts tend to have different behavior but i would say that in aggregate over time as we grow new accounts those new accounts typically bring a level of transactional cash that helps to offset or more than offset any residual client cash realignment activity thats happening among our existing accounts and so that becomes an important source of deposit growth over time operator thank you the next question is from brennan hawken with ubs you may go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question im curious peter if you have considered what tlac if that was applied to schwab might mean and what that would mean as far as the longterm debt you might need to carry obviously not versus where we are today because weve got this big buildup of the wholesale but once we get to sort of steady state versus the steady state before this all began have you considered that and what impact that might have the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 18jul2023 peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yes we certainly have considered and looked at that and i think theres still a number of dimensions of that that are to be determined and so the implications are a little bit up in the air but i would say the bottom line is none of the implications we think are going to be in any way disruptive i mean theyll be very manageable depending on how the tlac is calibrated whether its calibrated at the gsib level or its calibrated sort of the lower level based on the analysis weve seen we could have either enough debt already or have to issue a very modest amount i mean sort of a couple of billion dollars billion billion of incremental debt so again when you think about the carrying cost of that its quite modest so we dont see that as being sort of a significant factor moving forward operator thank you the next question is from benjamin budish with barclays you may go ahead benjamin budish q analyst barclays capital inc hi there thanks for taking the question i wanted to double check on the incremental cost synergies you talked about in the slide deck you mentioned that the expense growth of kind of flat to negative is based on the assumption that you realize those savings is that sort of the plan that the remaining million plus the additional million will all be realized over the course of and then how do we think about the risk that expense growth could be slightly positive or just the kind of parameters around which we might think about modeling next years opex growth peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp sure so as we shared previously the million of remaining expense synergies related to the integration the majority of those will be unlocked as we complete the integration and then months after we complete integration and so as we shared previously we expect that the vast majority of that million would be realized on a run rate basis by the end of the million of incremental expense savings that walt previewed in his comments wed expect indiscernible of those to be realized by the end of and so those would have indiscernible impact on but those are incremental too those were not contemplated in the scenario that we had shared at the winter business update where i think we talked about something like to adjusted expense growth from to you take that and you just subtract that at least that million plus as we talked about thats how you get to flat to negative adjusted expense growth from to but again given the fact that were realizing some of the expense synergies related to integration in that will clearly have a benefit as we go from to as well so its really looking at two years of sort of below trend adjusted expense growth operator thank you the next question is from chris allen with citi you may go ahead chris allen q analyst citigroup global markets inc good morning everyone i was wondering if you can provide an update on the technological improvements expected for the lending platform this summer assuming deposit growth picks up later this year how do you see the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 18jul2023 the asset side of the balance sheet expanding do you see more of a mix shift towards lending versus rebuilding the securities book richard a wurster a president the charles schwab corp yeah weve got some exciting developments on the lending side one of the things were thrilled to do is launch a digital pledged asset line experience here during the month of july to our advisors and we anticipate that will be among the easiest and fastest pledged asset line experience in the industry well do the same in retail well follow with retail and theres a number of other things weve done on the lending side to make it easier for our higher net worth clients to get a mortgage through schwab weve also done things youve seen im sure with our investor advantage pricing which makes taking the loan through schwab as your client and have assets with us again among the lowest cost places to get a loan so we see the opportunity for meaningful growth here lending environment clearly is challenging so were not seeing the returns to those investments just yet that we might otherwise have seen but whats important is we are laying the foundation for when the lending environment is appealing more and more clients will turn to schwab for their lending because weve made it easier weve made it more seamless weve made it even less costly and there should be no better place to take a pledged asset line or a mortgage than through your relationship here at schwab so we feel confident that when the lending environment improves were going to be there operator thank you the next question is from patrick moley with piper sandler you may go ahead patrick moley q analyst piper sandler co yeah i just wanted to go back to the million of incremental cost saves wondering if you could elaborate a little more on the areas that those cost saves are coming from walt mentioned real estate savings as a driver and i know last week you announced that you were downsizing or closing offices and i think indiscernible so just wondering if you could maybe quantify the impact from that reduction in the real estate footprint and then maybe how much of that was already baked into the amtd integration cost saves that you guided to and how much of that is maybe newer thanks walter william bettinger a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp sure thanks so all of it is incremental and none of that was baked into the ameritrade integration saves i think one of the items thats important to understand is that over the last several years as we began preparation for the integration we recognized that having that go smoothly for the new clients from ameritrade that would be joining schwab was the single most important thing we could do and so when it came to spending and investing the answer was yes an awful lot in fact if you look at our current expenses today and compare them to the sum of what schwab and ameritrades expenses were at the time of the announcement of the acquisition theyre about higher than they were at that date and so this fairly significant ramp up of hiring and expenses that we have incurred in the last three years to ensure this integration went well we now will be faced with the opportunity to unwind that the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 18jul2023 so when i talk about millionplus in addition to the remaining million from integration from ameritrade thats what gets us to over billion in expense savings that well recognize between the remaining months in as well as as peter referenced in from the integration wrapping up operator thank you the next question is from kyle voigt with kbw you may go ahead kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning im assuming the repayment expectations for shortterm funding through is in part driven by the growing client cash and in part by the shrinking securities portfolio so my question is on the securities portfolio specifically if i look at average balances they were down about sequentially or billion i guess when you look at the current maturity schedule and expectation for prepayments in the current interest rate environment what are your updated expectations on how that securities portfolio how the balances could trend over the next months or maybe months peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp so the way i think about it is in terms of when we think about it we think about sort of the principal and interest payments off the securities portfolio and we use that as a mechanism to support the cash realignment activity and then also to pay down some of the shortterm borrowings and thats tracking about 5ish billion dollars per month billion per quarter as that portfolio shrinks that of course those monthly cash flows will decrease modestly but even in through next year wed still expect that to those monthly that monthly activity to be billion plus billion to billion somewhere in that range over the course of as well jeff edwards a headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp and just operator looking at the clock i think we have time for one last question before we wrap operator thank you our last question is from devin ryan with jmp securities you may go ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc thanks good morning most questions have been asked here maybe just one kind of indiscernible on the model securities lending revenues have been bouncing back here a little bit and just want to get a and that move the nim around so want to get a sense of how you guys think about kind of a normalized model of securities lending and if we should just be looking for kind of whats happening to capital markets i know when theres more active maybe ipo market or capital markets environment that can be better so just thinking about whats going to move that back to levels that were i think healthier back in late peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah so youre right so securities lending revenue does move around it can move around monthtomonth daytoday frankly based off of oftentimes demand for a relatively small number of hardtoborrow stocks and thats really what we focus on is the hardtoborrow stocks were the largest lender in the industry for those hard the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 18jul2023 toborrow stocks and many times they are event driven whether its a spac or despac situation or ipo or whatever it might be i think over time i guess i would say two things one is over time we would expect that securities lending revenue to grow with the growth in margin balances because that creates more inventory and the growth in our total client assets at the same time we see a significant opportunity to continue to grow sec lending revenue sort of irrespective of what happens with balances weve talked previously about the combination of the green and blue sec lending capabilities on the ameritrade side has access to more hardtoborrow stocks but on the on the blue side on the schwab side we have had some more advanced capabilities such as a fully a more mature fully paid program and so were very very excited about that combination and continue to unlock the significant opportunities that combination provides and for example making more of our clients aware of the fully paid opportunities so i think we see that as a revenue synergy from the combination and a great opportunity moving forward peter b crawford managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp okay and i think that we said that was our last question so let me just close us out here as were getting to the bottom of the hour theres no doubt that the last few months have presented some challenges for our clients our people and our business and while i spoke at the outset about the metaphorical fog that has obscured i think the enduring quality of the schwab franchise and as were sitting here today in this degree texas heat it feels like that fog is starting to clear and as it does i think what you see as a company building loyalty among clients that is among the highest in the industry producing consistent to organic growth positions strongly in the two fastestgrowing segments in wealth management delivering consistent profitability highlighted by a adjusted pretax margin during one of our toughest quarters in a long time and pursuing a lot of opportunities with the ameritrade integration and beyond to drive growth and to deliver even greater efficiency and as i hope youve gleaned over this past hour we remain very confident about the path forward and our future and we look forward to discussing our continued progress with you at our next update in october thanks everyone operator thank you that does conclude todays conference thank you
