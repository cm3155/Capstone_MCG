charles schwab corporation the  charles schwabs biggest moneymaker is its bank it is also a sore spot the company is trying to fix schwabs playbook of making easy money on customer deposits was upended when interest rates rose rapidly and people moved their cash to chase higher yields now schwab is looking to change how it uses customer deposits and make more money from lucrative services including loans and financial advice there is a lot riding on the makeover while schwab is the largest publicly traded us brokerage roughly half of its revenue comes from the bank banking helped schwab cut trading fees over the years and eventually eliminate commissions on online stock trades executives havent specified the timing or magnitude of potential changes so it isnt clear what schwabs bank will ultimately look like schwab has called a transition year but the market is skeptical after a pullback in schwabs stock is down about year to date while the broader sp is up their track record on execution over the last couple years has not been good as it relates to balancesheet management said bill katz a research analyst at td cowen who downgraded his rating on schwab after secondquarter earnings schwab is in the midst of a csuite shakeup chief financial officer peter crawford is retiring and is set to be succeeded on oct by mike verdeschi formerly citigroups treasurer chief operating officer joe martinetto earlier this year became executive chairperson of schwab banks and bernie clark head of adviser services moved to an advisory role banks make money off customer deposits in a variety of ways at schwab the focus has largely been on investing the cash in such assets as treasurys and mortgagebacked securities and less so on making loans directly to consumers and businesses that strategy was squeezed when rates rose the value of the longerterm bonds in schwabs investment portfolio declined just as many customers moved their deposits into higheryielding alternatives such as moneymarket funds to avoid taking losses on its longerterm investments schwab had to turn to pricier shortterm funding sources such as borrowing from the federal home loan bank system schwab is now looking to make its bank more nimble on the companys earnings call last month walt bettinger chief executive officer and cochairman said schwab plans to put more of its investment portfolio into shorterterm assets it might also offload more of its deposits to thirdparty banks these various actions should lead again over time to a bank that is somewhat smaller than our bank has been in recent years bettinger said by outsourcing deposits schwab can shrink its balance sheet and free up capital which the company could reinvest into the business or return to shareholders by doing share buybacks it provides us with greater flexibility crawford said in an interview schwab already offloads some deposits to td bank which offers a model for how such arrangements might work td bank pays schwab a monthly fee for the deposits and schwab pays a service fee to td bank the arrangement brought in about million of revenue for schwab in the second quarter on average balances of billion swept off its balance sheet in comparison schwab made more than billion of net interest revenue during the same period from a mix of assets which were mostly funded by the bank deposits on its balance sheet analysts largely believe the shift in bank strategy could benefit schwab over time but some question how schwab would replace its interestrelated earnings a schwab spokesperson said that the company would only consider offloading more deposits if doing so was beneficial for customers and shareholders and that such a move would take years meanwhile executives see plenty of room to use deposits for lending schwab only had about billion of bank loans on its balance sheet in the latest quarter compared with more than billion of deposits those loans had an average interest rate of in the second quarter schwabs bank loans are primarily mortgages home equity lines of credit and pledged asset lines which use customer portfolios as collateral the company said it is investing in technology to streamline the loan application and approval process and hiring experienced bankers to work on morecomplex loans another area schwab wants to expand is its financial advice and wealth management services which bring in feebased revenue that isnt as dependent on market conditions advice solutions brought in about million in the second quarter accounting for of total revenue schwab will be competing with such banking giants as jpmorgan chase bank of america and morgan stanley but schwab thinks it has an advantage former customers of td ameritrade which the company acquired in those customers were converted to schwab accounts recently and schwab thinks it can get them to use more of its services some analysts said schwab wont be able to shift its strategy until its balancesheet troubles are behind it in the second quarter bank deposits continued to decline and schwab was still paying off shortterm borrowings another headache more than billion of its balance sheet remained tied up in assets that are held to maturity meaning they wont be sold those assets earned an average yield of well below the federal reserves current benchmark interest rate of to it all comes down to the bank said alex blostein an analyst at goldman sachs dr william auch couldnt access his brokerage account as the stock market tumbled on monday morning shortly after the us market opened he tried to log into his charles schwab account he saw stocks were selling off and thought it could be a good opportunity to buy shares at a lower price instead he was locked out of his account for a few hours unable to sign in online or through the mobile app or to reach a customerservice representative over the phone you have one of the biggest trading days of the year and you cant get in said auch a 65yearold in sacramento calif its completely ridiculous charles schwab acknowledged that some customers experienced difficulties logging into their accounts on monday morning the brokerage said the issues had been resolved by around midday it is unclear exactly how many customers experienced problems with their brokerages but thousands of users reported outages on downdetectorcom a spokesperson for schwab said the platform experienced the highest level of volatility during the first few trading hours of mondays session since the early days of the pandemic the spokesperson said elevated trading volumes and a technical issue with a key vendor affected its systems which led to the logon issues and longer call wait times schwab didnt specify which vendor affected its operations mondays technical issues came just a few weeks after a botched update from cybersecurity company crowdstrike disrupted everything from air travel to payments around the world including some online functions for schwab customers retail brokerages have a long history of becoming inaccessible to their customers at periods of heavy market volatility often when investors are most eager to log in and adjust their portfolios as customers pile into their accounts it can overload the systems that connect brokerages websites and apps to the underlying plumbing that manages their stock trades and account balances during the covid19 pandemic outages repeatedly hit brokerages such as schwab mondays glitches show the problem hasnt gone away every time theres a large market move it seems like this happens said chris nagy a former managing director at td ameritrade who now works for healthy markets association an investoradvocacy group it makes you wonder have the brokers really done anything to improve their technology
