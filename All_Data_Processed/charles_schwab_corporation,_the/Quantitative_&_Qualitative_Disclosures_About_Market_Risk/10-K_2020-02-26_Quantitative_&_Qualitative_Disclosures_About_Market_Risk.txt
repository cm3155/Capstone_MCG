risk management schwabs business activities expose it to a variety of risks including operational credit market liquidity and compliance risks the company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures there can be no assurance that schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks our risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment risk measurement risk monitoring and reporting and risk mitigation controls we use periodic risk and control selfassessments control testing programs and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls the activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below culture the board of directors has approved an enterprise risk management erm framework that incorporates our purpose vision and values which form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization we designed the erm framework to enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by schwab in its business activities the framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size risk profile complexity and continuing growth of the company risk appetite which is defined as the amount of risk the company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy is developed by executive management and approved by the board of directors risk governance senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying measuring and controlling risks the global risk committee which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function is responsible for the oversight of risk management this includes identifying emerging risks assessing risk management practices and the control environment reinforcing business accountability for risk management supervisory controls and regulatory compliance supporting resource prioritization across the organization and escalating significant issues to the board of directors we have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite the risk metrics with risk limits and tolerance levels are established for key risk categories by the global risk committee and its functional risk subcommittees the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted the chief risk officer regularly reports activities of the global risk committee to the risk committee of the board of directors the board risk committee in turn assists the board of directors

oxley act of operational risk operational risk arises due to potential inadequacies or failures related to people internal processes and systems or from external events or relationships impacting the company andor any of its key business partners and third parties while operational risk is inherent in all business activities we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the companys risk appetite we have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk and use control testing programs and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls where appropriate we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance the insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation schwabs operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems to the extent schwab experiences business or system interruptions errors or downtime which could result from a variety of causes including natural disasters terrorist attacks technological failure cyber attacks changes to systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures our business and operations

technology processing servicing and support functions we manage the exposure to third party risk and promote a culture of resiliency through contractual provisions control standards ongoing monitoring of third party performance and appropriate testing we also maintain policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with all data whether the data is internal company information employee information or nonpublic client information we clearly define for employees contractors and third parties the expected standards of care for critical and confidential data we also provide regular training on data security model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports models are owned by several business units throughout the organization and are used for a variety of purposes model use includes but is not limited to calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments estimating interest

reputational or regulatory impact to the company the model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities incentive compensation risk is the potential for adverse consequences resulting from compensation plans that do not balance the execution of our strategy with risk and financial rewards potentially encouraging imprudent risktaking by employees we have implemented risk management processes including a policy to identify evaluate assess and manage risks associated with incentive compensation plans and the activities of certain employees defined as covered employees who have the authority to expose the company to material amounts of risk compliance risk schwab faces compliance risk which is the potential exposure to legal or regulatory sanctions fines or penalties financial loss or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws regulations rules or other regulatory requirements among other things compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments conflicts of interest disclosure obligations and performance expectations for products and services supervision of employees and the adequacy of our controls the

discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business guidance and control are provided through the creation approval and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees credit risk credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower counterparty or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations our exposure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios mortgage lending margin lending and client option and futures activities pledged asset lending securities lending activities and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts to manage the risks of such losses we have established policies and procedures which include setting and reviewing credit limits monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties and adjusting margin pal option and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments liquidity and investment portfolios schwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios which include us agency and nonagency mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities corporate debt securities us agency notes us treasury securities certificates of deposit us state and

mortgagebacked securities do not have explicit credit ratings however management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the us government or us governmentsponsored enterprises mortgage lending portfolio the bank loan portfolio includes first mortgages helocs and other loans the credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations delinquencies nonaccrual loans chargeoffs and recoveries all are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses our residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum ltv ratios cash out limits and minimum fair isaac corporation fico credit scores the specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan for example whether the property is a primary or secondary residence whether the loan is for investment property whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo schwab does not originate or purchase residential loans

arrangements relating to margin loans pals option and futures positions securities lending agreements and securities purchased under agreements to resell resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations additionally for margin loans pals options and futures positions and securities lending agreements collateral arrangements require

its client accounts schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations mutual funds and other financial institutions even if schwabs clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to schwab market risk market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions schwab is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on our interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets to manage interest rate risk we have established policies and procedures which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity risk to remain within these limits we manage the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios management monitors established guidelines to stay within the companys risk appetite our measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue or economic value of equity actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument we are indirectly exposed to option futures and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with schwab additionally we earn mutual fund and etf service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material net interest revenue simulation for our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulations include all interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets primarily include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next months beginning december and of a gradual basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period december increase of basis points decrease of basis points the yearoveryear change in net interest revenue sensitivities reflects lower interest rates across the yield curve producing higher adverse sensitivity to lower rates as funding costs more rapidly reach rate floor assumptions in addition to measuring the effect of a gradual basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel and nonparallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue economic value of equity simulation management also uses economic value of equity eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates nonmaturity deposit behavior and pricing assumptions expected phaseout of libor the company has established a firmwide team to address the likely discontinuation of libor as part of our efforts we have inventoried our libor exposures the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans in purchasing new investment securities we ensure that appropriate fallback language is in the securitys prospectus in the event that libor is unavailable or deemed unreliable we are updating loan agreements to ensure new liborbased loans adequately provide for an alternative to libor furthermore we plan to phaseout the use of libor as a reference rate in our new lending products before december consistent with our through clients eyes strategy our focus throughout the libor transition process is to ensure clients are treated fairly and consistently as this major change is occurring in the financial markets the market transition process has not yet progressed to a point at which the impact to the companys consolidated financial statements of libors discontinuation can be estimated liquidity risk liquidity risk is the potential that schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses due to its role as a source of financial strength cscs liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of csco the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries principal and interest due on corporate debt dividend payments on cscs preferred stock and returns of capital to common stockholders the liquidity needs of csco are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposits we have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions we seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the company to meet its obligations to this end we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted we employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity we conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during marketrelated or companyspecific liquidity stress events liquidity is also tested at key subsidiaries and results are reported to the financial risk oversight committee a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate primary funding sources schwabs primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts these funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations maturities and sales of investment securities repayments on loans securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts repurchase agreements and cash provided by external financing to meet daily funding needs we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and shortterm investments for unanticipated liquidity needs we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments including us treasury securities additional funding sources in addition to internal sources of liquidity schwab has access to external funding the need for shortterm borrowings from external debt facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements scheduled liquidation of
