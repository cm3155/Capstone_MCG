federal reserve and fdic the agencies before july in reviewing the plan the agencies noted meaningful improvements over prior plan submissions the agencies did not identify any deficiencies in the plan but did identify one shortcoming related to the implementation of governance mechanisms we submitted to the agencies our plan to remediate this shortcoming in line with the expected timeframe in addition to the above letter the federal reserve and fdic jointly issued a final rule that was published in the federal register on november this final rule revised the implementation requirements under the dodd frank acts resolution planning provisions by means of establishing a biennial filing cycle for the us gsibs including state street this cycle alternates between a targeted resolution plan followed two years later by a full resolution plan the agencies have published the scope for the upcoming targeted resolution plan to include the core elements of resolution planning and some specific firm level information including impactsfrom the covid19 pandemic the next 165d resolution plan is a targeted plan tobe submitted by july in the event of material financial distress or

required to contribute to ssif any remaining assets it is required to contribute to ssif under the support agreement ssif would be required to provide capital and liquidity support to the beneficiary entities to support such entities continued operation and the parent company would be expected to commence chapter proceedings under the us bankruptcy code no person or entity other than a party to the support agreement should rely including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditors perspective or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our entities on any of our affiliates being or remaining a beneficiary entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement a recapitalization event is defined under the support agreement as the earlier occurrence of one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or the authorization by the parent companys board of directors for the parent company to commence bankruptcy proceedings these thresholds are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support the spoe strategy and the obligations under the support agreement may result in the recapitalization of state street bank and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the parent company at an earlierstage of financial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms inplace an expected effect of the spoe strategy and applicable tlac regulatoryrequirements is that losses will be imposed on the parent company shareholdersand the holders of longterm debt and other forms of tlac securities currentlyoutstanding or issued in the future by the parent company as well as on any otherparent company creditors before any of its losses are imposed on the holders of thedebt securities of the parent companys operating subsidiaries or any of theirdepositors or creditors or before

more importantly they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales in addition our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors as discussed earlier under asset liquidity state street banks membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with

billion in unsecured senior debt on march we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due agency credit ratings our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings relative market position strong risk management strong capital ratios diverse liquidity sources including the global capital markets and clientdeposits strong liquidity monitoring procedures and preparedness for current or future regulatory developmentshigh ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offerproducts serving markets and engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratingsa downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverseeffect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets whichcould increase the related cost of funds in turn this could cause the sudden andlargescale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients which could lead todrawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements undersecurities purchase commitments or require additional collateral or forceterminations of certain trading derivative contracts a majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateralagreements with
