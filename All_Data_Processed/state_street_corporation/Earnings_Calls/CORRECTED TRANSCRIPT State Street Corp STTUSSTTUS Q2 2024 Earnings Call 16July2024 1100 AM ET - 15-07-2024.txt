and injury that resulted from this senseless action each victim was a participant in our democratic process which makes this act an affront to all we extend our thoughts and condolences to all those impacted at this time we hope for unity and respect in our country disagreement can and must sit along civility and a commitment to an even better america now turning to the second quarter earlier today we released our financial results which represented sustained momentum as we delivered good yearoveryear fee and total revenue growth in both and for the first half of the year along with continued expense discipline this resulted in modest positive total operating leverage pretax margin of almost and a return on equity of nearly in the quarter we also continued to take important steps in the transformation and simplification of our operating model as we successfully consolidated our second operations joint venture in india in the quarter these actions will enable state street to continue to improve client experience and will unlock further productivity savings in the years ahead in may the transition to t1 settlement was a significant event for global investors importantly it presented state street with an opportunity to demonstrate our position as an essential partner to our clients our role in successfully assisting clients through this transition reinforced our value to clients and underscored the depth of our operational capabilities the financial market context in was mixed while daily average global equity market levels continued to move higher and equity markets again reached new alltime highs in the second quarter gains continued to be narrowly concentrated in a few names meanwhile fixed income markets struggled in as geopolitical risk continued economic data generally remained robust and investors priced in more gradual cycle of rate cuts even as the ecb delivered its first rate cut since the pandemic for this market backdrop we remain focused and successfully executed against our key strategic priorities turning to slide of our investor presentation i will review our highlights before eric takes you through the quarter in more detail beginning with our financial performance second quarter eps was as compared to in the yearago period the durable nature of our business was evident in the quarter as yearoveryear strength in management fees fx trading and nii more than offset a previously disclosed client transition that state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 negatively impacted servicing fee revenues helping to drive revenue growth of we also remain focused on tightly managing our cost base while continuing to make investments in our businesses total expenses increased by less than year over year supported by our ongoing productivity efforts turning to our business momentum while you can which you can see in the middle of the page we continued to execute well against our strategy making progress in a number of key areas aimed at generating further fee revenue growth which gives us confidence in our positioning as we look ahead within asset services we generated auca wins of billion which was well distributed regionally and included more than billion of fastertoinstall backoffice custody in line with our targeted sales strategy encouragingly roughly a quarter of the auca wins this quarter came from an alpha mandate in the apac region the win is a large new client for state street covering a broad set of our services including the back office this mandate is another proof point that alpha is an attractive client value proposition globally alpha creates a clear competitive advantage for state street that strategically positions us to deepen existing client relationship and as demonstrated this quarter win new longterm client relationships in turn helping to drive future growth this ongoing new business performance coupled with an anticipated increase in installations positions us well for future servicing fee growth servicing fee revenue wins amounted to million up from million in the first quarter this is the fourth quarter in a row of strong servicing fee revenue wins totaling over million over the last months our pipeline is strong and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our increased servicing fee revenue sales goal of million to million this year at global advisors buoyed by higher average equity markets management fees were million an increase of year over year with aum reaching a record trillion at quarter end while ga experienced aggregate net outflows in the quarter it was largely driven by a limited number of client rebalancings encouragingly we continue to make progress in a number of key strategic focus areas for example total net etf inflows amounted to billion benefited from continued market share expansion in us lowcost equity etfs regionally we also saw spdr gain market share in emea elsewhere global advisors announced the planned strategic investment in envestnet a leading provider of integrated technology data and wealth solutions this investment consistent with state streets wealth services strategy will enhance global advisors access to the independent wealth advisory and highnetworth distribution channels driving future growth nii performance was strong driven by a number of targeted management actions over the last year to support nii growth these include increased engagement with our clients to offer them financing and cash solutions resulting in higher deposit loan and sponsored repo balances while we also carefully expanded our investment portfolio in these actions have contributed to three quarters in a row of sequential nii and revenue growth as well as positive total operating leverage in our balance sheet remained strong enabling over million of capital return in the second quarter and over million year to date our financial strength was evident with the release of the federal reserves annual stress test results in june subsequently and consistent with our commitment to return capital to our shareholders we were pleased to announce our intention to increase state streets quarterly common stock dividend by to per share beginning in the third quarter subject to approval by our board of directors state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 as we look ahead we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders this year subject to market conditions and other factors to conclude our strong start to the year continued in the second quarter we delivered both fee and total revenue growth which supported modest total operating leverage year over year and a return on equity of nearly in the quarter all while continuing to make significant investments in our business controlling expenses and returning capital to our shareholders i am pleased with the progress we are making to drive better business momentum and sales performance as we execute against the sharpened revenue strategy we recorded another alpha mandate win in the quarter which demonstrated the clear advantage that strategy brings to our organization by delivering a large and completely new client relationship to state street we already have good line of sight into and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our goals of to new alpha clients and million to million of servicing fee revenue wins this year and with that let me hand the call over to eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail eric w aboaf vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp thank you ron and good morning everyone starting on slide we reported eps of for the quarter as compared to in the second quarter a year ago eps was slightly lower year on year but would have been positive growth were it not for an million reserve release last year as ron noted we delivered revenue growth year over year reflecting both higher net interest income up as well as higher fee revenues up which supported modestly positive total operating leverage in the quarter the second quarters strong performance contributed to an encouraging first half of the year with both positive fee and positive total operating leverage on a yeartodate basis excluding notable items relative to the prioryear period turning now to slide periodend auca and aum again increased to record levels largely supported by market tailwinds as you can see on the right panel of this slide market indicators related to our trading business remained challenging in the quarter though we were pleased to see improved client volumes across our fx trading venues which i will discuss shortly turning to slide servicing fees declined year on year as higher average equity market levels and net new business excluding a previously disclosed client transition were more than offset by pricing headwinds and lower client activity and adjustments including the asset mix shift into low earning cash and cash equivalents the impact of the previously disclosed client transition was a headwind of approximately percentage points to year onyear growth while lower client activity and adjustments including the asset mix shift into cash was a headwind of approximately percentage point on yearonyear growth in addition we saw the pace of quarterly installations track below expectations in and we do however anticipate a pickup over the next few quarters as our higher level of recent sales begin to onboard sequentially servicing fees were up reflecting higher average equity market levels and client activity as transaction volumes ticked back up and we saw clients start to put cash back to work we generated million of servicing fee revenue wins in and more than million over the last four quarters with the vast majority in back state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 office consistent with our strategy to prioritize fasterinstalling custody mandates at periodend we had million of servicing fee revenues to be installed and trillion of auca to be installed moving to slide management fees were up yearonyear primarily reflecting our higher average market levels and net inflows from prior periods partially offset by the impacts of our strategic etf repricing initiative which we believe is starting to pay off in both volumes and revenues sequentially the benefit of higher average market levels was offset by net flows and lower performance fees we are pleased with the steady growth we are delivering in global advisors in the second quarter we continued to expand the breadth of our offerings through the launch of new funds as we continue to broaden our product range and geographies our investment management business had healthy pretax margin of in the second quarter up percentage points yearonyear and up percentage points quarteronquarter now turning to slide as i noted we saw a very nice uptick in client activity in our markets business with higher volumes across our major fx venues this helped to drive fx trading revenue growth of yearonyear though volatility remained muted with compressed margin securities finance revenues also benefit from higher balances on both agency lending and prime services however our us specials activity was subdued in the quarter which impacted margins and contributed to the yearonyear decline in securities finance revenues moving to software and processing fees second quarter performance continued to benefit from strong client engagement with crd though the cadence of onpremise renewals negatively impacted yearonyear performance which is shown in greater detail on the following slides on slide as you can see softwareenabled and professional services revenues increased in the quarter and we expect these revenues to represent a greater proportion of our frontoffice software and data business over time as we transition another clients from onpremise to more durable saas model over the last year as we outlined in may we believe our software business can be a significant revenue growth driver for state street potentially reaching billion in annual revenues over the next five years in addition we are pleased with the continued momentum were seeing in alpha we reported an additional alpha mandate win and two mandates went live in bringing the total number of live mandates to at quarter end as ron mentioned this quarters alpha win represents a brandnew 10year relationship with a large apac client we view longterm alpha mandates like this are a key benefit of our differentiated alpha strategy turning to slide nii was stronger than expected this quarter up yearonyear and up sequentially to million as higher investment portfolio yields and higher loan growth more than offset continued deposit mix shift in both periods in addition on a quarteronquarter basis we proactively increased our investment portfolio balances at higher yields which benefited nii looking at the strong quarterly performance relative to our expectations in early june we did see an inflow of valuable noninterestbearing deposits in midjune and again in late june as clients geared up for the holiday weekend although i would note that we did see some reversal during the first week of july similarly nii also benefited from higher interestbearing balances due to our client engagement efforts as well as better spreads and volumes within our sponsored repo business as more clients join the program average state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 deposits increased yearonyear and quarteronquarter we would expect to continue to operate at this higher level of deposit balances as we look to the back half of the year turning to slide yearonyear expense growth was contained to less than in the second quarter we continued to invest in the business while also delivering productivity benefits in two key areas the first is associated with our decision to consolidate two operations joint ventures in india late last year in this quarter the yearonyear savings associated with these two jv consolidations are approximately million in the quarter excluding integration costs second we benefited from our ongoing organizational process improvements and initiatives including streamlining and delayering staff functions to increase our management span of control which enabled us to lower our head count on a pro forma basis including the jvs by five percentage points yearonyear as detailed on the bottom left of the slide together these actions helped to drive down compensation and benefit costs by yearonyear in the second quarter and facilitate our ability to reinvest in our franchise the combination of the jv consolidations along with our ongoing initiatives serves as a catalyst and importantly gives us confidence as we continue to deliver on our strategy to simplify our global operating model with meaningful benefits expected to build over time including more productivity saves as well as an ability to better serve our clients and invest for the future moving to slide as you can see our capital levels remained strong and comfortably above the regulatory minimums as of quarter end our standardized cet1 ratio of was slightly higher from the prior quarter as capital generated from earnings was partially offset by continued dividends and share repurchases as well as higher rwas as we support our clients which in turn drove higher fees and nii we returned over million in the first quarter to shareholders followed by million through common share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter as we have tried to strike right balance between our capital return goals and the support of our clients looking ahead to the back half of the year we have announced a planned per share quarterly common dividend increase on the heels of a strong performance under this years ccar starting in and subject to board approval in addition our intention is to accelerate the pace of quarterly buybacks relative to the first half of the year however given the more modest level of repurchase activity so far this year the full year payout ratio for will likely be closer to the to range in line with our mediumterm targets in summary we are pleased with our second quarter and first half results which demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategy to drive sustained business momentum while delivering positive total operating leverage excluding notable items with that let me cover our improved fullyear outlook which i would highlight continues to have the potential for variability given the uncertain economic and political environment were operating in in terms of our current macro assumptions as we stand here today we are assuming global equity markets are flat to second quarter end for the remainder of the year our rate outlook broadly aligns with the current forward curve as of quarter end while we expect both fx market volatility and specials to remain muted given our strong start to the year and higher average market levels we now expect that total fee revenue will likely be in the range of up to on a fullyear basis somewhat better than our prior expectations for roughly yearonyear growth state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 turning to nii given our performance along with the continued benefit of management actions we have taken to support nii growth this year we now expect fullyear nii will be up slightly yearoveryear which is also better than our previous guide of down roughly on a fullyear basis finally given these improved top line expectations fullyear expenses are likely to be somewhat higher than our prior outlook of up this year we now expect expenses excluding notable items to be up about this year given the expected revenuerelated costs importantly given this improved outlook we now expect to deliver both positive fee operating leverage and positive total operating leverage for the full year excluding notable items and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer state street corp thank you eric operator we can open it up for questions question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions your first question comes from glenn schorr with evercore isi your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks so much question on global advisors you had some institutionalled outflows in the last two quarters despite the strong markets im just curious how much of that is a function of rebalancing and are we supposed to expect more going forward given the stronger equity markets and are you seeing similar trends in your custody base thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah hi glenn its ron you have it correct there most of it or the vast majority of it is around client rebalancing in one case an extremely large client thats rebalancing away from certain asset classes so its idiosyncratic we dont expect it to continue and we feel very comfortable with the trajectory that global advisors is on both in the institutional business and in the etf business glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay ron while we have you theres been several articles over the last year or so talking about a certain european bank potentially selling their servicing platform youve been linked to it as you should be youve been great in consolidating things in the past so im not asking you to comment on that i am asking as some shareholders just prefer buybacks which you might think is too nearterm im curious on your thoughts conceptually on how you approach these things if there were any lessons learned from the brown brothers harriman saga and just conceptually how youre thinking about any consolidation opportunities in services thanks state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah so glenn i mean weve been pretty consistent about this we have a very very strong market position now some of that in the past has been built by ma if you go back to the but if you think about where we are now its very strong and the vast majority of our activity is around organic buildout of our business some of that just in terms of focusing on clients within geographies and some of that focused on building capabilities and extending them to other geographies that is by far the what our focus is to the extent and ive said this in the past i mean ma is not a strategy but it can help us to effectively implement our strategy and it is superior to if it passes the test of being superior to a return of capital to shareholders then well consider it but our focus is on building out organically returning capital to shareholders at a reasonable pace and continuing to excel at what we do glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks ron elizabeth lynn a executive vice president global headinvestor relations state street corp operator can we move to the next question operator your next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning so great result on the nii and we heard the updated outlook for slightly up this year now eric just wondering that would still imply a lower second half versus this really strong second quarter and i know theres a lot of uncertainty still out there in the environment so can you just help us think through what are you contemplating in terms of how deposits track from here and what caveats should we continue to think in mind if in fact there is still second half comes off of this second quarter real strength thanks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp ken its eric as you said were pleased with the second quarter results on nii some of that is the interest rate environment but good portion of that is the management actions weve been taking in terms of engaging with our clients on deposits and really being there for them on both sides of the balance sheet as we lend and support their growth as well this quarter was particularly strong we had a nice tailwind from longterm rates during the quarter that helped you saw us build out our investment portfolio a little more deposits ticked up second half of june and towards the end especially on noninterest bearing but what i find pleasing is that deposits are coming in stronger across the what ill call the pricing stack the transactional deposits the exception price deposits and the initiative so across the spectrum and thats really a testament to the engagement that weve had with our clients to be there i think as we look forward into the third state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 quarter and fourth quarter we still see some of the headwinds and tailwinds that weve talked about shortterm rates seem like will start to trend down thatll be a little bit of a headwind deposits were still seeing some of that rotation from noninterestbearing to interestbearing now that is slowing that was that rotated out about billion this past quarter and thats been less than the prior quarters but that still continues and still a little bit of pricing and mix shift that were seeing in the interestbearing deposit base so that that we see is just playing out through the end of the year but at a more modest pace the the offsets to that are mix of longterm rates the lending that we continue to do lending is up doubledigits and thats been purposeful to support our clients and to support nii and then tactically adjusting the investment portfolio and so its the net of those that probably will come in with some erosion over the next couple quarters but were seeing a place where deposits are could come in at a nice and robust level on our balance sheet lending continues and so were getting to a point where were going to start to see i think an inflection of nii and a bottoming which is nice and we can see that over the next few quarters hard to tell exactly when but with the headwinds and tailwinds kind of ill say equalizing over time it gives us a good basis to look forward ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then ron one question you mentioned that you think that the kind of core fees growth should get better from here and just wanted to ask you to deepen on that a little bit i know that youve mentioned onboardings and such but we still have that deconversion working against and you mentioned the episodic stuff and the etf stuff but like i think that really people are looking for on the increments so is that what drives that incrementally better fee guide for the second half is that were finally going to see like those that servicing and management fee line start to show a better rate of change ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yes so theres i think you largely have it but let me go a little bit deeper ken because if you think about lets talk about core servicing fees what really drives it first is retention second is the amount and rate of onboarding and then third is new business and sales and then rinse and repeat and our retention levels which they weve talked about them before their time and were continuing to track well against them even coming a little bit higher than what we had planned second onboardings as eric noted theyve been slower than expected this year but we see lots of visibility going forward to that increasing weve got a big book there to onboard and that will start to onboard or should start to onboard at an accelerating rate and then third is sales and theres two things going on there one the amounts we upped it in we upped it again in were on track for that increased servicing fee sales target but we also have disproportionate focus on traditional back office fees either standalone or if theyre associated with alpha making sure that when an alpha assignment comes onboard the back office conversions occur first its part of the learning in this whole alpha process so that by itself gives us encouragement and then and eric will probably want to go into this a little bit more the deconversion that seems like weve talked about it forever i mean were hitting bottom right now in terms of that so well start to see improvement on that as a comp and as its a fact and move beyond it starting in the next quarter or two so thats servicing fees and management fees we are very encouraged by what were seeing at ssga its been its part of a carefully crafted strategy both in the institutional and etfs weve talked about etf flows weve talked about state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 market share and the very important low cost etfs which in effect represent penetration into the retail market all that is working well and then finally weve had this historically low volatility in fx nonetheless the team has been highly focused on continuing to build share within our clients to move up on the panels and you saw some of that pay off in terms of fx and securities finance again theres been a new strategy put in place there and some progress there so this is much of what we do is a game of inches but theres a lot of inches coming together here that we feel quite good about ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thanks for that ron operator your next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs your line is open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thank you for taking my questions would like to start with euro deposits the ecb cut rates this quarter so curious to hear i know euro i believe is your second biggest currency in your deposit base so curious about what impact that you saw from that cut where was the beta on that cut and was it roughly equivalent to the betas you saw on the final increases and based on that experience how does that inform your expectation for when we see cuts in the fed funds eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp brennan its eric its nice to see the industry environment top out and begin to reverse though i think itll reverse slowly weve seen the beginning of that and feels like itll take some time which will be fine because remember our portfolio and our balance sheet is roughly neutral and relatively insulated now from interest rate increases or decreases we have a slight sensitivity across the balance sheet but its slight if all central banks across the curve cut rates by basis points were talking about million per quarter impact on a billion base of full year nii so thats the were talking about small effects to your point euro is a good place to start because euro rates increase lagged on the way up and now are starting to move in the opposite direction we have said and the euro experience on this first rate move has demonstrated that we expect largely to see symmetry in the betas so as rates rose we lagged and then the betas increased over time towards the back end of the rate cycle and what weve said is area by area transaction rate deposits exception rate deposits and the initial rate deposits well tend to see the reversal of that and so specifically in euros we did see that the beta on the first tick down was similar to the beta on the last tick up and i think is a good representation largely of what we expect to see and that means that if you step back even further we feel like our pricing is set at a healthy level we have a range of pricing and pools of deposits and in a way have built real engagement with our clients so they understood the model as rates floated up and similarly they understand the model as rates slowed it down in the balance of trade and it comes together nicely brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 got it thanks for that thanks for that i appreciate it thinking about another factor that has been a bit more robust recently repo has been pretty strong in recent quarters do you think based on whats been happening in the marketplace that that strength is sustainable and it seems as though the nii story is playing out better than you had originally anticipated kind of obvious given you brought up guidance but is that another x factor that could allow for the back half of the year to maybe see less of a pronounced stepdown than your improved guidance seems to continue to embed eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp brennan its eric again theres been a lot of talk about repo notwithstanding that most of the nii we earn on our balance sheet is really based on deposit funding and lending so of our nii is around deposits loans investment portfolio were talking about which is on repo so just for context and it is true repo nii came in a little bit better than expected in the second quarter why because there was some dislocation in the overnight repo operation of the fed relative to sofr so clients came our way we also saw a dealer balance sheet strain but the higher than expectation was in the million to million range its not a it was nice to take and it was nice to be there for our clients but in fact repo has been relatively flat to actually down a smidge over the last couple quarters and thats because it tends to be a thinner margin but a useful way to accommodate our clients and we think its not going to be a large driver of the coming nii its fully included in our guide i think the real big moving parts are really around deposits loans and then followed by investment portfolio and the mix of long and short rates that well see brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from jim mitchell with seaport global your line is open jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning eric maybe just following up a little bit on the nii story you talk about potentially an inflection coming can you discuss maybe the timing of that and then when i look at your asset yields the htm book is still weighing that down can you talk about maybe the pace of maturity on that htm book thats yielding a little over and how much how long it takes to kind of get that back coming back in is that a big part of your inflection story next year thanks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp jim its eric calling an inflection or a turn in nii is one of the hardest things to do and so weve been our outlook is that in the next few quarters well begin to see that but well first go from the trends that were seeing to a stabilization it will bounce around some and then over time tick upwards the factors are multifaceted and with a number of ins and outs youre right the investment portfolio is turning over it turned over quite a bit in the second half of last year its now turning over by about billion maybe billion to billion a quarter and thats across htm and afs and because there are some longerdated bonds in htm those roll through a little more slowly but in a way what we have is a sustained amount of ill say tailwind that comes with that because remember the rollons in the state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 portfolio versus the rolloffs those are worth solid basis point250 basis point of spread differential and that will play through the books as a nice tailwind assuming long rates stay somewhere in the area and the primary change on the curve is at the front end so i think it will be a component right now the biggest component is really the deposit mix pricing levels of noninterestbearing thats whats moving the needle the most i mean all these factors matter and i think as the deposits stabilize and weve started to see total deposit levels stabilize the last few quarters we have to see now the mix stabilize once that happens the natural benefit from the investment portfolio rolling through right and then the growth in loans and youve seen us lean into lending lending is up more than yearonyear because were trying to be out there for our clients and as we lend to our clients they actually often do additional servicing business with us that factor and the investment portfolio and the longterm rates will then turn to a net positive impact on nii in the coming quarters jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thats really helpful and maybe just to your point on deposit growth being a key driver now that were looking at rate cuts indiscernible is less do you feel like rate cuts can be a catalyst for growth based on historical experience how do you think about getting back to kind of more normal growth levels in deposits what do we need to see eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp i think the direct answer is that the rate environment has moved around quite a bit and weve seen the deposit effect from the rate environment i think those are relatively been those have been telegraphed through the banking system and weve also seen the fed balance sheet actions as theyve been tightening conditions with our balance sheet although thats slowing and then the overnight reverse repo operation isnt easing weve seen that telegraph through so i think the exogenous factors that have driven deposits over the last two years have largely been telegraphed and the modest number of interest rate cuts i dont expect to have that much of an impact on deposit levels well see but thats our kind of sense from talking with our clients and analyzing the vast array of data that we have what we feel will make the difference over time is sales so we talk a lot about servicing fee sales targeting million to million this year thats up from million in the year before and even less than the year before that and with a tilt towards custody and remember its the custodial activity not just the accounting or the middle office but the custodial activity that brings with it balances deposit balances because theyre needed as part of the buffer or the to handle the transactional activities that we process for clients and so as we look forward as sales continue to accelerate and then we onboard those sales because both have to happen thats what we expect will bring on additional deposits in a way are part of our organic growth model which will bring fee growth but also bring deposit growth and thus nii into the system at i think at a nice rate and it will be year by year by year that that will help drive growth jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay all very helpful thanks thanks eric state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 operator your next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hello hi good morning ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i did just want to key off of the last comment around the sales and to your point million to million is the goal for this year obviously on page you show us what the rev wins are for and million and million so that leaves us with an expectation that youre going to be able to bump that up pretty aggressively towards the million level for each of and and so it gets to my question of what gives you the confidence in that is that a function of these are already sales that are in contract and its just the installation of the new wins that hits this page and so that gives you a lot of confidence that you can generate that million level in each of the next two quarters ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp hey betsy its ron let me take that firstly just to clarify that these numbers that were talking about are sales and not installs right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp so it wouldnt include anything thats under contract and subject to onboarding at this point but what i mean i think the way to think about it is this that if you thats why eric gave the fourquarter number there third and fourth quarter historically for us tend to be a little bit better second half of the year is a little bit better than the first half of the year so thats point number one point number two the pipeline and we feel pretty good about the pipeline so thats why were continuing to affirm confidence in that target that we have of million to million betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it perfect yeah and i can see in last year the second half was so history yes obviously shows that that should happen so thats great okay so then the followup ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 betsy let me clarify the first part of my message because i was not clear there betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp the number would include things that are in contract but not include anything thats actually been onboarded so when you see the tobeonboarded number that we have out there that includes basically past sales so i hope thats clear i didnt mean to confuse that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay appreciate it thank you and then the followup just on the buyback i understand youve got the opportunity for increasing buybacks and im expecting that youre going to be flexing that versus your slr constraint is that fair and with slr at and the minimum at that feels like youve got a lot of room so just want to understand how youre thinking about what the what level of slr you want to hold regulatory minimum is what kind of buffer should we expect that youre anticipating holding on top of that just as were working through our models on how much buybacks we estimate for you thank you eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp betsy its eric let me take that as we had said and youre reflecting on buybacks were lighter in first quarter at million then we booked million in the second quarter we expect that pace to accelerate into the third quarter and then again into the fourth quarter so thats our intention and we have a good amount of room and capital generation each quarter to be able to deliver on that in terms of the constraints the ratio constraints the most important one for us and i think for our various stakeholders is the cet1 ratio and that were i think we can continue to operate at at a good pace at a good level but also that allows us a good pace of accelerating buybacks the tier leverage or the supplementary leverage ratio are informative but actually relatively manageable right with the right level of preferred equity we could we can operate where we need to i think weve been clear on tier leverage what our range is and well operate within that range and we can adjust the preferred equity stack as necessary weve not really formalized at least externally a supplementary leverage ratio range but id say it kind of flows in a similar way as the tier leverage and you can think of those as related from a conceptual and operational standpoint and both of them are eminently manageable and are not really the constraint when it comes to common share buybacks betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 right okay thats great and then when were thinking about the pace accelerating from here is that total dollars or is that the pace of up basis points qonq how should we think about which pace youre talking about eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp when we talk buybacks theres always the depends on market conditions and the environment and so forth so we always want to be careful with that and youd expect that of us as a wellrun and a management team thats both careful but also leans into capital return and youve seen our commitment and i think we certainly feel the million in the first quarter was below what we would have liked to deliver we feel that million was below what we would have liked to deliver so i think theres a solid increase coming you can think about it in dollar terms two points begin to create a line but that could be a curve as well and i think youve got enough to go on i think youve got betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you so much i really appreciate it eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp youve got enough to go on betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah no i really appreciate and i appreciate the conceptual chart thanks so much ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp youre welcome operator your next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i just want to make sure i understand what youre saying and not read too much into it but i think what youre saying is over the next two quarters you should be pretty much done with the nii declines you should be pretty state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 much done with the noninterestbearing deposit declines and you should be pretty much done with the decommission of the major client am i reading too much into that or did i hear that correctly eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp mike its eric with regard to nii and noninterestbearing deposits ive said the next few quarters so im giving myself a little bit of room to be honest because its hard to predict perfectly and so ill stick with a few quarters i think that kind of works and that certainly covers your range and maybe a little bit more so we just want to live through this but we can see i think over the horizon here in a way and thats what we wanted to communicate on the client deconversion if you recall we said this would be the largest year on a yearonyear basis it was originally worth about percentage points of total fees we said about a percentage point yearonyear this year point yearonyear last year and about point yearonyear next year so by the end of this year well be through ill call it threequarters of the effect but therell still be a piece of that coming through next year and then it will be behind us mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and you also mentioned continuing pricing pressure which weve talked about for about years which is nothing new but you did highlight pricing pressure so in what context are you referring to i imagine like your new win in apac i assume spreads are better in asia and outside the us and in the us so when you talk about pricing pressure where are you seeing it eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp mike its eric again i think we talk about pricing pressure because its just part of the natural course of events right we get a market we get pricing increasing increases from market upticks and then with clients they ask for a part of that back thats just how the business has operated as you say for the last years this quarter and last quarter and this year and for the rest of the year we expect pricing headwinds to be in line with the previous years in guidance weve said pricing headwinds of about per year were not seeing any more or any less of that it tends to be a little more geared towards the asset managers segment because those are the that is the group of clients that has mutual funds and some mutual fund versus etf shifting but its not were not seeing anything out of the ordinary or anything that is unexpected at this point mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then one last one to follow up on that i mean i guess maybe as goes your clients as goes any company or as goes state street and with the record high stock markets and historically such a strong position with the mutual funds which you just mentioned are you seeing that uptick or is it still a slog for your big longonly asset managers that are your legacy strength ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp mike its ron let me take that i mean i think that the as you would know as well as anybody the business continues to change and weve seen the continued move from the mutual fund to the etf to the sma but youre state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 also seeing these firms particularly the wellmanaged ones respond and theyre responding in a couple of ways i mean one new product types i mean even the most traditional mutual fund companies now have pretty interesting etf lines most of if theyre involved in the dc 401k business theyve got a mutual fund offering but theyve got a collective trust offering too so theyre responding to that market pressure most of them are figuring out ways to participate in the wealth business and we continue to respond and support them in that so the nature of the business is changing in some cases some things were more lucrative than others and so what youre also finding in those businesses is theyre very focused on their cost base their technology stack their operating stack and again that presses in our favor as we think about the alpha fronttoback solution were the largest middle office provider by far in the industry and weve gotten quite good at that so we describe ourselves as an essential partner to our clients and i think that plays through both in supporting them in their revenue and product activities as well as their cost and operations mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator your next question comes from vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks eric i just have a quick followup trying to understand your nii guidance if i look at your us interest bearing deposit costs linkedquarter they actually declined did you actually start cutting rates or was there something else that drove that can you give some color on that and is that likely to continue eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp vivek its eric i would describe that as just part of the normal volatility that well see in deposits i mean we run such a large franchise and our clients transactional activity tends to vary over time but were seeing healthy levels of deposits across dollars across euros and so we didnt we havent seen anything particularly surprising in one area or another i think total us interestbearing deposits if you look at our addendum are up slightly euros are up slightly and so on and so forth so and to the extent that there are some movements not driven by our pricing actions per se in truth clients need a certain amount of transactional deposits to fund their custody accounts and the pricing tends to be something that we have negotiated and is well understood now given where we are in the cycle and isnt the determinant of movements at this point vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator your next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 good morning guys ron you mentioned in one of your answers about the servicing and management fees that foreign exchange activity the volatility was actually quite low relative to history can you share with us what drove that and then second what macro factors should we keep an eye on to see to drive that volatility higher as we go forward especially in view of the geopolitical environment were all living in ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp well ill start but eric runs this business so ill quickly turn it over to him but i think if whats caused it i mean theres been really remarkably low dollar volatility and i think some of the things that have been driving that one is just the simple strength of the dollar for an awfully long time and its almost become too dangerous a thing to bet against the dollar and so even in times where you would expect to see some volatility we simply havent we havent seen that so i think thats been the primary driver of that that youve got this inordinate strength of the dollar but eric why dont i turn it over to you eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp gerard i think to add to that maybe in two ways the dollar has been strong and continues to be the dominant currency globally for whether its petrol whether its for core commodities and the currency of choice and while weve seen ebbs and flows and potential substitution euros won et cetera none of that has really come to pass and so you have a bit of a stabilizing factor i think the other thing that weve seen recently is because the clients have been underweight im sorry overweight in cash and underweight in equities and bonds and theyve started to put more of that cash to work theyre doing that both in the us and abroad and internationally and as a result theres not were not seeing a lot of speculation in currency markets were seeing more ill describe it as natural and transitional flows and so weve not seen disruptions on one hand knock on wood and on the other hand we have seen consistent holding of dollars and consistent buying of other currencies and so thats created it feels like a set of muted volatility levels that are fine for clients and our point of view is we need to serve clients during those times and the more we can offer them ways to trade through us through our multiple venues some of them are platforms some of them are single dealers some of them are multidealer and then some of them are algos well continue to do that and well support them and thatll because of the higher volumes were seeing notwithstanding the lower volatilities has been fruitful and helped drive revenue growth for us in that area gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for that color and circling back you both touched on onboarding was slower than expected in the first half of the year but you expect it to pick up as we go forward what caused the slowerthan expected onboarding in the earlier part of this year ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp eric its ron excuse me gerard its ron ill take that its concentrated in some large clients that also happen to be development partners and i think weve talked about this concept of development partners these are early partners that joined us in this journey and were doing a fair amount of development around that so thats state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2024 caused some of it and then some of it has been idiosyncratic to those same institutions in terms of things going on in their own operation that have delayed some of the onboarding so thats been a big part of it the second thing thats been driving it has been really around private markets while weve continued to bring on the clients and were really pleased with our offering and the clients that weve brought on the whole slowdown in private markets is actually affecting us because we start to get paid right when the fund starts to draw capital and invest and if youve been following this many of the new funds that have been raised including some of the very very largest ones actually havent drawn capital so weve got them set up and ready to go but were not actually deriving meaningful revenues from that yet so that would be the other major factor thats going on here gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator there are no further questions at this time ron please continue ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer state street corp well thanks everybody for joining us operator this
