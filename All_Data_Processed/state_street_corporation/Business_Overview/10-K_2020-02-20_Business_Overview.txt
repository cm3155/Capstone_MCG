institutions average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period for larger institutions such as state street bank assessments are determined based on regulatory ratings and forwardlooking financial measures to calculate the assessment rate which is subject to adjustments by the fdic and the assessment base the

status of any banking subsidiary in certain instances we would be required to guarantee the performance of a capital restoration plan if one of our banking subsidiaries were undercapitalized support of subsidiary banks under federal reserve regulations a bank holding company such as our parent company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries

subsidiary in circumstances in which we otherwise might not do so absent such a requirement in the event of bankruptcy any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a banking subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and will be entitled to a priority payment insolvency of an insured us subsidiary depository institution if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an fdicinsured us subsidiary depository institution such as state street bank upon its insolvency or certain other events the fdic has the ability to transfer any of the depository institutions assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institutions creditors enforce the terms of the depository institutions contracts pursuant to their terms or repudiate or disaffirm contracts or leases to which the depository institution is a party additionally the claims of holders of deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including claims of debt holders of the institution and under current interpretation depositors in nonus branches and offices in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver as a result such persons would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in us offices of the depository institution cyber risk management in october the federal reserve fdic and occ issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their thirdparty service

internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness in addition the proposal contemplates more stringent standards for institutions with systems that are critical to the financial sector although the fdic and occ in each withdrew the advance notice of proposed rulemaking the federal reserve has not withdrawn the advance notice and may still propose such a rule further discussion of cybersecurity risk management is provided in information technology risk management included in our managements discussion and analysis in this form 10k economic
