fantastic progress in one year and i would say to you generally if you liked our company a year ago you should love us now as we go through this information were going to be completely transparent but as you would expect its going to be messy we dont know all that you want to know but our pledge to you is that over the next quarter or two well give you more and more as we go along some of the highlights which you probably already know but we did successfully closed the deal on december and this is interestingly largest financial transaction institution transaction in years and these two iconic companies have 275plus combined years of service which is huge we are the sixth largest us commercial bank we have the number two weighted average deposit market share in our top msas and were about billion in assets truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 i think very very importantly before legal day which is less than days ago we had all managers in place entire organizational structure today is set and running no confusion about whos doing what so thats a really really big deal weve done a lot of work with regard to our culture ill talk about that in a moment but it feels really really good and weve made much progress in other areas i want to spend just a minute on culture because this is the most important consideration for all of us culture drives longterm performance there is no question about that and therefore it is our number one priority the way we think about culture is that culture is a function of our purpose our mission and our values there are certain practices the kind of way we do things around here and theres a whole process of embedding the culture into the organization but the most important thing to think about is our purpose our mission and our values our purpose at truist is to inspire and build better lives and communities we really believe we can make the world better and we think that is exactly what major corporations are called upon to do today we execute our purpose through our mission which is focusing on taking care of our clients through a really good environment for our teammates and of course optimizing longterm value for all of our stakeholders most importantly all of our mission efforts are guided by our longstanding deep beliefs which we call values our values at truist are about being trustworthy we serve with integrity its about being caring we know that everyone and every moment matters its about one team coming together we can accomplish anything working together as a team its about success we know that when our clients win we all win and for our teammates its about happiness a sense of positive energy changes lives and we ultimately want all of our teammates to be happy because when youre happy you dont have a job you have a passion and we want everybody to be passionately focused on accomplishing our purpose we know that were very very closely aligned early on in this process we got really good research from our teammates for example early on we gave them words to describe their companies we got over responses from each side they all picked exactly the same four words couple months later we had scientific research where we asked again over teammates divided between the companies to describe the company in terms of how we operate and they described it almost exactly the same just week before last weve started a series of town halls where bill rogers and i went around and started talking to our teammates and answering questions week before last we did of next week well do another or and i will tell you that the responses are fantastic our teammates are excited they love our culture they love our purpose they love our brand they love our colors they love our logo so it is off to a really really good start but i want you to feel confident as investors that this is not two companies struggling trying to come together this is two companies that were already deeply aligned in terms of our purpose our mission and our values everything weve seen over the last year affirms just that and now theres a renewed level of excitement from everybody as we think about coming together as truist and going out and making the world a better place lets talk about some of the highlights if youre following along on page total taxableequivalent revenue was billion adjusted net income available to common shareholders was billion and thats up but like all these numbers you got to know that they obviously inflated because of the suntrust impact on the bbt numbers as we added days towards the end of the fourth quarter so we wont dwell so much on the specific changes but we did make over billion truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 in terms of diluted earnings per share adjusted is and i will give you some detail in terms of how that adjustment was arrived at return on average assets adjusted very strong return on average tangible common equity which right out of the shoot is really really good again on adjusted basis and adjusted efficiency ratio is both companies to give you a sense of momentum grew loans at a healthy pace when you ex out some restructuring which daryl will talk about but underlying growth is very good the pipelines are very strong and we feel very very good about momentum asset quality is great and weve taken some actions to optimize the portfolio from a credit perspective our capital and liquidity levels are excellent daryl will give you detail about that our businesses as i said have good momentum we talked to bankers all across the footprint pipelines are strong people are excited about doing business with truist the launching of the truist brand colors logo could not have gone better i want you to know that we are primarily focused on serving our clients we are laserfocused on making sure our clients have a distinctive outstanding and service quality relationship with truist were going to talk about cost saves and daryl will give you a lot of detail that we have available for that but i want you to know from my perspective we have made a decision to slow the timing down just a few months and we did that to improve client service quality to ensure strong client retention to improve the longterm value proposition this is about really the digital investments that were going to be making when you get some of those made before we actually roll out the conversion and so the branch conversions are delayed some a part of that was because of the agreement we reached with regulators part of that was because we wanted to delay it some to make sure again we have a digital value proposition in place still we are very very confident on our net billion in savings so this should not be viewed as a negative this is the positive its the same number weve simply taken just a little bit longer to make sure we do it and do it right our nonperforming assets were fantastic at and net chargeoffs were right in the sweet spot of what weve always indicated at and a very strong common equity tier capital of so we feel really really good about asset quality and capital if you look at page ill just mention these selected items therere really just three that are large the merger related restructuring charges are million of pretax which is negative impact on diluted eps we have security losses because of our balance sheet restructuring that was million which translates into about in terms of negative impact on the eps and then we have some expenses that are not technically from an accounting point of view designated as mergerrelated but they are incremental operating expenses they do have future benefit but theyre not part of our ongoing run rate so you can kind of think about them the same the main thing is they dont impact future run rate so when you add all that together you get a net negative impact on our ongoing run rate of which is substantially why you see the difference in gaap and our adjusted numbers if you look at page just a few comments with regard to loans we did have an endofperiod balance of about billion really good mix the mix of loans held for investment consisted of commercial consumer about credit card so pretty balanced over time you might expect to see the consumer grow a little faster than commercial to get a little closer to but we feel really good about where we are starting out we did take some actions which daryl will give you more color on with regard to the portfolios but i would just point out that the yearend portfolio loans are a little bit inflated by about billion because of the loans that have moved into loans held for sale and theyre sold but havent closed yet so theyll close very very soon so as we think about the overall market just in talking to an awful lot of our regional presidents and market presidents i would say that the overall market is pretty good ceos are confident in their businesses but in truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 fairness they are nervous theyre worried about the macro issues the trade war iran the coronavirus were plus years long into recovery so while we do not expect a recession in the near term i would say in fairness we could sort of talk ourselves into one so its a little bit of a nervous period right now i think we need to be honest about that but thats one of the reasons that truist always remains strong in terms of capital and liquidity in the event these existential factors do create an interruption in terms of ongoing business but we dont really predict one now we really think this will settle down we certainly hope and pray that this coronavirus does not get out of hand but we all have to be really concerned about that there are a lot of people around the world being hurt a lot of people are dying and weve got to really hope that that does not become a global systemic issue and i personally dont think it will but we have to pay a lot of close attention to that if youre looking at slides on page just a couple of comments with regard to deposits we did end up with non interestbearing deposits of about billion and total deposits of about billion if you exclude the purchase accounting noninterest deposits declined just a little bit in the third quarter everybody i believe is seeing a continued shift out of noninterest into time and weve seen the same thing its not any different than anybody else is facing but our interest deposits did increase a strong so you can see whats going on our total deposit activity is very good its just a little shift going on we have strong noninterest deposits that total one of the best in the industry so we feel good about that our total cost of average total deposits and average interestbearing deposits respectively decreased basis points in so actually pretty good there given the relatively flat yield curve were very happy to report that we are telegraphing to our clients that virtually all of our clients will not experience any change in their account numbers having been involved in lots and lots of mergers over my career i can tell you that the big issue for the client is change and the main thing about change is dont change my account number so weve worked out a way and i congratulate our people for virtually all of our clients not to have any changes in their account numbers so we predict that it will go extraordinarily smoothly for our clients which is certainly our goal so overall even though its a little hard to see through the numbers our balance sheet is strong strong earnings tremendous progress in moving truist forward and were very excited and were very confident with that let me turn it to daryl and hell give you a lot more detail and a lot more color daryl n bible chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp thank you kelly and good morning everyone turning to slide net interest income was billion net interest margin was up basis points versus the third quarter purchase accounting contributed basis points to reported net interest margin at the end of the year our final purchase accounting marks included billion against the suntrust loan portfolio an million upward adjustment to cds and a million upward adjustment to longterm debt these marks were close to the recent estimates that we provided based upon september data we plan to trueup these marks in the first quarter as the final valuation numbers come in from our thirdparty provider core net interest margin was down basis points from the third quarter the yield on loans held for investment decreased basis points as the effect of lower shortterm rates was partially offset by a basis point benefit from purchase accounting the balance sheet restructuring improved our securities yield by basis points and achieved our goal of a relatively neutral interest rate risk profile truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 continuing on slide this summarizes our balance sheet restructuring which is focused on improving credit quality liquidity interest rate sensitivity net interest margin and return on capital through the restructuring we improved the run rate on the investment portfolio built liquidity to meet our lcr requirements rehedged the balance sheet and managed towards a more neutral interest rate position we sold loans to manage negative convexity reduced premium amortization and enhanced credit quality by exiting billion of highrisk credit exposures of which million was funded at yearend about of that sale traded in january through the end of january we lowered interest rates on about billion of institutional deposits by basis points because of our higher credit ratings we will continue to be opportunistic in optimizing other funding to take advantage of truists higher credit ratings we also estimate that yearend loans held for sale were elevated relative to normalized levels by approximately billion and that the securities were elevated by approximately billion this means the balance sheet should settle slightly under billion in total assets turning to slide noninterest income increased million after excluding million in security losses and million in losses related to the transfer of residential mortgages held for sale approximately million of the increase was due to the merger the rest was due to a million increase in insurance income due to seasonality and minor changes in heritage bbt fee income categories of note full year insurance income had organic growth of continuing on slide noninterest expense was up million after excluding million increase in merger and restructuring charges and million increase in incremental operating expenses related to the merger approximately million of this was due to core expenses from the merger the remaining increase was due to million in heritage bbt incentives and million in amortization due to higher cdi and other intangibles turning to slide asset quality remained strong npas increased million to million the increase was due to the merger and included million of acquired nonperforming loans held for sale million of loans and leases held for investment and million of foreclosed real estate partially offset by the sale of million of nonperforming mortgages npls were basis points of total loans held for investment at the end of the year down from basis points at september a decrease in the ratio was mostly due to the effect of accounting for acquired npls on a pooled basis in pci this effect on the ratio will reverse with the adoption of cecl and the transition of pooled level accounting for pci net chargeoffs increased million and were basis points of average loans down basis point from last quarter the provision increased million due to higher net chargeoffs and an increase in the provision for unfunded commitments our allowance was basis points of loans held for investment at yearend down from basis points at september due to the elimination of the suntrust allowance we would note that the combination of our allowance and unamortized fair value mark is a very robust of total loans the allowance recovery ratios also remained strong at times net chargeoffs and times npls continuing on slide effective january truist adopted cecl the new accounting standard related to credit losses as a result this did not impact our financial results however the impact at adoption was an overall billion increase in the allowance for credit losses the magnitude of this increase was significantly impacted by purchase accounting related to the merger we were not required to carry allowance on the acquired loans from the transaction at yearend due to the related purchase accounting marks excluding the impact of purchase accounting the implementation of cecl resulted in an approximate increase in the allowance for credit losses this reflects increases that are related to our consumer and mortgage portfolios partially offset by the decrease in our commercial loan portfolio in terms of capital the increase in the truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 allowance due to cecl resulted in a billion aftertax reduction to retained earnings truist has elected to face any impact to regulatory capital by annually from through turning to slide our capital ratios decrease due to the merger but remained strong relative to regulatory capital levels for wellcapitalized banks our cet1 ratio was down from in the third quarter the benefits of purchase accounting will be partially offset in the first quarter by a basis point impact from the treatment of msr riskweighted assets under the simplification rule and a basis point impact from the cecl phasein at december tangible book value per share increased from september earnings during the quarter contributed of the increase and the merger with suntrust contributed confirming the close was accretable to tangible common equity compared to december tangible book per share increased continuing to slide we realized may be challenging to analyze and model so we are providing more guidance than usual our guidance is largely dollarbased due to the absence of historical baselines to which growth rates can be applied some highlights from our first quarter guidance includes average earning assets to be plus or minus billion we expect reported net interest margin to be in the mid to high3 and core margin to be just over net chargeoffs should range from basis points to basis points and fee income should be just over billion our expense guidance includes million to million in merger expenses for the full year we expect the balance sheet to grow based upon our guidance net chargeoffs should remain relatively stable particularly no significant deterioration in the economy and expenses will trend down each quarter until we achieve an annual runrate expense savings of about million in the fourth quarter turning to slide we are also providing mediumterm performance targets for about three years we are confident truist can generate peerleading return on tangible common equity in the low and an adjusted efficiency ratio in the low over the medium term in terms of capital we are targeting cet1 ratio for we are also confident we will achieve billion in net expense savings through but we are updating the expected timing of our expense net savings this is primarily due to our commitment to the regulators not to close overlapping branches for the at least the first year and careful and cautious approach to systems integration to minimize client disruption by the end of we expect to achieve a run rate equal to of our net cost savings target by the end of and by the end of a full billion all of this will drive positive operating leverage for the next three years for reference combined noninterest expense excluding merger expenses a onetime charitable contribution and amortization was approximately billion we expect to achieve an annual run rate of investment of approximately million by the fourth quarter of these investments will be directed towards personnel branding digital and technology now let me turn it back to kelly for an update on the merger and closing thoughts and qa kelly s king chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks daryl so if you take a look at page just to summarize just a lot of really really good accomplishments so far we also closed the deal weve integrated the financial reporting system weve integrated and converted derivatives workday a number of other systems we have successfully retained our talent and our clients any concern about any mass exodus on that is not warranted weve restructured the balance sheet weve launched our visual imagery colors and logo weve introduced our culture purpose truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 mission and values and im happy to say weve added some key leadership in certain areas particularly in the digital space so kind of whats coming up in a big picture perspective is that we are now working hard on completing the product mapping which allows then to go into the development we will be continuing to complete another town halls well be doing about next week so that continues on well continue to focus on deepening our relationship with our clients we will complete the branch divestitures in a few months we will complete the purchase of our new truist center headquarters here in charlotte i just mentioned that because thats a pretty big deal in this market and for our people our people are really excited about being in a 47story iconic building that shows well in charlotte well be introducing and marketing our truist brand and well continue investments in digital and technology and then well phasein to the conversion of the primary systems so overall it was a very strong quarter as we said a year ago we have two great companies coming together to create a very special company we are in great markets we have great economics we have a very strong culture everyone is excited about our purpose we have the opportunity to make the world a better place you got to love truist so ill turn it back over to rich richard baytosh directorinvestor relations truist financial corp thank you kelly lauren at this time if youd come back on the line and explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning kelly good morning daryl kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hi good morning gerard daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc kelly and bill congratulations on doing a monumental deal and coming out of the gates with some really good numbers congratulations truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thank you william henry rogers a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp thank you we appreciate that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc daryl can you share with us on the credit side the provision for the guidance for seems pretty robust did cecl have an impact on what you guys are looking for because considering that you marktomarket all those loans at the time of closing without cecl i would have maybe expected the provision maybe to be a little lower daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp yeah gerard so we basically adopted fasbs guidance on how cecl operates our auditors pwc feel very comfortable with what weve booked on of in essence if you back out the purchase accounting its a increase of the two banks combined were both around million or million allowance were up to about million if you add in reserve for unfunded its about million but then thats what the guidance basically told us to do and thats why we booked that i do agree though there is a doubledipping there i mean that is definitely positive because we have purchase accounting marks of billion on the suntrust loan portfolio and now we have a reserve at million on their loan book as well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then kelly and bill when you guys on slide you listed your accomplishments so far and now the next steps can you share with us how challenged are the is the heaviest lifting ahead of us or has it already been accomplished can you compare and contrast what youve already accomplished with what you still need to do in terms of the degree of difficulty kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good question gerard ill take a start and then bill can add to that i would say in all honesty the heaviest lifting youve done because pulling two companies together early on to make sure that you dont have any cultural interruption that you dont have any clashes in business strategies that you should still feel confident in terms of achieving the expense saves all of those are we feel better today than we felt a year ago i have to say it for myself and i think bill will echo this a week before last when we visited town halls we talked to about teammates and if youd have been in that room number one youve had said these people have been working together for years and number two youd have felt the level of excitement was just extraordinarily high and so mezz work has got to be done with regard to programming and then taking the thing away from that theres really really truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 hard work but at this point the organization is settled strong focused and we are just now focusing on doing the connectivity work that is big but is predictable in terms of how well we can do it bill william henry rogers a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp yeah i think kelly and i looked at this through the same lens in terms of whats hard and whats easy and the hard part and the most important part is getting the cultural alignment and making sure that they are and i think kelly has articulated that really well and i feel exact same way and if that wasnt there then that would be some concern and that would make the road ahead harder so i think weve set a really good foundation for the road ahead thats not to diminish the fact we have a lot of work so weve got a lot of systems integration to do and revenue synergies to achieve and all of those things but what i think we would align on is the highest hurdle is it working and is the company culture aligned and are we leaning forward and i feel great about that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc again thank you and congratulations kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thank you operator well take our next question from saul martinez with ubs saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everybody congratulations on your first quarters combined entity a couple of questions first on your marks and in the outlook for purchase accounting accretion i think the mark is about billion not too different from in your last five and daryl can you just walk us through whether that calculation has changed at all with regards to how much of its credit liquidity and rate marks and the purchase accounting accretion trajectory as well if you can talk to that because i think this your guidance implies about i think billion of purchase accounting accretion this year how does that move forward also beyond how do we think about the glide path of paa and how it impacts numbers beyond this year daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp yeah thank you for the question saul so first i would tell you thats billion that was booked that were showing from december that will be marked about of it is credit related or it came down a little bit but its really closely aligned to i mean our cecl was reserve for unfunded was in the so its just a little bit more than that obviously due for a little bit different methodology but its very consistent from that impact the other part the other is mainly attributable to liquidity and interest rate risk we did put in one of the slides that the commercial portfolio probably has an average life of around three years consumer around six i would say its going to ebb and flow of how contractual payments come through as well as prepayments you will definitely see a downward trajectory on the purchase accounting accretion thats coming truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 through but at the same time what youre going to see is our cost savings our net cost savings really kick in and over that same time period and you will actually still see improvement on a consistent basis on our operating leverage number just because the calculation of how efficiency works with expenses over revenue for every dollar we save its worth of revenue thats lost so we still feel very good about the projections that we gave from that perspective saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it and i guess a followup there adjusting for purchase accounting accretion the guidance implies about by my calculation about billion to billion of net interest income exing out paa if i look at the combined entity historically suntrust bbt the run rates been about billion can you just walk us through whats driving that difference i know theres a lot of balance sheet restructuring going on but it does seem to imply that the core nii theres some degradation there exing out the paa am i understanding this right can you just walk me through like whats driving that daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp yeah i mean if you really look at the balance sheet restructuring we didnt shrink that much i mean the mark was billion so the loans didnt sell we just basically wrote down the loans we did sell mortgages mortgages if you look at it over the last couple of quarters is down about billion but pretty much everything else is consistent the big reason why nii is down if you go back a year ago and you looked at like what we were projecting our models and all of our peers models had interest rates still rising at the start of and we actually went back and did a little homework we looked at what estimates were back then and we compare them to what estimates are right now and across the board the peer average is down basis points to basis points and thats just because of the lower rate environment and the flatter curve that youre seeing saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay so its really just the rate backdrop ph versus degraded nii daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp correct saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc all right i mean i guess i get that but like even if i look at the third quarter daryl combined nii pro forma was about billion or billion annualized so this quarter i guess theres some degradation there but it seems like a pretty big drop off daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp you had margin in the second half of really start to hit as the rate cuts truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp came in they started in july and you had three drops so you really arent seeing the full impact the last drop was in december so you arent getting to see full impact until you get to the first quarter so you have to look at that trajectory that weve seen over the last six months saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right well fair enough thanks a lot operator well take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning thanks for the update on some of the kind of planned milestones that we should be focusing on on page but i guess i want to focus on just the systems conversions and what are the big ones that we should be thinking about that will drive the cost saves and it seems like banks have done a pretty good job converting various systems in recent deals ph it can always be a risk so whats the timeframe for some of the bigger systems conversions and i guess just what should we be looking for to make sure they go well kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so matt clearly the biggest is the overall deposit conversion because thats what drives the interaction with the clients loan conversion is a big deal obviously i would say those are the two larger ones we have about programs that have to be dealt with ecosystems so theres a lot of them but its like any other bank the primary is loans and deposits matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and the timing of those conversions kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp sorry daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp timing of the conversions truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc timing kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp oh timing so we will be primarily shooting for about august of that may seem like a long time but were committed to doing it right much work is already underway in terms of ecosystem selection thats virtually all done we are moving into programming now the programming takes several months then you have a huge amount of time of testing you could do it sooner and we could beat that a little bit but the key is to take plenty of time for testing because you only know through testing if youve done it right and you dont want to put it out there and then go back and have to change it so if i had to give you a specific date now id give you like august of matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then separately daryl if you look at i guess at slide here the outlook for the first quarter and the full year it implies relatively stable earning assets throughout the year i mean it sounds like theres some kind of inflated assets at yearend and held for sale in the securities book that presumably will run off i would think relatively quick so what im getting at is im trying to think about the loan growth that youre assuming for the rest of the year or maybe along with those kind of inflated assets runoff in the first quarter daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp yeah so matt what i would say is i mean the trajectory of loans coming off of the books mainly mortgages was down third fourth quarter weve bottomed out most of the trades have settled now just a little bit left to go this quarter but when you look at pointtopoint when weve presented to our board earlier this week our operating plan on a go forward basis were looking to be a little bit better than growth in gdp so i would say in the to range pointtopoint in loans over the next year and favored a little bit heavier in commercial versus retail but i think we have as kelly said momentum that we finished with the year fourth quarter and the teams are working really well together and feel very positive that were going to grow and generate revenue as we move forward in matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator our next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc on the slowing of the timing of the cost saves of the factors that you said what was the biggest driver because i just assumed a lot of the drivers that you said like sort of focusing on service quality the customer retention the digital thats stuff that you would have already assumed that you would have been doing so what was the change what surprised you to make that change thanks kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so john its not really a surprise but it is a difference we were very committed to picking the best of the systems and so we went systembysystem to look at the best and we picked a number of suntrust systems which are really really good and surviving through a system so its a little technical but if you took all of the bbt systems you can convert this much faster you just move all of the data from suntrust over to bbt programs but when you pick the suntrust system and you put it onto bbt equipment you have equipment changes and you have the programming to move that suntrust program over to the bbt systems thats really whats driving the time a bit longer than wed thought but its also a conservative estimate with regard to testing because were committed to doing an awful lot of testing and then remember when we first talked about our timing we did not anticipate the branch delay which you alluded about but that is the year of delayed savings it was the right thing to do in conjunction with the approval of the process we feel good about it we will be doing closings during the course of the year in non overlapping markets we will be doing a lot of work through our retail channel in terms of preparing for the closings but thats a pretty material change in terms of the timing of the process john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay thats helpful kelly thanks and then separately back to your outlook on slide it looks like the share count outlook isnt showing a change so is that implying that youre not assuming buybacks in and if so could you give us the rationale for that daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp we basically said when we announced the merger were going to run at a cet1 ratio until we got through some of the integrations and took some of the risks off the table so we are starting off targeting when we do our ccar ph ask our ccar ask that will be coming up in the next couple of months we will build in capacity such that if we decide to change that and decide to target something less than that after we have some success well have the ability to do that but right now were sticking to truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay got it all right thank you operator well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well the delay in the branch closing is not really new i guess you just updated the numbers because you said that like almost six months ago so im just trying to understand better the outlook for expenses so you look to take the efficiency ratio from down to what like or over three years that implies a lot of positive operating leverage so i guess the real question is look do you expect positive operating leverage in and as part of that i mean if youre delaying some of the branch closures and the deposit money conversions arent until august what are the expense savings that you can get more in the near term such as backoffice or anything else thanks kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so we are expecting positive operating leverage really for the next three years so thats a really really good story there are a lot of savings that we will get remember again the overlapping branches closings are deferred there are a number of branch closings that are not in overlapping areas that are going to be closed in the near term in addition to that just because we dont close certain branches and overlapping years it doesnt mean we dont produce expenses in those areas some of these branches are literally sidebyside and there are commonalities in terms of staffing that we can integrate even though there are two separate branches and so there will be cold space in the branches even before the branches are actually closed so there are a lot of areas to be honest theres still a lot of backroom areas that are not related to the branches that we have overlapping and staffing we didnt deal with all of that day one as time goes on we will have additional overlapping redundancy and staffing that we will be reducing so its kind of a hodgepodge to be honest but its pretty clear to see what weve laid out we think with this modification in terms of the expected timeframe with regard to saving we feel very very confident well be able to accomplish that daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp hey mike if you look on page on the noninterest expense page that we have the first five categories that you have there personnel all the way down to the equipment expense i would expect those expense items to decrease over the next three years this year personnel will drop we did went through our first risks more on the management level when we closed the transaction our sourcing group is working aggressively with our third party vendor supplier so we will get savings in those areas and while not a lot of branches to date wont close this year were working very aggressively in all the major markets in the midatlantic and southeast to really focus and consolidate our buildings in all the metropolitan areas and that should come online middle to end of so we feel very good that were going to get the cost savings in and in the next three years truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and so just maybe you dont want to answer the question youre not giving that guidance so when we go at the year should revenue growth exceed expense growth or is this really just all backended to years two and three daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp i believe were going to have positive operating leverage every year we cant promise it every quarter because of the seasonality but every year we will generate positive operating leverage from to to and to mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just a separate followup question it sounds like you really are planning to have a strong long term company youve said that youre taking a very measured approach i guess just maybe a little bit more from bill on the old suntrust side kind of what are you seeing thats not going as well as you expected that you could do better and then maybe kelly you could chime in too kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp honestly everything is going really well and i dont have any area that id say is not going as well expected there are a lot of areas that are going much better to be honest the integration of our people and our teams whether its our corporate and institutional group or our community bank all of those are integrating extraordinarily well so personally i see some real upside in terms of revenue momentum particularly because of how well our teams are working together ive had a chance to visit bills had a chance to visit with a lot of our teams in the last days especially and again you walk around the room you would not be able to detect that this was two companies just having come together you think theyd all been working together for a long time william henry rogers a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp yeah mike id say just we entered it in with some good momentum kelly outlined some good loan momentum and legacy suntrust coming into that there was good loan momentum in bbt as well so thats carrying over into the early weeks of the year on the investment banking side and the relationship and the teamwork thats going on with the commercial community bank its just off the charts i mean i feel really good about that i mean of course were one month in but the things that you want to see in terms of pipelines and teamwork and all that i feel really good about so i think generally just strong momentum in the businesses heading into the merger mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 thanks operator our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning i wanted to ask a bit about on the credit side and daryl you mentioned that youre going to redo the marks again were going through cecl i assume thats in your provision guidance can you help us understand when we moved to the pcd and nonpcd within the basis points to basis points of chargeoffs how much of legacy suntrust chargeoffs are we going to see in that number and is there any room where just the the math ends up looking better than the guidance just because of how the mechanics of the chargeoff recognition works with half the bookmarks daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp yeah so ken what i would say is that our guidance between basis points and basis points we believe we can be within that range and so theres a little bit of uncertainty in the marketplace right now so we widened the range out a little bit suntrust portfolio is performing very well we have good marks on it we did sell a few credits nothing of substance but we did sell some that we wanted to just dispose of but for the most part their credit profile is really strong as well so i wouldnt say thered be any impact when we do convert from pci to pcd there will be about million that will basically come out of the purchase accounting mark and go into the allowance out of the million that we have allocated to it thats a little bit of a nuance but thats just how the cecl accounting plays out i dont know if clarke you want to add anything clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah i dont see any big changes things look very stable right now in our guidance around the range it depends on the economy and also how fast some of our consumer segments grow weve got a lot of attractive higher margin consumer opportunities now between the two companies so it is really dependent upon the mix and the economy but as far as stability of asset quality right now and our outlook it looks good ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and my follow up just on provision versus chargeoffs on this point you have the wider range of charge offs but i guess is it fair to say that the provision pretty much matches if you just look at your fullyear guidance versus what the chargeoffs guide implies for losses just the moving parts between provision and chargeoffs thatd be helpful thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp so ill start and clarke can chip in but in essence our provision estimate is assuming chargeoffs and then all of our assumptions within cecl as you heard from all of our peers the models are more complex now so you have to look at the market environment quiet behavior theres a lot more variables that you have here were truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 assuming all that is static were assuming were going to grow the portfolio and our assumption is is that mix stays the same obviously all that is not going to be static like that but thats whats built into the assumption clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah ken the way i think about it is were going to incrementally provide above chargeoffs generally at the reserve rate assuming no big change in our seasonal assumptions so youd assume the provisions larger than chargeoffs ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you guys kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp okay operator operator instructions well take our next question from erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch my first question is on synergies once again so very strong statement and positive operating leverage over the next three years im wondering if that includes any revenue synergies and how should we think about revenue synergies going forward the organic growth in insurance is particularly impressive given that the company was combined for only days clearly that didnt have any impact so i wanted to understand what the revenue opportunities for the combined company are and also the other question on that on the cost side daryl could you tell us about the pacing during the year in and of the cost savings realization please kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so erika we feel and bill alluded to this we feel very very good about the revenue synergies i mean really youve got to remind yourself of how synergistic this combination is i mean suntrust has a fantastic corporate institutional group program fantastic wealth management strategies fantastic national consumer finance business all of which are complementary can be leveraged over bbt or client base likewise you alluded to the insurance opportunity from bbt side and the bbt community bank has a broader reach than the suntrust community bank reach has so theyll be able to expand some of the programs that the bbt community bank had into the suntrust bank so all of that which is of course not factored into our truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 numbers is net very positive and accretive we cant give you numbers on that today because its hard to really give you meaningfully accurate numbers but intuitively from talking to our people we know that all of those businesses are very synergistic have huge opportunity and early response from our people in terms of executing on that is outstanding now insurance you talked about is real and very easy to kind of talk about so lets ask chris to talk about that in a minute christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp yeah erika i might just also mention to play off of both bill and kellys comments on the community bank and the cib working together just a couple of tangible thoughts when both companies and i sat down to actually design the model we actually designed in the community bank embedded in the community bank about folks that are capital markets industry specialists corporate finance specialists their sole purpose in life is to integrate with the regional presence a of those to share the client base of bbt with those individuals and we have for example just since december seven deals that would be sizeable enough that would get your attention that we have been involved in with the client and we have commitments on three of those now seven deals doesnt make a future but seven deals in about days of that nature i think is pretty good both teams i can tell you from having sat in the regional presidents meetings are exceptionally excited and its a natural gravitation and ill just ill leave it at that but its been very very effective to kellys point on the insurance side two years ago we really said we want to transform this business and we brought in a consultant really to kind of transform startup with a white sheet of paper i could not be more proud of what those guys have executed now weve set up initiatives were on plan were on our target to improve the ebitda just in two years for example weve increased our margin and weve got industryleading organic growth yeartodate and i will tell you the three things you want in place are in place weve got industryleading retention weve got pricings coming our way and its up another this quarter versus third and our new business production which is actually feet on the streets generating business is up and not in my career have i seen so all things go in the insurance brokerage business kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp then on the cost piece erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch the followup question yeah thank you kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i would just tell you its hard to call it on a quarterbyquarter basis were trying to give you target estimates what we would be at the end of each year probably what i would just stay with right now were only eight weeks into the merger well have more clarity well close the first fullmonth books next week so give us another quarter or two and well have more certainty down the road but i think we gave you good enough estimates and feel very confident were going to get the cost saves truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and just as a follow up i just wanted to make sure i understood how we should treat the purchase accounting over the three years so you mentioned that of the billion is credit and is liquidity and i guess the way i just understood the credit part of the mark is the not accretable difference which would not accrete on over nii and i just wanted to make sure i was thinking about it the right way or does all of the billion accrete back to nii daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp yeah so the nuance i mentioned this earlier im glad you called this out so out of the billion now that weve adopted cecl about million of it is going to go into the reserve its part of cecl so its in there now so its in essence having billion will accrete in as principal and cash flows come in from the assets and then the liabilities that you have over those terms erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you and great logo kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from brian klock with keefe bruyette woods brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning gentlemen kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp good morning brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc daryl i just have a quick follow up i just want to make sure that i understand the comments on the cet1 target and buybacks so even though the cet1 came in at which was a little bit lower end versus what you truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 guys initially thought the accretable yield thats coming through is coming in pretty fast so does it feel like your timing with the ccar submission that you guys would probably be able to buy back stock in the second half of the year does that still sound like thats on target daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp so brian yeah we did give guidance that this next quarter because of the msr change and rwa and then the cecl adoption our first quarter ending cet1 ratio will probably be relatively flat to what we have right now in the range after that i agree with you well start to build pretty quickly as we generate and accrete through the earnings power there its really a call on kelly and bills part and the boards part on when we start buyback right now were just sticking with the brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it ph thank you kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah so remember weve said very clearly that over the term some of these things settle down there is capital opportunity with regard to truist weve also said very clearly that during the first phase of our new truist life its really smart to be conservative i mean we have a lot of moving parts that need to settle down we have a lot of existential factors out in the world but wed know about that right now with whats breaking from a medical point of view so theres just a lot of sound reasoning in terms of being conservative now as those uncertainties settle down to your point in terms of the capital level we have in terms of the capital accretion that will occur predictably over the next several quarters there certainly could be the opportunity of some capital buybacks i wouldnt be surprised at all if that were to happen brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats helpful thank you appreciate it and daryl just one real quick follow up when i look at slide on the guidance for merger expenses for the full year the million to million the footnote doesnt include some of the incremental operating expenses related to the merger i guess how much is in that million to million related to these incremental operating expenses and can you just remind us what that means in light of the differentiation between the incremental operating and the other restructuring and merger charges daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp yeah brian so if you remember at ph bab i went through in detail the difference between what are normal merger and restructuring charges versus this incremental operating the main primary difference is our definition of merger and restructuring basically has no future benefit its due just to the transaction because of the size of this transaction and the magnitude there are a lot of things that we are doing that putting things together that will have some benefit so like in scotts area when were putting the systems together that he is working on in integration and the ecosystems a design around putting those ecosystems together well it has a future benefit were doing lots of that hundreds of millions of dollars of people working on that architecture that were putting those and calling truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 those out for the most part we have schedules in our tables that break out where to pull those numbers out but for the most part its in personnel and professional are were most of those charges exist as far as the breakdown goes its a high level estimate i would say about a third of it might be related to the moe and the operating the rest would probably be ph mercs is a ballpark here brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp but its going to be fluid its going to move back and forth brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right perfect thanks for your time appreciate it operator our next question comes from john mcdonald with autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi guys a couple of quick followups i guess just on the cet1 daryl if you dont do buybacks this year with the share count that youve guided to does that get you back up to the in your modeling by the end of the year are you roughly at or does it take you into to get back to that daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp our estimates right now we are plus or minus towards the end of the year it all depends on how fast the balance sheet grows and how the accretion comes in so theres a lot of variables there but were in the neighborhood of john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and just a followup on sauls question the purchase accounting is a nice boost for this year it seems like the difference between the core and noncore margin suggests something like billion or so of purchase accounting addition to nii this year does that fall off quickly next year does that like drop by or just any idea of the pace that that kind of scales down i know youve got the merger saves thatll kick in to offset it but whats the any idea on the pace of that daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp yeah we gave you the terms of try to how you would amortize it in it does fade away over the several year process so i think you have the right mindset of how to model it just know that as you model it and you factor in the cost saves you will see that you still drive positive operating leverage truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research right right okay last question on the page the investment the annualized investment of million what are you guys including in that and how are you characterizing like what kind of investments and why are you calling that out just give us some color on that daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp ill give a couple so our executive leadership team approved about more than doubling our digital teams that are out work now and theyre assigned to all the different business units working to making our improvements and enhancements for our client experience so that would be one in personnel there are some key hires that were putting out into the marketplace and more teams that have some skillsets that we dont have that were trying to get more of were starting to see some branding in dantes world marketing going back and forth so i dont know if anybody else wants to kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp the big one of those is the development of our innovation and technological center that has got a lot of excitement a lot of focus and pretty immediate investment in so that will be a big development during this year john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay william henry rogers a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp yeah thanks ill add on there commercial onboarding i mean its a list of dozens of things that were seeing that are weve got the capacity to do them theyre not opportunistic theyre really clientfriendly client focused and were calling it out because these are strategic investments that we think making now are going to really have an incredibly good longterm payback and deferring them for the point of meeting some quarter just doesnt make a lot of sense so thats the reason to put them in there and call them out john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay all right thanks bill thats helpful so when you guys talk about the merger stays at billion net thats the kind of investments that youre netting against that the merger saves john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research thats right daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp and i wouldnt expect the investments to stop at million truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research right daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp i mean our growth phase is well north of billion john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah okay thank you operator our next question comes from lana chan with bmo capital markets lana chan q analyst bmo capital markets united states hi good morning kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning lana chan q analyst bmo capital markets united states so one quick question on the preferreds dividend in the fourth quarter was there something unusual there and can you give us run rate for the quarters in daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp yeah lana we have a couple preferreds that are semiannual rather than quarterly i think thats the nuance that you have to factor in now when you look at the truist dividend payout schedule lana chan q analyst bmo capital markets united states but there was only million which was much lower than even i think the previous run rate daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp you remember though in the bbt world we retired one preferred and then we reissued another preferred i think the timing of all that basically had a favorable impact in the fourth quarter it should level out as we get into from a schedule but do you want to talk about this offline im sure myself or rich or aaron can handle that question for you truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 lana chan q analyst bmo capital markets united states okay great thank you and then just i wanted to confirm daryl that youve said before on the core run rate for the expenses through by the time we get to the fourth quarter with the cost savings that we should see a decline in the quarterly run rate through the year daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp yeah so we gave you if you make all the adjustments baseline for is billion we hear saying that our net cost savings for the fourth quarter of would be down to million which is annualized million run rate number which is and it will continue to build yearafteryear on that lana chan q analyst bmo capital markets united states okay thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp youre welcome operator our next question comes from stephen scouten with piper sandler stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hi good morning guys not to be the dead horse here but kind of thinking about the delayed expense savings im just wondering if i calculate that it seems like the indiscernible timing is about a year in and im wondering if theres any offsets that youve seen in terms of upside surprises from any sort of revenue realizations or otherwise as youve gotten into the deal so far daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp yeah stephen as you know we didnt factor in intentionally any of the revenue opportunities in this what youre seeing now is kind of the worst case in terms of the expense delay with no factored in revenue opportunities but as you just heard chris and bill say the revenue opportunities in commercial banking and private banking and insurance across the board are really very very substantial and its not something that will take like two years to get underway its underway as we speak so its a very conservative view to factor in the expense delay without factoring in the revenue enhancements but thats our nature we try to be conservative so wed rather beat than miss and so thats kind of the way weve tried to factor together stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then other question for me is just in terms of restructuring business units loan runoff and things of that nature is everything in your mind thats been completed here already are in the process of whats truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 remaining and held for sale or are there still other decisions to be made about additional business line exits potentially or other loans that you might look to take off the balance sheet daryl n bible a chief financial officer senior executive vice president truist financial corp yeah stephen well i would say for the most part were pretty much over with from a balance sheet restructuring perspective everything will settle that we wanted to move off this quarter and move forward from that perspective we still have our divestiture thats planned later in the year probably second quarter so that will come out of run rate when that occurs but i think for the most part we have pretty much everything done stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great thanks so much operator and well take our final question from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks i want to ask about compensation for the combined companies in terms of just retaining employees that you have is there anything unique that you are doing or that you intend to do just to keep competitors at bay and keep your team focused kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah chris weve been working on that from day one in terms of special compensation arrangements for key players and developing a very aggressive ongoing compensation program for all of our people whether in staff jobs or in revenue jobs i mean for example we did a bonus for like of our teammates that we just paid out in the last few months just as a thank you for their hard work and so yeah weve done a lot of particular activities to try to focus on that and so thats one of the reasons we feel very very confident in terms of our low attrition and in fact what were seeing is low attrition so everybody feels good weve done all the right things and we will remain aggressive in terms of taking care of our teammates because ultimately the way it emerges well or not is based on the teammates and again all of our teammates today feel very very good very very excited and very confident and again ill say again the attrition is very very low so we feel very good christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc all right kelly thank you bill and daryl for all the information this morning we
