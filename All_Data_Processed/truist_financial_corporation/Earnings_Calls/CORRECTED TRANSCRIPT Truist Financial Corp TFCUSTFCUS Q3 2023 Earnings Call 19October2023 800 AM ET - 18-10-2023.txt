executive officer truist financial corp thanks brad and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today now before we get into the third quarter results lets begin as always with our purpose on slide as we all know truist is a purposedriven company committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities id like to take a few minutes just to highlight some of the ways we demonstrated our purpose last quarter truist is driving positive change by supporting organizations that promote the growth and vibrancy of our communities in august we invested million to support affordable housing in charlotte and career development and economic mobility programs across the state of north carolina and just last week we announced our allocation of million in new market tax credits from the us treasurys community development financial institution fund this is the 12th time truist has received an award which has allowed us to invest million in underserved communities by providing loans with reduced rates of interest andor nontraditional terms over the years these loans have helped spark economic development and job growth in communities across the regions we serve im really proud of the meaningful work were doing as a company to have a positive effect on the lives of our clients our teammates and our communities and of course our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose now lets turn to some of the key takeaways on slide truist reported solid third quarter earnings that met our guidance despite certain discrete noninterest income and expense items that negatively impacted our results mike is going to cover those later in the call as you can see on the slide our solid performance was defined by several underlying key themes on our july earnings call we discussed our intent to significantly reduce the rate of expense growth at our company which was followed up with the introduction of our simplification efforts and million cost saves program in september were fully committed to delivering on this work and the reduction in third quarter expenses is evidence of the hard work thats been ongoing throughout the year were also managing our balance sheet more efficiently during the past few earnings calls ive described how were focusing on core clients reducing lower yielding portfolios and paying down higher cost borrowings all of which occurred during the third quarter and helped drive our nim higher by basis points during the quarter moreover these efforts have increased our cet1 ratio to nearly which is a level that we believe we can maintain throughout the proposed phasein period under pending basel iii rules based on our current rate of organic capital growth although asset quality is normalizing off historically low levels we are encouraged that our metrics remained relatively stable during the quarter while we continue to build our loan loss reserve considering the uncertain economic environment lastly were making strong progress on our cost saves program and organizational simplification which well discuss in more detail later in the call im pleased with our direction the intensity and focus and im confident in our ability to emerge as a stronger company while the quarter was solid we acknowledge theres more work to do as we strive to produce better and more consistent results in the future we view this third quarter performance as a step forward in that direction so lets do some more specific work on slide net income available to common shareholders was billion or per share mergerrelated and restructuring charges primarily related to severance associated with our cost saves program hurt eps by total revenue decreased as expected and was essentially in line with our guidance despite an million discrete impact to service charges on deposits revenue were also encouraged that our net interest margin improved basis points driven by our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts including a reduction in fhlb borrowings a decline in loweryielding loan balances and improving new and renewed loan spreads truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 adjusted expenses were down basis points and within our guidance range and would have decreased basis points excluding million of higherthannormal other expense average loans decreased primarily due to the sale of the student loan portfolio in the second quarter and our continued repositioning towards higher return core assets average deposits increased modestly as we continue to experience a remixing towards higheryielding alternatives we added basis points of cet1 capital in the quarter and increased our alll ratio by basis points in light of ongoing economic uncertainty lastly we maintained our strong quarterly common stock dividend at per share paid on september so lets move to our digital update on slide digital engagement trends at truist remain positive as you can see on the left side of the slide mobile app users have grown steadily over the past year and were currently focused on driving additional growth through our mobilefirst engagement initiative from an activity standpoint digital transactions increased relative to the fourth quarter last year driven primarily by zelle transactions which were up over the same period due to the rapid growth weve experienced digital has quickly become a preferred channel for interacting with truist in fact digital transactions now account for more than of total bank transactions and while thats certainly positive truist has a meaningful opportunity to shift the transaction mix even more towards digital specifically by leveraging what we call t3 which is this concept that touch and technology work together to create trust and that further enhances the client experience and drives greater digital adoption and efficiency as a proof point recent enhancements to the digital onboarding have helped drive a increase in truist one funding rates yeartodate which may in turn lead to additional balances and transaction activity with those new clients in sum truist has solid momentum in digital and im highly optimistic about the potential we have to leverage t3 to further expand our digital user base and drive transaction volume next im going to cover loans and leases on slide average loans decreased sequentially reflecting our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts including the sale of our student loan portfolio last quarter and further reductions in lower return portfolios excluding the student loan sale average loans were down average commercial loans decreased primarily due to a decrease in ci balances driven by lower revolver utilization and production lower ci production in our corporate and commercial banking segment reflected a combination of moderately lower demand due to economic uncertainty and greater pricing discipline which contributed to wider spreads on new production in commercial community bank in our consumer and credit card portfolios average loans decreased primarily due to the sale of our student loan portfolio and further reductions in indirect auto production consumer and card balances were down excluding the student loan sale residential mortgage was essentially flat relative to the prior quarter we do continue to experience growth in higher yielding portfolios especially sheffield and service finance loan production increased yearoveryear at sheffield and at service finance overall we expect average commercial and consumer balances to decline modestly in the fourth quarter driven by our ongoing mixed shift towards deeper client penetrations deeper relationships the emphasis of lower return portfolios and the effects of continued economic uncertainty lets move to the deposit trends on slide average deposits were flat sequentially although we continue to experience remixing within the portfolio as clients saw higher rate alternatives noninterestbearing deposits decreased and currently represent of total deposits compared to in the second quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year within our segments average deposits were down in corporate and commercial banking and relatively flat in consumer banking and wealth due to the effects of quantitative tightening and availability of higher rate alternatives truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 we continue to deepen our relationships with consumer banking and wealth clients especially in payments net new checking account production has been positive for three quarters in a row were also seeing solid adoption of our flagship truist one checking product in addition small business deposits were up sequentially and august was the strongest month for net new small business checking account production in the last three years deposit costs continue to rise during the third quarter though at a slower pace interestbearing deposit cost increased basis points sequentially down from a basis point increase in the prior quarter our interestbearing cumulative deposit beta was up from in the second quarter due to the presence of higherrate alternatives and ongoing mix shift from noninterestbearing accounts into higheryielding products going forward well continue to maintain our balanced approach being attentive to our client needs and relationships while also striving to maximize value for them outside of rate paid now let me turn over to mike to discuss the financial results in a little more detail mike michael b maguire chief financial officer truist financial corp great thank you bill and good morning everyone im going to begin with net interest income on slide for the quarter taxable equivalent net interest income decreased linkedquarter primarily due to lower average earning assets and higher deposit costs although net interest income was down linkedquarter we are encouraged that the decline was slower than the decrease observed in the second quarter as deposit betas increased at a more moderate pace reported net interest margin increased basis points after declining for two consecutive quarters nim stabilization reflected our ongoing balance sheet optimization initiatives including focusing on our core clients improving spreads on new and renewed loans reducing loweryielding loan portfolios and paying down highercost wholesale borrowings including fhlb advances which were down about billion on average compared to the second quarter turning to noninterest income on slide fee income decreased million or relative to the second quarter the decline was primarily attributable to lower insurance income which decreased million sequentially due to seasonality insurance production is typically lowest in the third quarter and highest in the second insurance fundamentals remain strong driven by new business growth improved retention and favorable pricing all of which contributed to organic revenue growth on a likequarter basis service charges on deposits were down million in the third quarter due primarily to million of client refund accruals that were driven by changes we made to our deposit fee protocols investment banking and trading income was lower by million while other income increased million primarily due to higher income from other investments fee income was flat on a likequarter basis as higher insurance income and higher other income were offset by lower service charges and lower investment banking and trading income next ill cover noninterest expense on slide reported noninterest expense was flat sequentially as lower adjusted expense was offset by a million increase in mergerrelated and restructuring expense driven mostly by severance and facilities rationalization adjusted noninterest expense decreased basis points sequentially in line with our july guidance range of flat to down the decrease in adjusted expenses was driven by lower personnel expense and reduced professional fees and outside processing expense partially offset by higher other expense the increase in other expense included million of costs arising from the previously mentioned client deposit service charge refund accruals as well as the settlement of certain litigation matters including a settlement and patent licensing agreement which resolved the usaa patent infringement lawsuit if you excluded these items adjusted expenses declined by linkedquarter the work associated with our gross cost saves program is well underway as we will discuss on slide in september we announced a million gross cost saves plan truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 that will be achieved over the next to months the cost saves will include million from reductions in force million from organizational realignment and simplification and million from technology expense reductions since these initiatives were announced in midseptember we have already realigned significant elements of our organizational and operational structure to improve efficiency and to drive revenue opportunities the work were doing includes optimizing spans and layers to improve organizational design health consolidating redundant functions restructuring select businesses and geographic simplification all of which will result in reductions in force over the next couple of quarters in addition we are aggressively managing thirdparty spend reducing our corporate real estate footprint and rationalizing technology spend based on the latest information available we still expect onetime costs associated with the cost saves program to range from to of gross cost saves we also continue to project the cost saves program will help us manage adjusted expense growth to to in which is net of natural expense growth driven by inflation and other factors moving to asset quality on slide asset quality metrics continue to normalize in the third quarter but overall remain manageable non performing assets were unchanged linkedquarter while earlystage delinquencies increased basis points sequentially as increases in our consumer portfolios were partially offset by declines in commercial included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio which represents of total loans were pleased that non performing and criticized and classified office loans increased only modestly linkedquarter while we increased the reserve on this portfolio from at june up to at september our net chargeoff ratio decreased basis points to basis points reflecting the prior quarter impact of the student loan sale partially offset by increases in our cre and consumer lending portfolios indiscernible as provision expense exceeded net chargeoffs by million our alll ratio increased to up basis points sequentially and basis points yearoveryear due to ongoing credit normalization and greater economic uncertainty consistent with our commentary last quarter we have tightened our risk appetite in select areas though we maintain our throughthecycle supportive approach for highquality longterm clients turning to capital now on slide based on our assessment of the proposed capital rules we feel confident in our ability to meet the requirements under the proposed phasein periods truist added basis points of cet1 capital in the third quarter through a combination of organic capital generation and disciplined rwa management with a cet1 ratio of truist remains wellcapitalized relative to our new minimum regulatory requirement of which took place on october as a company we are strongly committed to building capital and achieving a cet1 ratio of approximately by the end the year the projected trajectory for our cet1 ratio does incorporate headwinds from the pending fdic assessment which is now expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter our primary capital priorities are supporting the organic growth needs of new and existing core clients and the payment of our per share common dividend we have no plans to repurchase shares over the nearterm and we will continue to allow previous acquisitions to mature rwa management continues to be disciplined as we allocate less capital to certain businesses though we have been very clear that our balance sheet is open to core clients in addition we continue to believe that truists capital flexibility with truist insurance holdings is a distinctive advantage we estimate that our residual ownership stake provides greater than basis points of additional capital flexibility the table in the center of the slide provides an updated analysis of our aoci based on estimated cash flows in todays forward curve we would expect the component of aoci attributable to securities to decline from billion at the end of the third quarter to billion by the end of or a decline of finally as it relates to the proposed rules for a long truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 term debt requirement we estimate that truists binding constraint is at the bank level and that the shortfall is approximately billion we are confident that we will meet the proposed requirements at both the bank and holding company level through normal debt issuance during the phasein period now i will review our updated guidance on slide looking into the fourth quarter of we expect revenues to be flat or to decline from gaap revenue of billion we expect linkedquarter improvement in noninterest income due to higher insurance service charges on deposit income and investment banking and trading income partially offset by lower mortgage and other income net interest income is likely to remain under some pressure due to our smaller balance sheet and modest nim compression adjusted expenses of billion are expected to decline due to lower personnel and other expenses in april we stated that our expense guidance excluded expenses associated with tih independence readiness previously weve not called out these costs because they totaled only million through the first nine months of including million in the second quarter and million in the third quarter in the fourth quarter we expect these expenses to approximate million which are excluded from our expense guidance for the full year we expect revenues to increase by approximately which is at the midpoint of our previous revenue guidance of up to our guidance includes the million client refund accrual that negatively impacted fees in the third quarter full year adjusted expenses are still on track to increase this includes million related to the legal settlements and client deposit service charge refunds but excludes the million of tih independence readiness costs for in terms of asset quality we have tightened our guidance from a range of basis points to basis points to approximately basis points for the full year which includes the impact of the student loan sale finally we expect our tax rate tax rate effective to approximate or on a taxable equivalent basis compared to and previously now ill hand it back to bill for some final remarks william henry rogers chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp great thanks mike and ill conclude on slide so looking beyond the third quarter our transformation into a simpler more profitable company is underway were driving swift and meaningful actions to simplify our organization which include key organizational changes so for example in the recent weeks weve streamlined our commercial community banking regions from to realigned several overlapping units into a unified commercial real estate business we merged our consumer payments and wholesale payments businesses into a single enterprise payments organization which will help us to accelerate payments activity more effectively across truist there have been a number of team consolidations within our consumer and small business banking lines businesses weve also realigned nine teams under our enterprise operational services to drive efficiencies across our support team serving the whole organization all of these changes are part of our million cost saves program which is well underway and designed to drive better service for our clients and limit adjusted expense growth to flat to up in although were focused on reducing the rate of expense growth we will continue to invest in our risk management organization and ability to maintain strong asset quality metrics while there are many changes happening inside truist weve not lost focus on our core consumer and commercial businesses which is an area that will continue to see significant investment net new checking account production has been positive for the first three quarters of this truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 year and were on track to continue positive net news for the whole year during the quarter we acquired more than households through our digital channel were also maintaining momentum in wealth where net organic asset flows have been positive in of the past quarters client satisfaction scores were stable or increased across most rsbb channels during the third quarter and in corporate and commercial new left lead transactions were up yearoveryear lastly our wholesale payments pipeline is up yearoveryear were also seeing strong improvement in client sentiment amongst commercial clients reflecting product and digital investments that weve already made as a company were also operating our balance sheet more efficiently thanks to our focus on core clients deemphasizing lowerreturn portfolios and paying down higher cost debt were building capital and we feel confident in our ability to satisfy the requirements proposed in the basel iii end game rules with the proposed phasein periods while preserving our strategic flexibility with tih in conclusion were making progress and were doing whats necessary to improve our financial performance to meet your high expectations and of course ours i am truly optimistic about truist and i know were well positioned for the future our teammates are really performing at a high level and they are committed to serving our clients caring for each other and capitalizing on our great growth markets i am really proud of our teammates before we move to qa i also want to publicly thank the eight members of our board of directors who plan to retire at the end of this year im deeply grateful for their years of service and meaningful contributions to our company truist literally exists due to their leadership and confidence following these retirements our board will consist of members including independent directors who are well positioned to oversee and advance our strategic plans during this period of rapid industry transformation so with that brad let me turn it back over to you and we look forward to the qa brad milsaps headinvestor relations truist financial corp thank you bill anthony at this time will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session as you do that id like to ask participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one followup in order that we may accommodate as many of you as possible in the call today truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from ken usdin with jefferies you may now go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning guys thanks for the color and the update i just bill just coming back to the independence preparation for tih and articles that were in the paper i know youre still and mike talking about the optionality can you just give us an updated sense of just how youre looking at the value of the business financially versus strategically and what would change here to make you guys move forward with some type of transaction to move it forward william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah ken good morning and thanks for that as you can imagine i dont want to comment on any sort of rumor or speculation but to your question think about the reason we did the opportunity with stone point i mean what we wanted to do is exactly what you highlighted in your question is to create this financial and strategic flexibility for both truist and for tih we wanted to establish value in the business and the business is growing i mean weve been able to hire and retain talent so we feel really good about whats happening in the core insurance business we wanted to make sure that the insurance business had flexibility to continue to grow and then that truist had an opportunity to respond to whatever may happen i mean were obviously in a market thats got lot of uncertainty to it and we just want to retain that strategic and financial flexibility so theres not one thing theres not like a queue if something happens we do this but we want to just continue to reserve this flexibility and continue to apply it to both the bank and the insurance business ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah and i guess just a followup on it as well like at what point does financial benefit become strategic because a lot of the questions we get are the tradeoff between the two an obvious ability to improve capital versus a delta in terms of like fee contribution roe et cetera so its hard for the investor community to kind of just understand what that incremental switch is i guess maybe how do you think about that notion of like when financial becomes strategic william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah as i said there isnt a particular trigger point we just want to make sure that we retain that flexibility and were constantly looking at everything that you just talked about and factoring that into the decisionmaking this is something that we sort of continually keep in front of ourselves we keep in front of the board but i think the intentionality i mean reason we did this is were allowed to have this conversation around flexibility ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right okay thank you bill truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp okay thanks ken operator our next question will come from john mcdonald with autonomous research you may now go ahead john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research good morning guys i wanted to ask you about net interest income a number of banks have said that they see nii dollars potentially bottoming in the fourth quarter mike mentioned you see a little bit of slippage into the fourth quarter but do you have any visibility on whether that could stabilize fourth quarter and what factors should we think about for you as we think about the nii path heading into next year michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah good morning john we obviously did see some pressure this quarter actually probably a little bit better than we expected and that we talked about during the second quarter we do expect to continue to see some pressure in the fourth and frankly even into the first half of and i think that just has to do with the rate path we have an expectation that we think weve seen our last hike and we dont have a cut in the forecast until july of next year we have two cuts in the second half and so as betas sort of again the good news is are slowing down and we feel like grinding a bit lower we should still feel a little bit of pressure there were trying to combat some of that pressure weve been very intentional around how were managing rate paid across our client base were beginning to see some nice progress as it relates to new and renewed credit spreads were repricing some of the fixed rate loans so the good news is is while theres pressure its moderating but we still do see that pressure into early next year john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got you thanks mike and in terms of the expenses when you talk about the goal for next year to be flat to up can you remind us how much of the million gross are you expecting it next year and whether you might also have tih readiness costs go into next year too michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah i can start there john i think bill may want to weigh in too hard to say i mean we said on the million its kind of to months i mean i think if you think about twothirds plus or minus being recognized next year maybe its a little more than that thats how were thinking about the math there and that would again john give us the confidence that we have to make sure we manage expense growth to less than you asked about tih readiness cost as well were not ready to talk about yet there we will give you more visibility to that when we guide for the full year in january john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay fair enough thanks truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 operator our next question will come from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america you may now go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you good morning michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess maybe mike just following up on the expense savings one just trying to think through when we look at the to growth next year when do these get realized and should we assume that the expense run rate through continues to decline so when were thinking about exit second half expenses will be lower than first half is that just from a construct standpoint the right way to think about how these flow through relative to your offsetting investments michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah ebrahim i think the way id answer that question is a lot of the action were taking actually right now and in the rest of the fourth quarter and early next year around for example some of the organizational design and health and some of the reductions in force youll see that come into the run rate relatively quickly same goes for some of the realignment of businesses those have different flavors in certain cases if we significantly restructure a business like as a good example we discontinued our middle market agency trading business earlier this year that was a pretty quick adjustment to run rate other adjustments were making maybe take place throughout the course of next year and then technology spend which as you recall is a pretty significant component of our cost savings plan that has a variety of flavors as well so id say for the most part youre going to see pretty good progress on run rate adjustment sort of as we exit and enter and youll see i think just sort of continuous improvement throughout the course of the year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thanks mike and i guess just a separate question so you talked about exiting certain businesses a student loan portfolio another one how much more is there as you think about just making the balance sheet more efficient optimizing capital is there a lot more to go on the asset side that you could look to exit or sale and if theres any way to quantify that michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp i think we got after the lowest hanging fruit pretty quickly ebrahim the student portfolio was not a strategic asset for us it was less profitable there have been other businesses within even our ci business for example that we didnt feel like were highly as strategic weve talked a lot about correspondent mortgage and some of our national indirect lending businesses so i think that we have a pretty good line of sight to it i think going forward truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 its just much more around optimization right and being more disciplined in how we select opportunities how we price opportunities were seeing that come through in our results as well but theres not i dont think a significant shoe to drop on portfolio sales and those types of things william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp maybe the only thing to add to that mike is just particularly in the areas that weve seen really good growth like sheffield and service finance well do more securitization so well create more velocity around those on our balance sheet which i think are great so continue the production continue to acquire new clients but increase the velocity and well look at that with other parts of our portfolio so i think mike said it right i mean theres not a major power shift but this optimization strategy our team has really embraced and i think we just continue to have more opportunities im going to say around the edges but maybe more significant than that as we move forward and you saw that reflected in the nim this quarter ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thank you both william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah operator our next question will come from erika najarian with ubs you may now go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc this first question is for you bill i think just taking a step back and thinking about slide i think a handful of your investors did think that once you struck the deal with stone point that it was a sort of oneway exit that being said that deal was struck in february right the world didnt change until march and so my question for you is that you have this monetization opportunity for truist insurance holdings and as you think about the proceeds again clearly the world has changed so how do you balance essentially the push that some investors are calling for in terms of restructuring your portfolio very meaningfully and i can see in that middle chart in slide that that portfolio is a very very slow bleed versus if you do that youre essentially making the same call you did in which is assume that rates are going to stay where they are versus maybe doing more on the rwa mitigation side which will cost you more in nii over the nearterm but wont trap you into making a rate bet william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 erika i think youve been in all our meetings these are all the things that were evaluating everything is in a bucket to discuss and as you noted i mean the world changed pretty substantially from march but it just reaffirmed our desire to have this flexibility and going back a little bit to the independents question remember we sort of got this large capital benefit but we always had this part of getting that capital benefit was the expense of creating the independents over the longterm as you just highlighted that so to us that was always a really good tradeoff in terms of creating that flexibility so i dont want to speculate today as to were going to go left or were going to go right other than to say i think youve encapsulated almost perfectly in your question all the alternatives we would consider and there are tradeoffs to every single one theres not one perfect path there are tradeoffs to all of them and were going to make the decisions that are in the best longterm interest of our shareholders thats going to be our north star and the guiding post as we think through this and factor in all the environment that we exist today and thatll exist tomorrow with everything that you put into your question erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you and my second question is far more boring on the service charges mike it went down to million from like a million handle and million in the previous quarter in the previous march quarter was that a onetime reversal or is this a new run rate i know that there was some offset in other income but just trying to think about the moving pieces for fees from here michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah during the quarter the accrual that we referenced was million and thats not something that we would expect to continue erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah operator our next question will come from john pancari with evercore isi you may now go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 on the commentary you gave to john mcdonalds question regarding some incremental pressure and margin in nii in fourth quarter and into the first half can you maybe help quantify that magnitude of the pressure that you would expect based upon your rate outlook and the balance sheet dynamics and then secondly could you possibly unpack the deposit growth assumption and deposit beta assumption thats baked into that thanks michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp john ill just maybe give you a sense for the outlook on nim for the fourth quarter i think were again as i mentioned with the deposit betas creeping were at as you know as of the third quarter we were at in the second we would expect that to continue to worsen a bit just as customers continue to reprice a bit thats obviously slowing and for the most part across three or four of our segments is sort of all the way where we think terminal betas might be but were still seeing some movement on the consumer side of things so i think a little bit of pressure from the betas again offset perhaps a bit by some of the credit spread widening that were seeing so from a nim perspective maybe its a few basis points as far as our revenue outlook for the quarter we have a sense that its probably worse perhaps flat nii is going to be down a touch and fees will be up a touch so id just sort of maybe leave it at that as far as the balance sheet sizing we had a much more significant decline in earning assets during the third quarter around billion we would expect that to be much much smaller in the fourth quarter so maybe closer to the tune of billion or so youve got the securities portfolio thats cash flowing at about billion and maybe just a little bit of pressure on loans so i think thats probably the math you need john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thank you thats helpful and then secondly you had a pretty solid remix of the funding base that you discussed a bit on slide in third quarter given the some of the pay down or reduction in the fhlb advances et cetera how much more do you think of rationalization of the funding mix do you think there is in coming quarters as you look at the setup now thanks michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah i think the third quarter was unique in the amount of remixing that was accomplished i mean you saw the student loan portfolio was a big component of that and thats a pretty low net interest margin contributor same thing the investment portfolio at billion we took cash down by close to billion so if you think about that stuff as sort of right at sofr really really thin spreads and then at the same time taking off the fhlb advances that was the that was really the driver that mixing that saw some of the benefit on the nim and that sort of aided the nii in the quarter i think in the fourth quarter youre going to see a more sort of traditional march of again ive hit it deposit costs creeping up a little bit higher hopefully again well continue to be successful as we have been around thinking about rate paid i mean im really pleased by how the business has been performing i mean weve been testing different rate strategies weve been looking at promo rates weve looked at exceptionbased pricing and structure and so that will continue and so were going to try to do the best we can to manage that but i think the mix driver that we saw in  is really a q3only opportunity john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks mike truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 operator our next question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo securities you may now go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i hear you about the expense guide for next year is to so that would be better and i hear you about taking the tough actions but then i look at the core efficiency ratio of around and its not what investors signed up for when you announced the merger even recognizing the rate headwinds and other things i dont think its where you wanted to be so as you embark on what maybe you could call truist as compared to truist how is management changing in terms of the time to make decisions truist was like selecting best of breed it seemed to take a long time maybe that was slowed down by such a large board which now is getting reduced how is truist better on intensity how is truist better in terms of moving shareholders up the pecking order and i guess generally with all your optimism bill that certainly is not reflected in the share price and theres a lot of frustrated and disgruntled shareholders out there so how can truist with the million of savings maybe strategic actions with insurance intensity and the way you manage help shareholders more william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah mike thanks the intensity is i dont know how to what superlative to use other than high so the intensity is really good and whats happened with the cost save program and we talk about the million in cost saves but i dont want to diminish the simplification of our business so creating these consumer and wholesale towers and creating the simplification of our business that really has allowed us to move a lot faster so ive been really pleased with how the team has embraced this whole process i mean leaders are stepping up in really demonstrable ways getting in front of it and theyre making decisions at a much much faster pace so i outlined a bunch of the different consolidations and those type of things those would have been more sequential in the past you sort of do one you do another one you sort of go through the process and today theyre all on these great parallel paths and i think thats going to have a faster longerterm impact and look i mean to your point i mean were not happy with where the efficiency is now i wanted to state that as publicly as possible and we have demonstrable plans we talked about the overall play on the cost saves but longterm that also has to result in better revenue growth and all the things that we do together of bringing these businesses together optimizing the balance sheet creating capacity creating product and capability training our teammates having them lean in demonstrated net new all the things that are building in terms of the momentum those are key and i can assure you for our board we have presented an improvement plan on the efficiency ratio longterm improvement plan and well be on that track i mean we share your frustration trust me but i think weve got now the structure in place the leadership in place the commitment the intensity the support and were moving fast and our team can feel it and theyve embraced it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just as a followup since you did present a plan to the board for the efficiency ratio i dont think consensus expects much improvement next year i guess next year is going to be tough to have positive operating leverage but if you could comment on that and maybe just a little bit more meat on the bones you gave a lot onethird less bank region one payment business any other color you can give on the efficiency and when you say simplification i mean you guys arent citigroup right its not like youre in countries youre in adjacent truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 regional markets where you should be able to be a lot more simple than what happened after the merger so positive optimal leverage improvement in efficiency next year is this really as you say a longterm plan william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah as you know on the there just as with efficiency there is a positive operating leverage longterm plan in all of our businesses and part of the simplification allows them to control that destiny and make decisions about that on a faster basis it will be harder in the first part of next year i mean as you know i mean youre sort of running off an nii comparison so thats just a tougher hurdle but as we get into the latter part of next year i mean were going to see continuous improvement and commitment to that on a longterm basis so i cant without sort of a rate forecast and all that particularly i cant comment exactly but i can comment that during the second half of next year youre going to start seeing a lot of improvement on the operating leverage and going into well be firmly committed and be on a really good flight path and then as you and then to the simplification things well continue to its a really good question well continue to outline some of those i mean just think about for example care centers i mean we have a lot of care centers serving a lot of different businesses in the merger we needed to bring those all over the transom and have them perform well weve invested in a lot of technology and we can consolidate care centers just think about that as one of dozens and dozens of examples of this component of simplification so while i agree with you were not sort of globally in countries or whatever that parallel may have been but we still have a lot of opportunity to make this company simpler faster leaner and more responsive to clients and as you noted more responsive to shareholders mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator our next question will come from matt oconnor with deutsche bank you may now go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning can you guys elaborate on the service charge issue was that something that was kind of self identified was it driven by the cfpb or we havent seen that at peers at least not yet can you elaborate what happened there please william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah matt this is bill yeah we did that on our own volition i mean weve looked at all of our products and offerings weve listened to a lot of client feedback we reviewed and changed our protocols with respect to depositrelated fees and that resulted in refunds that did impact revenue and other expense i think were taking just a more contemporary view of sort of where the world is where the puck is going and making sure that we get ahead of that were staying in front and creating this clearer path as possible for next year and the continuous improvement we want to make in our business matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 and then how do we think about the run rate of the service charges given these changes obviously were not going to run rate to million but i guess i would assume its lower than previous quarters if you implemented changes going forward michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah look i mean i think theres been pressure on this item in general just given the evolution of the service charges on deposits but i think you can safely assume that the million that weve noted here during the third quarter was a third quarter event so again i think you should expect there to be the same style of pressure youve seen on this line item sort of trending in the industry and for truist but this particular event wasnt sort of a step functional driver matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just to summarize i guess at this point with the changes that you made in the refunds like how would you frame your approach to service charges are you kind of in the middle in terms of being conservative or more on the conservative side how would you frame the overdraft and the fees overall the approach william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i think weve got a great product in truist one and that really reflects where were going and so were adding almost all of our new clients to truist one i highlighted some of the benefits some of the things were doing to that and then were migrating some of our back book to truist one so i dont know how to characterize conservative work but i do know this is purposeful and i think weve got an incredibly competitive product that has all the right mixes and that its really really clientresponsive but its also contributing to our growth so while service charges overall as mike talked will continue to click down were balancing that with growth adding new clients expanding relationships and i think thats sort of the right mix as we think going forward those things wont align perfectly quartertoquarter but longterm i think were on a really really good longterm shareholder valuebuilding path matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks matt operator our next question will come from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets you may now go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning bill good morning mike william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc bill can you share with us when you think about the game plan that you and your peers have had to use post financial crisis and this low interest rate environment of basis points to basis points there was a blip in of course but now were in this new rate environment that was really prefinancial crisis what changes are you if you are having some changes what changes are you implementing to win new business in this new rate environment since its quite a bit different than it was three or four years ago with both commercial and consumer customers loans deposits et cetera william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah gerard im unfortunately maybe of the age to have operated in this environment in the past so gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc same here william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah exactly so i have some familiarity this is not unprecedented or new territory and i think sort of a couple things it first starts with and you highlighted it i mean the cost of funding is not free so the first part start with all the things weve been talking about about optimization and demanding more full relationships from our clients and all the things that go along with that but you have to offer competitive products and capabilities and be leading and so for us i highlighted a lot of the metrics things like netnew on the consumer side so weve got a product like truist one thats really responsive were winning the battle with the competitive environment that clients want more than rate paid youve got rate paid is not the only option you got to offer more product and more capabilities so i think were winning on that front and then on the commercial and corporate side same thing were in the advice business and if we start that were in the advice business versus were in the rate business we start with a really good framework so this whole concept of business lifecycle advisory where we are i highlighted the fact that were winning on left lead relationships so were becoming more important to our clients were becoming the goto with our clients were in the first call perspective where you want to be so i think the changes are just relevant so much more important start with the market share that we enjoy in our core markets all the ubiquity and efficiency that comes with that so this is not new work but its a doubledown on you have to be really good at the job you have to be really good at advice you have to really be good at product and capability and the which by the way i think thats going to really work well for truist the new definition of winning i think fits perfectly into our strategy going forward gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i appreciate those insights bill and then on credit maybe this is bestanswered by clarke you guys talked about tightening up i think the credit standards a bit but im more interested were not worried about you folks you guys have a good track record of credit underwriting but can you make any comments about what others might truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 have been doing over the last two or three years whether its nondepositories or depositories in lending and those maybe aggressive actions if there were any how that could impact your customers who again youve underwritten fine but maybe theyve done something crazy with somebody else which then the second derivative you guys get impacted but clarke any color on that especially compared to prior cycles clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah gerard its a great question i know weve my peers and i have talked about this but id say in general particularly since the great recession i think the discipline in the industry overall has been really good and i think the fundamental credit approach despite the low rate environment i think the industry in general is in a much better place than we were prefinancial crisis and even the nonbank players generally have done a good job there so i dont think theres we dont necessarily see a big shoe to drop i think the biggest impact were trying to evaluate through as you shift from a long secular low rate environment to where we are now is how economic some of those deals were even if you thought youre underwriting well and how sustainable will all that be we feel really good about where we are and id say generally the industry as well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator we will now take our final question from ryan kenny with morgan stanley you may now go ahead ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning so just want to clarify something on the earlier questions on the nii path so we heard the comment around not expecting any significant loan portfolio sales from here but can you give us an update on your current approach to managing the securities portfolio and specifically what are your views on potentially repositioning parts of the securities portfolio especially if more capital is freed up from potential future exits or optionality michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah good morning ryan on the securities side weve on average we see billion to billion of just cash flow and maturities from the portfolio i think you should expect that to continue in terms of sort of just some of the drag on the earning asset base as far as the repositioning i dont think theres any new news here i mean obviously long rates of sort of been on the rise here and so weve been tracking the unrealized losses and we have some incremental disclosure kind of on our current position and the burn down on our capital slide i think were constantly evaluating potential strategies and the likes as it relates to the bond portfolio but nothing new we did id just say as we think about this new world were living in where these unrealized losses at least the securities oci is a factor in terms of capital in an effort to manage that potential volatility in the future we did add some payfixed hedges during the third quarter which well see some benefit from to the extent that kind of rates hang where they are or worsen a bit so weve got about a third a little less than a third of the afs securities hedged truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks and then just as a followup on the credit side just give a little bit more color on what youre seeing in terms of credit quality and im asking because it does look like youve increased your nco guide slightly to the higher end of the prior range just wondering if you can share what youre seeing under the surface clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah ryan its a good question first id say we havent established our guidance yet but i believe the things that will drive where we go forward are the same considerations we are seeing now coming out of  and going into  and so i would say for us we are seeing normalization in our consumer area particularly in the lowend consumer so think of our regional acceptance subprime auto and then youve also got some defined seasonality in the second half of the year thats impacting  outlook the other piece would be ph what bill spoke of earlier and mike were remixing our balance sheet to be more optimal and so youre seeing more growth in our highermargin businesses like sheffield and service finance but they carry higher normal losses and then i think most importantly something that we control is our efforts to get ahead of the cre office risk so in  we were very intentional about working through moving from just identifying the risk there to actually resolving several of the problem credits and we took some losses there to do that and were anticipating maybe opportunities to do more in  so i think those are the three factors that will impact where losses go ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator this concludes our question brad milsaps a headinvestor relations truist financial corp okay operator sorry this concludes our question andanswer
