which drove strong fee income and help overcome continued softness in net interest income credit quality was outstanding resulting in another provision benefit loan growth was modest excluding ppp generally in line with our expectations we also achieved a major integration milestone this past weekend and well share more details on these topics during the presentation of so if i move you to slide id like to begin with our purpose which is to inspire and build better lives and communities we believe our purposedriven culture is the primary factor behind our success as a company our purpose defines how we do business every day and it serves as a framework for how we make decisions a recent example of this was our decision to remain open during our conversion last saturday so we could care for our clients and address any questions to my knowledge thats a first for a major systems conversion such as ours ive said in our culture purpose performance teamwork and a clientfirst mindset all coexist and theres no better evidence of that than the extraordinary success our teammates delivered this past weekend in our most significant merger milestone todate details of which ill cover shortly slide describes how were living out our purpose and highlights some of the notable progress weve made during the quarter during the pandemic philanthropic giving was a natural way to put our purpose into action due to the effects of the coronavirus on our clients teammates and communities the purpose is much broader than philanthropy we developed this slide around major themes contained in our csr and esg report because theyre the topics that are most important to all of our stakeholders including our shareholders i wont cover every point on the slide let me just highlight a few we continue to make strong progress against our billion community benefits plan currently at of target including the ongoing impact that truist community capital provides our communities with regards to affordable housing access to healthy food and education and investments in job creation and small business truist and everfi announced that all elementary school students nationwide will soon have access to wordforce universe a digital early literacy program ill talk more about this shortly but weve migrated million clients to the new truist digital banking experience which includes enhanced digital investment and moneymanagement capabilities personalized insights and a holistic personal financial management tool we committed to increase diversity in our senior leadership roles to at least by were currently at almost and clearly on track importantly longterm the way we create a more diverse senior leadership organization is by recruiting diverse early talent and then developing retaining and promoting over time and for early career program hiring in of the seats at truist were filled by diverse candidates all of this progress combined with enhanced truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 disclosures has resulted in solid improvements in our esg scores lastly in a few weeks well release our inaugural truist tcfd report our teammates and i are very proud of truist in all the ways we deliver on our purpose so turning to the third quarter performance highlights on slide we earned billion or earnings per share for the quarter on a reported basis on an adjusted basis we are at billion or per share adjusted eps increased versus the same quarter last year and is largely driven by the provision benefit sequentially eps declined as we had a greater benefit from the provision last quarter and seasonally stronger revenues last quarter we had strong returns including the adjusted rotce excluding the reserve release adjusted rotce was still very good north of revenues totaled billion fairly stable compared to last quarter on an adjusted basis yearoveryear revenue growth was as much stronger fee income offsets an almost 30basis point decline in margin and an decline in loans a reflection of this unique environment that were all in the stronger adjusted fee income which grew compared to a year ago did drive slightly higher expenses than expected but our ppnr is broadly in line with our expectations asset quality continues to be an excellent story as we outperformed our net chargeoff guidance with lower chargeoffs across ci combined with strong recoveries during the quarter we were pleased to increase the dividends and we completed the constellation acquisition which had a very good first quarter with truist insurance also we announced the strategic acquisition of service finance which will close later this year daryl will share some additional information on service finance but its broadly a reflection of truist skating to where the puck is going and partnering with a leader in home improvement pointofsale lending we also completed our retail mortgage origination conversions and benefits which daryl will also highlight later last but certainly not least im very excited to report this past weekend we completed a major phase of our core bank conversion after a lot of intense deliberate thoughtful and purposeful preparation by our team we were able to stand up the truist technology ecosystem and migrate all heritage bbt retail wealth and business clients to it the event went extremely well and there are a number of notable positive impacts for clients and teammates starting this past tuesday over heritage bbt teammates were able to log on to the new truist commercial lending ecosystem for the first time because of the conversion the sales force client management and sales pipeline system is now directly connected to the ncino lending origination system which allows for better communication and workflow across the deal team and visibility on progress of the loan all in one place these upgrades also lay the foundation for future digital innovation were now able to offer truist products to new clients and the heritage bbt clients through our branches and digitally through truistcom including our new truist ready now loan a small dollar lending solution for existing clients to cover emergency financing needs between and consistent with our belief on the importance of emergency savings we upgraded our atm contact center and digital payment capabilities across a number of dimensions including more client selfservice improved authentication and operational simplification while this was not a physical branding event the conversion places us on excellent footing for the final conversion in the first quarter of when heritage suntrust clients will transition to the truist ecosystem and all branches will become truist truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 again i want to congratulate our teammates on a job well done they prepared with intensity and purpose for multiple quarters they learned and applied lessons from previous conversion work they worked nonstop this past weekend and delivered a seamless conversion i really could not be more proud now lets go into slide we have three significant items that negatively affected earnings during the quarter first merger charges totaled million after tax lower than last quarter because higher voluntary separation retirement program costs were reflected in the second quarter this vsrp program is one of the many components of our overall costsaving goal approximately half of our teammates who elected to participate left on september and i cannot thank them enough for their longstanding efforts to build the foundation of truist by helping create two amazing companies in bbt and suntrust and then helping bring truist to life during our almost first two years of existence incremental operating expenses related to the merger were million after tax as a reminder these are mergerrelated expenses but dont meet the technical definition of a mergerrelated and restructuring charges and will not be part of our run rate in and beyond also we had a onetime professional fee accrual that met our disclosure and adjustment threshold totaling million after tax this fee was incurred to develop an ongoing program to identify prioritize and road map teammategenerated revenue growth and expensesaving opportunities as part of the merger and beyond this helps ensure that well achieve our costsaving targets its also fuel for creating more capacity for investments in the future will also improve the client experience simplify our processes and create a more engaged and energized workforce our teammates generated more than initial ideas which we consolidated and narrowed down to approximately and were building the execution plan ultimately our goal is for this to be an ongoing way of how we do business at truist empowering our teammates to identify and execute on ideas to improve our company the total impact on these three items was per share sic per share turning to slide as weve noted truist is the first large merger in the digital age so were highly focused on ensuring a smooth transition for our digitally active clients our new truist digital experience reflects two of our core digital and technology principles cocreation with our clients and failing fast to learn fast we built this new platform based directly on clients feedback and were introducing it in waves learning from each release and getting better every time we made great progress in the third quarter inviting approximately million retail wealth and small business clients to migrate to the truist digital experience through september about half of those clients have started and used the platform in lieu of their heritage app by the end of this quarter our goal is to migrate all digital clients to the truist digital platforms weve received ongoing feedback from our clients and incorporated opportunities for improvement iteratively over the course of the migration which has resulted in improved client experience over time this derisked our core bank conversion and makes truist the first to delink the frontend conversion from the backend a patented approach we can leverage for future backend innovation as you can see on slide we continue to experience healthy demand for digital banking services as our clients look for more convenient and effective ways to transact and manage their finances the pace of digital adoption has been especially rapid in mobile active mobile users and zelle transactions are up and respectively yearoveryear truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 last quarter i highlighted that we are creating a common core digital architecture and platform for retail wealth and small business clients which creates agility and seamless client experiences yet ones that are tailored and designed for the unique needs of each client segment for our wealth clients we provide a differentiated digital client experience that reflects their relationship with truist an integrated platform will provide a onestop shop for their holistic financial picture including a unified investment portfolio experience that is agnostic to whether the account is a trust or brokerage account holistic financial planning with external account aggregation and the ability to secure store and exchange documents with their advisor and the same access to lowcost digital and automated investing that we now offer retail clients turning to slide on an absolute basis loans declined billion sequentially however if you exclude the impact of ppp forgiveness average loans increased billion or annualized consistent with our outlook when you peel back the onion there are some good trends but we also have headwinds ppp declined billion on average in the quarter and dealer floor plan declined an additional billion we expect ppp to decline an additional billion or so on average in the fourth quarter dealer utilization is about well below historical averages weve been somewhat cautious in cre although were beginning to see opportunities in that space that meet our risk appetite and portfolio diversity objectives even so that portfolio declined billion sequentially excluding these items commercial loans increased billion or sequentially so were seeing some improved momentum more banking regions are experiencing core ci growth pipelines in the commercial community bank and cre businesses continue to grow and our revolver exposure also grew sequentially evidence of our relevance that our clients are building capacity for investments and expansion big picture our corporate and commercial clients remain optimistic but labor shortages and supply chain issues are affecting their businesses no different than truist netnet we believe there is meaningful upside to the ci growth story as the economy continues to improve pandemicrelated disruptions subside and the liquidityrelated distortions from ongoing government stimulus abate but the timing of all this is difficult to predict on the consumer slide mortgage has shifted from a shrinking to a growing portfolio reflecting increased operational capacity slower prepaid speeds and our tactical decision to balance sheet correspondent production were also seeing good performance with indirect auto lightstream sheffield and credit card all of which are growing versus last quarter so turning to slide we added this slide this quarter to provide a little more color on growth and headwinds for average loans into several significant moving pieces longterm loan growth is an output and a highly correlated economic growth which we believe is on firm footing particularly in our markets we also continue to pursue tactics and strategies to capture more than our fair share of loan growth within our risk appetite and diversification objectives including deepening our lending relationships with our wealth clients increasing our digital and point ofsale lending capabilities and expanding our wallet share within certain corporate and commercial clients turning to slide average deposits increased billion or compared to the second quarter largely due to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus more importantly truist continues to resonate with clients we continue to make solid progress with quality account growth yeartodate our net new personal dda accounts grew almost significantly higher than last year net new business dda is up yearover year in addition client attrition from closed branches continues to be very low this performance reflects excellent execution by our retail community bank teammates and with that let me turn it over to daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 daryl n bible chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you bill and good morning everyone turning to slide net interest income was down slightly versus prior quarter this was consistent with our guidance and reflected two competing factors purchase accounting accretion decreased million linked quarter and contributed basis points to reported margin down from basis points in the second quarter however core net interest income increased million this was driven by a larger investment portfolio which resulted in strong deposit growth that more than offset lower ppp revenue core net interest margin decreased basis points due to higher liquidity and lower ppp revenue we expect to earn an additional million in ppp revenues over the coming three quarters and for the balance to be de minimis by mid2022 we continue to be assetsensitive we estimate that a 100basispoint ramp increase would increase nii by a 100basispoints shock would increase nii by we are also wellpositioned to benefit from rising rates at both the short and long end of the curve twothirds of our reported asset sensitivity is from the short end and it assumes deposit beta of approximately in reality we have experienced over the last few years ago deposit betas are likely to be significantly lower than our modeled assumptions on the first few rate hikes for every decline in deposit beta our asset sensitivity increases by about basis points moving to slide as bill highlighted we had a very strong quarter from a fee income perspective fee income excluding security gains from last year was up a very strong like quarter exceeding our initial expectations insurance income increased in total this was due to acquisitions and also a very strong organic growth investment banking had a second best quarter and record ma performance ma results like this do not come in a vacuum they are results of years of investment and commitment to our clients capital markets indiscernible revenue was up yeartodate wealth remains very strong up compared to a year ago as a result of market conditions but also positive asset flows crerelated income was down after its record second quarter performance but momentum continues to be positive residential mortgage was down like quarter due to lower refinance activity however it increased million sequentially primarily due to better servicing income due to lower prepayment speeds and the addition of a new servicing portfolio production income also improved sequentially as we restored capacity after temporarily reducing it last quarter other income of million was also another high watermark largely due to valuation gains related to our sbic funds our nonqualified plan continues to have positive valuation adjustments and we have now included the details of both the nonqualified plan and cva in our earnings release tables turning to expenses on slide adjusted noninterest expense increased sequentially compared to our guidance of a relatively flat drivers included higherthananticipated fee income which pushed incentives above our forecast in addition to a million cost from a nonqualified plan excluding the effects of these items adjusted expenses were only slightly above our expectations on an absolute basis adjusted noninterest expense increased primarily due to higher planned marketing costs as we continue to build our brand awareness as well as higher technology costs which are reflected in software and equipment expense moving to asset quality on slide asset quality remains excellent reflecting our prudent risk culture diversified portfolio favorable economic conditions and the effects of stimulus our net chargeoff ratio was basis points a proforma postfinancialcrisis low leading indications indicators remain strong as npls and earlystage delinquencies remain low our alll coverage ratio decreased to as the economic scenarios continue to truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 improve and but still remains above our cecl day level of we also had a provision benefit of million continuing on slide capital remains strong our cet1 ratio of was above our nearterm target we did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter due to the effects of the recent acquisition activity we have approximately billion to billion of potential capital deployment remaining through the third quarter of we expect to consume approximately million of this capacity via share repurchases in the fourth quarter reflecting our own capital position reduced integration risk on the heels of very successful integration event bill discussed earlier turning to slide we provide additional details about service finance we continue to be very excited about service finance and the acquisition is on track to close later this year service finance is strategically attractive because it expands the scale and capabilities of our existing pointofsale businesses which is where the consumer preferences are shifting in addition we believe home improvement is in a secular growth phase and the professional financing market is highly fragmented service finance is the perfect partner for truist given its proven track record of business development and growth its exclusive focus on home improvement strong digital client experience and an excellent reputation in the marketplace from a financial perspective we have provided a few additional details to help you model the transaction the vast majority of service finance revenue will come in noninterest income the nii is a mix of consumer interest income and discounts provided by the merchants loan yields are in the highsingle digits from a runrate perspective though initially they are somewhat lower due to the impact of promotional periods on an unseasoned loan portfolio we expect production to grow at a fast pace over the coming years we expect to allocate billion to goodwill and million to intangibles we also expect to capture approximately million in value over time from a stepup in tax basis on a standalone basis the acquisition is gaapdilutive in year one half of this dilution is driven by the utilization of capital in lieu of share repurchases the other half is driven by the firstyear gaap net income contribution earnings streams take time to build as we transition from an originatetosell to an originatetohold model but over the long term it is extremely profitable and accretive to all of our kpis we did not model any future revenue synergies but see many opportunities for better leverage our combined capabilities and accelerate our revenue and growth potential we have terminated thirdparty partnerships with certain pointofsale financing providers the impact of this is billion of runoff will begin in early moving to the integration update on slide as bill highlighted we achieved a major milestone this past weekend with the successful migration of our heritage bbt retail and commercial clients to the truist ecosystem another milestone in the quarter was completing the migration of our truist retail mortgage origination platform turning to slide we are committed to achieving billion of net cost saves and continue to make progress in each of the five categories thirdparty spend is down from the baseline levels exceeding our targeted reduction of we closed branches during the third quarter bringing the cumulative closures to were still on track to achieve approximately total closures by the first quarter of we are also seveneighths of the way towards our nonbranch facility reduction target which will likely have more reductions to come in average ftes are down since the merger excluding the acquisitions we expect further declines in ftes in the coming quarters due to the vsrp program where the firstquarter wave of departures began on september technology saves will materialize after redundant systems are decommissioned in we have also noted areas where we continue to make critical investments including digital technology talent and acquisitions in select business lines truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 turning to slide we still expect to incur a total merger cost of approximately billion through we have incurred cumulative merger costs of approximately billion through the third quarter reflecting the considerable integration work on slide we continue to expect these costs to decrease after the first quarter of final bank conversion and then drop off entirely after continuing on slide core noninterest expense was just over billion in the third quarter as a reminder this calculation removes the effects of higher variable compensation due to fee income and corporate performance since asset value changes in our retirement plan and acquisition since the merger of equals as a result core noninterest expense is more comparable to our baseline expenses at the time of the merger close based on the trajectory of ongoing costsave initiatives we are on track to achieve the fourthquarter core expense target i will now provide guidance for the fourth quarter reported net interest margin is expected to decrease to basis points with half attributable to lower purchase accounting accretion and the other half due to increased liquidity and less ppp revenue we expect reported net interest income to decline sequentially entirely due to lower purchase accounting accretion core net interest income is expected to be stable fee income excluding the nonqualified plan is expected to be largely stable from the third quarter as strength of insurance investment banking wealth and cre is offset by lower mortgage revenue and lower sbic valuation gains adjusted noninterest expense is expected to decrease to from the third quarter the primary drivers are personnel expense driven primarily by vsrp occupancy expense and technology costs such as software and equipment expense for those that leverage our core expense target for the fourth quarter to build the adjusted expenses you must add back the impact of acquisitions and higher levels of incentive compensation expense from the higher fees and performance relative to we expect net chargeoff ratio to be to basis points given favorable economic conditions although we expect some normalization of these levels over time finally we expect further reductions in the alll ratio assuming economic conditions remain healthy given all this truist should have positive operating leverage next quarter when compared to the third now ill turn it back to bill to conclude william henry rogers chief executive officer director truist financial corp thanks daryl slide provides an overview of our value proposition maybe the details obviously weve shared in the past now flipping to slide that provides some performance highlights that support our value proposition with actual performance this quarter our markets continue to have strong inmigration the data of which can lag fee income from insurance investment banking and wealth was up yearoveryear and up approximately billion compared to our thirdquarter results clearly reflect the potential for profitability levels to be industry leading as we come out of the merger lastly we continue to deploy more capital on behalf of our clients and shareholders and well have that capacity to do more over time as integration risks subside and the economy stays on sound footing so in conclusion the effects of the pandemic are moderating the economy is getting better we are one major step away from completing our integration process and are beginning to shift from a more defensive to a more offensive position and from a merger focus to a performance focus we fully believe that truists best days are ahead so with that ankur im going to turn it back over to you and qa truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 ankur vyas executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp thanks bill allan at this time if you dont mind explaining how our listeners can participate in the qa session as you do that id like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question one followup so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today question and answer section operator thank you sir operator instructions and like mr vyas said please limit yourselves to one question and one followup question well first go to betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp good morning daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks i had a first question just around the service finance acquisition and i just wanted to understand how youre thinking about leveraging this acquisition from here both on the merchant side as well as on the customer side talking about opportunities for expansion integration into your platform and then on the customer side crosssell william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah betsy its a great question as daryl mentioned we sort of didnt model any of that into the basic models i mean the basic model you saw is sort of a service finance as a standalone one of the really attractive parts of this integration for truist it was the fact that theyve developed relationships with contractors manufacturers just sort of think about that in context or manufacturers think about that in context many of those which are existing clients of truist so weve got this incredible opportunity to expand those relationships they are adding a lot of new clients to our base who are singleproduct clients who weve got an opportunity to expand using things like lightstream and the capabilities that we have theyre using our the prowess of our cib bankers with the manufacturers helping expand with the contractors theres a whole nother component to service finance which is really interesting its the whole esg piece of what theyre doing to create sort of more energy efficiency and the concept of just everything related to home improvement i mean what we really like about service finance its a pure play on the home side so if you think truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 about all the things that we have related to home so think about insurance that we have related to home think about home equity think about mortgage think about all the prowess and product and capabilities we have related to home were just starting to explore those kind of opportunities so this is why we feel so good about this i mean this suggests to us where the bucks go in as i said versus where it is and to your question i think those are significant opportunities ahead of us daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp the only thing i would add to that betsy is that the returns on this it will be eventually over a roa business and our riskadjusted yield will be really attractive william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah just on a standalone yeah exactly daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp standalone basis william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so followup question here daryl on the rate sensitivity you did give us the first basis points and i know the question is going to be what about that second basis points so the first basis points is a really low deposit beta historically i think you mentioned can you remind us what the deposit beta was like on that second basis points thanks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp if you go back to the last rate cycle that we went to it was basically when rates bottomed out the fed moved up times basis points if you look at the deposit betas the first probably two or three deposit betas were probably about plus or minus and then as it continued to climb it was getting closer to to and not sure it ever really got to the in the six moves that you saw there but it kind of gradually went up as every couple moves happened in the last rebound with the fed betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right so you never got like over or anything like that on those last couple of moves daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp no i dont think we ever got to beta on any even move six truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thanks so much operator your next question comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc daryl maybe to start on the expenses so youre reiterating the billion and youre calling for expenses to decline to can you maybe just talk high level about some of the puts and takes on the expenses as we move into clearly the core is coming down due to expense saves but were hearing about cost inflation is increasing you had a handful of insurance deals and insurance finance as well as investments in the business so how should we think about costs into and maybe can they be down on an absolute or an adjusted basis into next year thanks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so were still putting together our plan for but ill tell you what i can tell you now from a cost perspective we have our five buckets that we talk about we definitely will see more branch closures in the first half of with almost more branches closing also well have more less corporate real estate so more reductions in that space as comes along but the big cost savings in technology will happen as we finish through the conversions in the first quarter the decommissioning were going to reduce about of the application systems and move towards from six data centers to three data centers that will be big reductions in cost saves bill talked about our continuation of our vsrp that will continue throughout in then finally we had the team that led synergies program to basically get synergies on expenses and revenues and that will play out over the next couple of years that will assure us to make sure that we get our expense targets and also give us ammunition to make more investments in digital technology and other talent ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and bill last quarter you were talking about green shoots in loan growth and this quarter i think it sounded a little bit more balanced although you are talking about core momentum can you maybe just talk about expectations for loan growth over the next few quarters on both the consumer and the commercial side what do you see are some of the drivers and could we see something like service finance starting to help drive accelerating growth on the consumer side thanks truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah no daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp bill before you start can i finish that so ryan from a still expenses inflation is real and inflation is definitely going to be in our numbers if you look at the last couple of years we did not really factor in inflation in and not sure exactly what that number is but its probably give or take around of the expense base and you also have to factor in acquisitions as well for and the impact of that would have both revenue and expense but at the end of the day were going to have good overall operating leverage probably top quartile when its all said and done william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah thanks for the addition daryl i think to that question ryan thats the focus i mean there are tons of puts and takes but were going to hit the expense target that we committed to i mean i feel very very confident about that and have a business that creates positive operating leverage and industryleading efficiency i mean thats the shift and the target that were headed to i didnt mean to imply that there werent green shoots i still think there are definitely green shoots and i think they manifested themselves in this quarter as we highlighted when i think about loan growth as a output i look at production paydowns utilization and pipelines so i lay those four elements and then try to see where theyre going so on the production side were hitting some high points in the quarter for ci and consumers our production is strong paydowns are staying pretty consistent paydowns are about where they have been utilization is still pretty flat you could say grinding up in certain areas but in fairness probably pretty pretty flat but pipelines are strong i mean in cig and cre and ccb for us were sort of at high points over the last several quarters in pipelines so its hard to guide if i said if you have sort of mediumterm exppp i think lowsingle digit kind of growth is at the forefront but our positioning sort of longerterm when liquidity comes out of this i just feel great about our positioning i mean our capacity to weve grown our revolver so our utilization going up the fantastic markets were in the business investments that weve made in talent the consumer businesses as you pointed out point ofsale businesses things are just adding capabilities and adding more opportunity for us to capture growth as we go forward so yes i think there are green shoots hard to predict sort of when theyre going to grow but i feel really really good about how were positioned ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks for all the color bill operator all right next question will come from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc a truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 gerard operator hey gerard your line might be on mute please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you it was on mute i appreciate it good morning gentlemen bill william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you share with us youve done some smaller acquisitions obviously the most recent one is the finance company and then the insurance companies can you give us your picture of what you see maybe for added bolt on opportunities that could be on the horizon for truist william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah id sort of say first as core truist i think the biggest opportunity is with truist i see the biggest opportunity to actualize and optimize the opportunity that came from this fantastic merger of equals so let me sort of say that as its primary where were going but then the bolton clearly on the insurance side i mean weve had a fantastic track record on the insurance side it is a really good toggle between organic and inorganic growth and managed well and i would expect that to continue maybe other things that look around and sort of bolton that are important to us strategically and add some scale weve been adding a lot of talent i view that as the equivalent of an acquisition so weve been adding talent and you see the benefits of that for example in the investment banking side but i think its be fair to say bolton in the places where were experienced or where we have opportunity and then primary emphasis on truist and maximizing and optimizing this merger gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you and maybe this question could be directed to clarke the credit quality for you and many of your peers has been outstanding particularly in the net chargeoff area can you guys give us a flavor how sustainable are these levels of very low net chargeoffs is it another two or three quarters and then maybe creeping up to normalization as we enter or end of clarke r starnes iii a chief risk officer truist financial corp its a great question gerard i know this is a lower or longer question for the industry and i would say for us in the industry we had significant stimulus accommodation programs and frankly strong asset values and all of those have been tailwinds and you saw for us almost really historic ph low loss point for the quarter so we feel really good about where we are and given the current economic backdrop we would certainly expect truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 to continue to see outperformance with to your point a steady return over time to normalization as we go into and beyond and so i think it can go on longer and it again depends on the economic scenario but for us right now i think we would believe we have an opportunity to outperform and you will that reflected in our guidance gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hi guys good morning hey bill william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp good morning ken usdin q analyst jefferies company just when you think longer term out about the points you made about operating leverage efficiency maybe theres some inflation the business mix has changed how confident do you remain in that low longterm efficiency ratio and how much if at all is rates still part of that equation thanks william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah i mean i would start with industryleading efficiency so let me sort of start with that as a concept i think given some normalization of rates i feel really confident in the low but most importantly being able to achieve positive operating leverage being able to sort of be industryleading top or top quartile efficiency i think is eminently short medium and longterm achievable for truist ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay got it and then just on the nearterm perspective can you just daryl can you just walk us through when we take the ph million and million in the slides and you kind of add back the addbacks where approximately just to put as a starting point for the end of the year on a gaap basis for cost daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so if you go back you have to add back in incentive pieces the acquisition pieces as well as whatever nonqualified turns out to be plus or minus you probably get to we gave guidance on an adjusted expense number down to from where we are today that kind of is your starting off point for truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay got it and then we add back intangibles for the allin okay daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp thats correct ken usdin q analyst jefferies company thank you operator all right next question will come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so bill you took over as ceo about a month ago and also announced some changes to the senior leadership team obviously all of you guys have been in very prominent roles since the deal was announced i wouldnt expect meaningful changes but any kind of tweaks that we should expect or kind of what was the process of picking who kind of does what underneath you given some of the changes however you want to frame that thank you william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah i mean the great thing matt is we have an incredibly strong skilled experienced purposeful team so im really fortunate to be surrounded by really great leaders as you noted i mean we didnt want to put a lot of change in place because actually i feel really good about the momentum and where things are going so the leaders who are responsible for those businesses we shifted a couple things around but they still have the primary responsibility that they had before id say that the shift was more what i talked about in my opening statements its more of a transition from merging to operating that doesnt have anything to do with me or anything just has to do with the timing of where we are in this process getting this major conversion this weekend was just a shot of adrenaline for us to be fair i mean thats a big significant milestone for us and just gives us more confidence to be starting to shift some of our time some of our responsibilities some of our focus to maximizing the opportunities that are truist truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 so i would say if i were to describe the transition and what it feels like maybe different now is that its more of that and i just think thats a function of timing and where we are and our confidence building matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just separately can you talk about the retention of some of the kind of front office clientfacing folks really across the franchise i would imagine initially there just wasnt that much movement because of covid and i think you also had some retention agreements for key people but just update us on how thats been going kind of more recently as things have been opening up and maybe people in general are more open to looking elsewhere not just at truist but the workplace overall william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah let me put maybe a global perspective on it and then try to get a little more idiosyncratic to truist so globally theres more activity and more people are moving and we see that particularly in some of the frontline areas and you dont drive around any place in the country where you dont see help wanted sign and weve got several million people out of the workforce right now so we and the industry are experiencing some of that going into this merger our retention numbers in the first year to months were actually better than they were at either company so our retention numbers were really really good turnover spiked up a little bit but its still i think below where the industry is from everything that we can determine as it relates to some of our most senior team and what we sort of look at highperformer turnover is one of the things that we look at in our senior team ive been really pleased i mean weve been really solid in keeping the kind of players we want the retention on those has been really good the places that i worry about are frontline teller care centers all those things thats just a more challenging environment today than it was before and the other side of that is our ability to attract talent is fantastic i mean the people that have wanted to join our company and want to be part of what were doing at truist has exceeded any expectations that i might have had and they were really really high so the opportunity for people that are here to grow and expand their careers and the opportunity to bring new talent in i think is just really really good at truist all that again with that sort of global overlay of whats going on in the market in the world matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc understood thank you operator okay next question will come from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi bill youve spoken a lot about investing in technology and digital and i think the expenses were a little elevated before youve taken over the ceo reigns so its good seeing that youre guiding for expenses to be to lower next quarter but can you just talk i think it was your quote saying once the hoods open lets fix the engine a little bit more than we could have otherwise done so where is the digital dividend so to speak going to come from as it relates to truist and the extra efforts that youre putting in place so if you can talk about the truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 back office with the cloud or the front office with enhanced digital banking that you maybe didnt have before thanks william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah mike its a great question and i think about in two ways one digital dividend as you put it but also the avoidance of opportunity cost and thats really whats happened with this merger so if you think about it in sort of a core basis were creating a much more agile platform so the ability to move fast to add to create more opportunities for our clients our teammates on a more agile platform so the base is really important i then think we have a new stateoftheart commercial ecosystem we have a new stateoftheart mortgage ecosystem we have a new stateoftheart digital platform all of those in my mind are opportunity costs so those are things we dont have to invest in disproportionately going forward and it create the opportunity to expand and add too as we go into the next few years the other part of that is something we call the digital straddle this thing that we did to convert our clients digitally i think is actually fairly unique and what that allows us to do again from an agility standpoint is to leverage that backend platform and we can through the use of apis in the straddle we can do a whole lot more for our clients than we could before so when the hood is up yeah weve been looking at sort of virtually everything so the hood up and the best of both mentality has allowed us to not only expand and create a better ecosystem but i also look at it as it avoid a lot of opportunity cost in the future of having to do these major major changes mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so you said you still youre still committed i guess to low efficiency it just seems like its been a long way i mean the stocks underperformed since the merger was announced despite a merger on paper that has the chance to be one of the best mergers ever and i think part of the reason for the underperformance may have been we had the pandemic we had the low rates so there are some excuses there but looking ahead are you able to commit to positive operating leverage next year given the weight given all these investments i mean youre avoiding costs youre getting gains from the technology investments i think investors are kind of thinking okay lets see more of that digital dividend lets see more of that payoff how much can you lead us or give a little bit more hope as it relates to positive operating leverage william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp maybe i have a little more than hope so no no i think its totally reasonable to expect us to have a positive operating for next year in the middle of this merger and thats against investments we want to make thats overcoming inflation thats overcoming all the other things that exist rate environment pandemic all those type things now were committed to having a business that has positive operating leverage and has industryleading efficiency i mean i feel more confident about that today than i did the day we announced the merger so its sometimes hard to peel back the clouds and the merger costs and the onetimes and all that to see that but the underlying capacity of our company to deliver positive operating leverage growth on the top line and worldclass efficiency is absolutely there truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right so next year positive operating leverage and that youre committed to that and this is your first earnings call as a ceo so did i hear that correctly william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp that is absolutely what will be in our plan for next year mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you very much operator all right next well go to john mcdonald with autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research morning daryl just wanted to clarify the outlook for net interest income next quarter i think you said on a reported basis down on a core net interest income flattish just clarify if that was the guide and then how does that set you up more broadly for growing nii into when you think about all the puts and takes there daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so you are correct we will have stable nii and the core basis in the fourth quarter will be down just because of purchase accounting accretion as plays out when i look at as we put this together there are three big drivers of nii the impacts will be loan growth deposit growth depending on how large the balance sheet gets and how much liquidity we invest and then interest rates when i look at all that i think its very possible that im very sure that the core net interest income will grow i think we have a chance of having it offset overall the runoff for purchase accounting it doesnt take a huge amount of loan growth coupled with a fed move thats not in the implied right now but even a steepening of the yield curve would add so if you just steepen the yield curve like basis points that would give us another million in for the year next year so i think theres a lot of variables that could play out but we feel pretty good that trajectory of core net interest margin will rise in and that our reported net interest margin should be relatively stable if we can offset that john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and bill just a bigger picture question in terms of the capital target and what you need to run the company you brought down the capital target cet1 to it seems like youll get there with the service finance acquisition soon so longer term what will be the factors as you think about lowering that capital to maybe something closer to what shares that look like you target on cet1 william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2021 yeah and john remember we also announced well do some more share repurchase this quarter so to get there faster i mean we said all along i mean we went into the merger with a little bit of a higher capital base very intentionally and what we said was is the risk of the merger decreases and the solid definition of the economy increases we have a company that has a lowerthanaverage risk profile and a higherthanaverage ppnr profile so i think well start thinking about capital positions that reflect that we dont want to do this on a quarterbyquarter basis i mean this is sort of a longterm strategy and philosophy but this weekend was a good milestone for us in terms of reducing the risk of the merger and our confidence of where we are in the first part of next year well get that behind us and well continue to evaluate where we are from a capital standpoint no reason to think were going to change the profile of our company our diversifications our risk profile is going to stay strong and were confident in the ph ppr components of the growth in our business john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it okay great so yeah not quarter to quarter but getting through the conversions will be a big factor as you think about lowering that target over time william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah i think youve got it i think weve got to be in the first part of next year to have another conversation about this but were going to be thoughtful and moving to the existing target quickly john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it thank you william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp indiscernible
