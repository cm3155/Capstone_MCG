thanks alan and good morning everybody thank you very much for joining our call we had overall i consider a strong quarter with strong earnings and returns very good expense control strong fee income especially in insurance and investment banking excellent asset quality which clarke will talk about really good progress on merger integration and excellent internal recognitions including an outstanding cra rating for our community development effort if youre following along on slide we always like to focus on the most important which is our culture as youve heard us say many times we continue to reiterate culture is the primary determinant of our longterm success our purpose really connects with our teammates weve been really excited about this our teammates are driven to really help our clients we really enjoy serving our communities and our shareholders even with covid weve made great progress in activating our culture created a culture council which works every day with our ph el team causing our culture to really come alive so weve made excellent progress in terms of culture which is ultimately the driver on slide just a couple of points and some things that i think are good with regard to how were serving our communities we were very excited to be the first issuer of a social bond of the us regional bank billion bond that was well well received investors very favorable pricing were very excited about that in terms of our ability to focus on affordable housing and other community needs truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 we became the lead investor for greenwood which was very excited and innovative digital banking platform designed for black and latino consumers and business owners we signed the hispanic promise a first of its kind national pledge to prepare hire promote retain and celebrate hispanics in the workplace and we received score on human rights campaigns corporate equality index and we were named best place to work in we also continued to make great progress in terms of executing on our billion community benefits agreement and we already hit of our annual target we were very proud to be recognized once again by fortune as one of the worlds most admired companies on slide just a few indicators for you about how well the merger is going i just want to point out to you that the risk of executing our merger has already been reduced substantially and is going down daily as we do conversions and were getting a lot of the actual merger work done a huge amount of work has already been done on the core bank conversion and youll see in the bubble chart there that a number of conversions has already been done for example truist securities conversion wealth brokerage conversion we did a huge amount of work in terms of grading all of the truist jobs and that has all been executed were already in the process of testing protocols for our core bank conversion our wealth trust conversion is well along occurring in just a few weeks so you can see that were making tremendous progress and i just want to emphasize the point that for those who think that the risk is going to remain high and wont subside until we do the final branch conversion that is not a good way to look at it the risk of being mitigated daily as we do these various conversions and make progress in terms of preparing for the final conversion we did close branches in the first quarter which was part of our strategy we have been very very happy with our teammate reaction to that theyre very very engaged recall that we promised all of our clientfacing performing teammates that they would not lose their jobs and so its going very very well and our clients are very supportive because remember most of these branches are very very close to each other and so its no inconvenience to our clients we are very focused on meeting our expense targets which daryl will talk about and we believe we will be able to accomplish that just a few performance highlights on and i think it was a very very good quarter we had strong adjusted net income of billion or per share adjusted both up versus the first quarter of we had adjusted rotce of recall that we said our midterm target was in the low so we are well on the way to achieving that already and we have huge cost savings yet to come we recorded investment banking and trading income at a record level along with insurance it was offset some by decreases in residential mortgage income and commercial real estate related income strong expense discipline as our adjusted noninterest expense decreased million most sequentially and our merger related and restructuring charges decreased million we significantly had lower provision for credit losses of million versus million in the fourth quarter so we had a reserve release of million clarke will talk about that more if we have questions npas decreased million or which we were very happy about we completed million of share repurchases so we had a total payout for the quarter of about we did redeem million of preferred truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 stock during the quarter at an after tax cost of million or per share which was not excluded in terms of our adjustment to net income so overall if you look at slide youll see how the adjustments with the mergerrelated charges having a diluting impact of incremental operating expenses related to the merger that are not in our ongoing recurring charges going forward was and an acceleration for cash flow hedge unwind expense of so overall it was a very strong quarter across a wide array of performance areas importantly we continue to execute on our t3 concept which is the concept of seamless integrating technology and touch so that we yield a high level of trust creating a very high value proposition which is providing excellent client focus which is ultimately the most important factor in terms of judging our current and our future performance now let me turn it to bill for some additional detail bill william henry rogers jr president chief operating officer director truist financial corp great kelly thank you and good morning everyone as you can see from page our clients continue to adopt digital at a rapid pace since last march the population of active mobile app users has increased to more than million users and that marks an important milestone along our digital journey at the company were absolutely committed to meeting our clients where they are and increasingly these interactions are happening in the digital space our digital commerce data bear this out as digital client needs met have improved since the first quarter of and represent more than onethird of total bank production of core bank products this percentage is even higher when you include lightstream and mortgage as we accompany clients along their digital journey we often interact with them across multiple digital products and services mobile check deposits and zelle are two examples both of which were up significantly from a year ago and this just creates additional opportunities to deepen those relationships importantly the increase in digital transaction activity allows our teammates to spend less time on manual execution and more time assessing and meeting client needs enabled by our integrated relationship management were also excited about the new truist digital experience thats rolling out to our clients later this year in order to complete the digital migration ahead of the core bank conversion were utilizing an innovative proprietary approach known as a digital straddle the digital straddle allows us to migrate clients to the new digital experience in waves reducing migration risk as kelly discussed earlier and avoiding a onetime migration early next year we recently launched a successful internal pilot of our new digital experience and expect to migrate our clients on a series of waves during the third and fourth quarter let me now turn to slide and talk about loans first quarter balance sheet dynamics reflected a combination of mild loan demand ongoing government stimulus and elevated liquidity average loans decreased billion compared to the fourth quarter primarily due to a billion reduction in commercial balances and billion of residential mortgage runoff the decrease in commercial loan balance was primarily attributable to lower revolver utilization and continued paydown of ppp loans which outpaced new loan commitments approximately billion of ppp loans were repaid during the quarter impacting average commercial balances by billion revolver utilization remained low as clients continued to hold elevated liquidity and access to capital markets in addition the dealer floor portfolio continues to experience headwinds related to supply chain disruptions average truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 consumer loans decreased billion as ongoing refinance activity impacted residential mortgage home equity and direct loan balances these declines though were partially offset by higher indirect auto balances which benefited from strong production especially in the prime segment we made a conscious decision in support of our purpose to lean in on ppp loans and weve been the largest lender in many of our markets and while revolver utilization is at an alltime lows our commitments are steady also acknowledged that our prime mortgage portfolio is more susceptible to higher prepayments we recognize these are headwinds but were also optimistic that given vaccination rates government stimulus and our own view of productivity and pipelines all supported economic recovery and corresponding core loan growth let me switch to the next page and talk about deposits average deposits increased billion sequentially and are up more than billion from the first quarter of reflecting government stimulus and pandemicrelated client behaviors average balances increased across all deposit categories except time deposits while the largest increases were in interest checking and money market and savings the deposit mix remains favorable as noninterest bearing accounts represent one third of total deposits truist continues to experience strong deposit growth while maximizing our value proposition to clients outside of rate paid as we continue to experience net new household growth during the first quarter average total deposits cost decreased basis points to basis points and average interest bearing deposit costs declined basis points to basis points due to new stimulus were up double digits in total deposits since the quarter end and with that let me turn it over to daryl to discuss the overall financial performance daryl n bible chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you bill and good morning everybody continuing on slide net interest income decreased million linked quarter due to fewer days lower purchase accounting accretion and lower earning asset yields reported net interest margin was down basis points reflecting a 4basis point impact from lower purchase accounting accretion core net interest margin decreased basis points as deposit inflows resulted in higher combined fed balances and securities interest sensitivity decreased slightly as the investment portfolio grew in response to the elevated liquidity turning to slide noninterest income decreased million despite record income from insurance and investment banking and trading insurance income increased million linked quarter reflecting seasonality million from recent acquisitions and million due to a timing change related to certain employee benefit accounts organic revenue grew due to strong new business stable retention and higher property and casualty rates investment banking and trading rose million benefiting from strength in high yield investment grade and equity originations as well as a recovery in cva residential mortgage income decreased million due to lower production margins and volumes commercial real estate income decreased million due to seasonality and strong fourth quarter transaction activity other income was down million as lower partnership income was partially offset by gains from a divestiture continuing on slide expense discipline remained strong in the first quarter noninterest expense was down million linked quarter reflecting million decrease in mergerrelated and restructuring charges adjusted truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 noninterest expense decreased million primarily due to lower professional fees and nonservice related pension costs offset by personnel expense personnel expense increased million reflecting higher equity based compensation higher incentive compensation and payroll tax resets partially offset by lower salaries and wages turning to slide we are taking full advantage of our unique opportunity to build the best of both franchise the best of both is harder to execute in a typical acquisition but we are convinced that the client benefits and internal efficiencies justify the effort and expense as we said in january we continue to expect total combined merger costs of approximately billion this consists of mergerrelated and restructuring charges of approximately billion and incremental operating expenses related to the merger of approximately billion these costs are not in the future run rate and will come out in after we complete the core bank conversion and decommission redundant systems since the merger was announced we have incurred billion of mergerrelated and restructuring charges and million incremental operating expenses related to the merger continuing on slide strong asset quality matrix remains relatively stable reflecting diversification benefits from the merger and effective problem asset resolution nonperforming assets were down million or basis points as a percentage of total loans largely driven by decreases in the commercial and industrial portfolio net chargeoff came in basis points which was at the lower end of the guidance range linked quarter increase was mostly driven by seasonality in indirect to auto the provision for credit losses was million including a reserve release of million due to lower loan balances and improved economic outlook the allowance for credit losses was relatively stable at of loans and leases our exposure of covidsensitive industries was essentially flat at billion turning to slide truist has strong capital and ended the first quarter with a cet1 ratio of with respect to capital return we paid a common dividend of per share and had million of share buybacks we also redeemed million of preferred stock resulting in an aftertax charge of million or per share that was not excluded from the adjusted results we have billion in repurchase authorization remaining under the share repurchase program the board approved in december we intend to maintain approximate cet1 ratio after taking into account strategic actions stock repurchases and changes in riskweighted assets as a result we anticipate second quarter repurchases of about million we continue to have strong liquidity and are ready to meet the needs of our clients and communities continuing on slide this slide shows excellent progress towards the net cost saves of billion through the first quarter we reduced sourceable spend and are closing in on our target in terms of retail banking we closed branches in the first quarter bringing the cumulative closures to we are on track to close approximately branches by the first quarter of we reduced our nonbranch facilities by approximately million square feet and are making progress towards the overall target of approximately million square feet average ftes are down since the merger announcement we expect technology savings of million by the end of compared to we continue to look at these expense buckets and are broadening to look at other across the board we are highly committed to our billion cost savings target truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 continuing to slide the waterfall on the left shows that we measured core expenses and cost savings beginning with adjusted noninterest expense and then adjusting for the nonqualified plan and the insurance acquisition expenses we arrive at a core expense of billion if you adjust for seasonality of high payroll taxes equity compensation and variable commissions core expenses would approach fourth quarter target of billion sic billion our adjusted return on tangible common equity was for the first quarter we maintained our mediumterm performance and cost saving targets for and further moderation of the merger and economic risk may enable us to revisit our target cet1 ratio now i will provide guidance for the second quarter expressed in linked quarter changes we expect taxable equivalent revenue excluding security gains to be relatively flat we expect reported noninterest margin to be down high single digits driven by a midsingledigit decrease in core margin and to basis points of purchase accounting accretion writeoff noninterest income should be relatively flat due to the growth of the balance sheet noninterest expense adjusted for merger costs and amortization expected to be relatively flat we anticipate net chargeoffs in the range of to basis points and a tax rate between to as we look out into improving economic conditions may allow for further reserve releases overall we had a strong quarter including excellent expense management and strong asset quality now let me hand it back to bill for an update on irm william henry rogers jr president chief operating officer director truist financial corp thanks daryl and im going to take us to page im going to take this opportunity to share our progress on integrated relationship management and share two examples of what we call natural fit businesses working together to benefit our clients when truist was formed we said wed create value by combining our distinctive clientfocused banking experiences with greater investment in technology and a stronger mix of financial services offerings as kelly noted earlier we call this approach t3 touch integrated with technology equals trust were confident in the strategy because it really builds on truists strengths those strengths include industry leading client service and loyalty an advicebased business model differentiated offerings including truist securities truist insurance holdings and the truist leadership institute and leading technology like our mobile banking app integrated relationship management is a framework for putting t3 into practice across truist through all of our lines of businesses and most importantly for all of our clients we start with the client understand their needs and engage our business partners through our common technologybased referral and accountability process as mentioned we have natural synergies which is the relationship between commercial community bank and truist securities this business is by nature a little lumpy and episodic driven by client needs but were very pleased with our momentum referrals are up by a factor of in one year and have more than doubled since the last quarter we continue to train bankers and are increasing both in number and quality of referrals as we share client wins teammates gain confidence and motivation to fully leverage all the tools that we have for the benefit of their ph light clients moving to slide ill discuss the effort of truist securities and truist insurance holdings and the relationship with heritage suntrust clients in particular referrals to insurance have increased more than times compared truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 to the first quarter of and more than sequentially weve aligned systems and trained around similar practice groups which allows us to double down on industry expertise for our clients i can really speak from experience that this was a real area of excitement from heritage suntrust and this is really just in the early stages of growth so integrated relationship management is working its been embraced fully by our teammates its in support of our clients and a distinguishable benefit for our shareholders keep in mind this is a long game but you do see the beginning of this incremental opportunity in the overall insurance and investment banking results even in this quarter so kelly let me turn now back over to you kelly s king chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thank you bill i appreciate that so on slide i just want to point out and reemphasize our value proposition we believe it is a very strong value proposition driven by our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities we have an exceptional franchise with diverse products services and markets some of the best in the world we are uniquelypositioned to deliver bestinclass efficiency and returns while investing in the future and youre seeing that happening already we have very strong capital and liquidity position with very strong resilience in terms of our risk profile enhanced by the merger so we have a growing earnings stream with less volatility relative to many of our peers over the long term so if you think about the quarter and all and overall and ramping up ill just say again i think it was a very strong quarter these are very interesting and challenging times but look things are getting better covid is getting better its too soon to declare that its over but hospitalization rates are down and infection rates are down and vaccines are getting out really really fast so were encouraged by that the economy is clearly improving we have said before and i would reemphasize we believe as we head into the second half we will have a snapback economy this economy was not wounded before we headed into this we simply shut it down for appropriate reasons now were beginning to see the opportunities that we believe could happen which is turning it back on is easier than it might have been on the other types of economic crises that weve seen so truist is positioned really really well we have a great culture we have great markets we have a great team we have a great purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities and is creating really engaged teammates we have real benefits from the merger that are being realized every single day youve heard some of those we have very strong performance in t3 and irm as bill described and thats really powerful the merger integration is on track we are reducing risk every single day its all going really really well we believe we have the opportunity to accelerate into what i consider to be a very positive snapback economy we fully believe our best days are ahead alan alan greer investor relations truist financial corp okay thank you kelly katie at this time if you will come back on the line and explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well go first to gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning kelly bill how are you kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you share with us if you look at the credit outlook for your company and the industry weve seen an incredible reduction in the credit cycle because of the policies pursued by the federal reserve and the us government last year can you guys give us your thoughts on how you see credit cycles going forward are they permanently potentially flattened because of what we saw last year or is this just such an aberration that we shouldnt really read into what were seeing with this lowered flatter credit cycle kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp i would say and clarke he may have some detail on that gerard i dont believe this eliminates ongoing long term credit cycles i mean i think to believe that you would have to believe that we have somehow fixed the economy and fixed the nature of humans making decisions and humans getting greedy and humans indulging in excesses i do not believe that has gone away nor will it go away once we flush through these massive amounts of stimulus into the economy we will undoubtedly see some excesses itll likely lead to some corrections down the road that nobody is projecting now and i dont project it in like two or three years but there will be some excesses created out of all this excessive money into the system so we have had a heading into the pandemic we had about a 10year kind of steady economy most people would say and including myself that we were probably heading into correction now weve had what will be two or three years of covid experience we havent had a indiscernible excesses that will flow in two or three years so well end up with about a or 16year protracted period of relatively stable ph exile the blip from covid but then well go back to fairly normal kind of economic variations in my view clarke what do you think clarke r starnes iii a chief risk officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 totally agree the credit stress was resulting from the shutdown of the economy not underlying credit considerations that you would normally see so weve been around a long time credit cycles will come and go lending involves inherent risks youre going to have a credit cycle in the future so thats why you always have to stick to your longterm underwriting principles and you can never forget there will be another credit cycle so i agree kelly gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you and as william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp and maybe just to add to that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah go ahead bill yeah william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp gerard maybe just add to that is keeping our diversified balance sheet is the key to that so were not going to lose our discipline and ph blink because of this cycle and we want to anticipate a highlydiversified business and a strong capital base to fulfill our value proposition gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup your franchise obviously is located in some of the stronger economies in the us particularly economies that are more open than some of the coastal economies in the north can you share with us the outlook for if you look beyond the current quarter and look out into the second half of the year about loan growth and loan demand i know theres excess of liquidity you touched on that kelly what do you guys see the turning points where you could see an acceleration of loan growth possibly in the third or fourth quarters of this year william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp yeah gerard ill take that i think first of all what you noted is exactly right about our franchise i mean i think whatever happens and whenever it happens i think well be disproportionately positively benefited so i think well sort of be the first in that cycle and we see that not only in the face of the markets being more open but just the migration i mean the migration of companies and the migration of individuals i dont think thats quite showing up in the data yet but thats got to show up because we absolutely absolutely feel that that being said if we start someones saying the second quarter is the starting period for loan growth i think its reasonable to think thats sort of core loan growth lets exclude ppp from that because were a little over weighted in ppp so weve got pay downs related to that but if we look at core loan growth i think we have reason to be positive for the latter part of the year in virtually all of our businesses truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 so maybe cre ph being the lone example on the opposite side but core ci and then the growth in mortgage and then businesses like lightstream and indirect auto and others that are more positively inclined so i think your general premise is right and i think we are wellpositioned and i think thats a latter half of the year phenomenon gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator thank you well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi the specific question is can you give an update on the annualized cost savings as a percentage of the ultimate target it was million annualized in the fourth quarter versus the target of billion and along with that youre still sticking to billion of expenses by the fourth quarter thats down despite an increase in volumebased expenses such as for insurance and capital markets and why is that and if thats the case why wouldnt you be upping your ultimate merger expense saving target daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah mike thats a great question if you take our on the slide that we had in the deck and look at what our core expenses are the billion and if you back out the seasonality that we had in the first quarter to the payroll tax resets and the equity thats about million there were probably at billion give or take a little bit there we did have higher incentives higher incentives this quarter were really driven by our performance in revenues and just overall great performance throughout the company so i kind of carve that out but from a core perspective i think we continue to make good progress we are totally committed to getting to the billion that we talked about last quarter were on track to get there if you noticed in our comments we said were looking at these five buckets but were also broadening out and looking at other areas as well and we are going to hit our targets for sure and if we exceed those targets we will continue to make good investments in the company to continue to compete and win in the industry mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay before i use up my second question so the million annualized have you updated that for the first quarter or no daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp when you say updated it we really just gave targets for the fourth quarter its going to be lumpy but its hard to project a trajectory down every quarter just because of you have a real business thats dynamic and moving but truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 we made good progress from fourth quarter to first quarter and we will get our target by the fourth quarter this year mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and the second question since insurance is such a standout i have our firms insurance analyst elyse greenspan to ask the followup elyse greenspan q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah thanks mike so i was hoping to get some color within insurance on the organic growth its ph up to in the quarter on the last quarters call you guys had pointed to for the first half of the year so i guess whats coming in better than you had expected and how do you see the rest of the year progressing from here christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp sure elyse this is chris henson we did have a very exciting organic growth number the elements of it would be pricing retention and new business so i would say pricing was not a what i would call a continued surprise we bounced increased around we think rates are generally going to we anticipate it to continue increasing throughout retention we did level off in retail so were just under we were having a little drift down as you know were in a that time of the market where a lot of that risk gets shifted to the wholesale segment wholesale is actually up to so retention actually continued to perform just maybe a touch better but we do continue to see that shift to wholesale new business would be an area i would point to that might have been a brighter spot than we would have seen a quarter ago new business production was up which is very solid and what we saw in the quarter was every month that got better february was better than january march was better than february et cetera and thats kind of what drove the organic and i would also piggyback on the comment bill made earlier irm is actually is real its having an impact and when we say that theyre linked pretty heavily to the commercial community bank cig wealth the retail community bank were actually spending time talking about that and making sure we have alignment expectations in place and thats having a marginal impact as well in terms of outlook the second quarter wed expect commissions to be up about were moving out of the first quarter which is our second highest quarter of the year into our seasonally strongest which is  and certainly while theres still uncertainties with covid and impact its going to have on the economy et cetera we think the outlook is still very positive in this business because we think were going to continue to see increased pricing we havent seen a lot of failures in the business so we think were going to continue to see stable exposure units es volumes are still strong so and given that we are diversified in both wholesale and retail it really helps us in this type of market truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 so we think pricing momentum will be a ph continuing catalyst for all the reasons we talked about covid ph cap losses et cetera and in this quarter pricing being up in the range it was flat with  we did see an umbrella in excess of do of for example professional liability up but another area where weve been hit disproportionately is commercial property commercial property was up we have a lot of that thats very helpful to us and coverage is all coverage classes about half of the coverage classes were up and all account sizes were up in the to kind of range so i would say for the next quarter outlook would be midsingledigit organic growth even given the uncertainties so there we feel very solid about that as we kind move through and we think theres upside in terms of the economy continued benefit to driving even stronger new business and i think we continue to mature as bill pointed out with respect to our ph earn process and that gives us really good positive hope as well we did close one small acquisition in the quarter and we certainly expect to be open to do more of those throughout the balance of the year as well so on balance we feel really good about the prospects for the balance of operator thank you well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hey betsy daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp hey betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc just the first question i just wanted to make sure i understood the expense guide for because i think you mentioned daryl relatively flat qonq and i wanted to understand if that was right and maybe some of the things that youre thinking about that keep it flat instead of maybe coming down a little bit daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah betsy in my prepared remarks we did say that we thought expenses was and the adjusted basis backing out the merger and restructuring the incremental moe would come in relatively flat and i think we continue to make good progress in the buckets that were showing and we are starting to broaden out in other areas truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 and we will have higher revenue and fees in certain areas just because of seasonal strength in the second quarter but netnet we feel pretty good on how the quarters going to come in and from an expense perspective i think were on a good trajectory and were going to hit our targets betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and so you from what im hearing from the prior conversation too is that the expense improvement acceleration is picking up as you move through the year daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp that would be the anticipation betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then just separately on the revenue side i know you havent baked in the revenue synergies but i just wanted to get a sense as to whether or not you could speak to what youre seeing so far in terms of picking up new accounts or expanding the product set of the accounts that youre with relative to what maybe your budgets or goals have been so far i know covid kind of put a wrench in that but maybe you could speak to how youre migrating at this stage william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp yeah betsy its bill i think as i said earlier you see that in the core results amidst of the penetration that were experiencing the referral volume that were experiencing you probably see it most acutely in the results in investment banking and in insurance but its really sort of look at some of the overall revenue line its really everywhere i mean so weve been careful about pointing out one specific revenue synergy against one specific thing because thats not the goal the goal is to expand all of our relationships the goal is to listen to our clients put an integrated system together have it the a highly technology supported one platform with really good accountability and strong teammate indiscernible and thats the value proposition so i think the real answer is just see it in the overall results again i pointed out too that were more acutely obvious but literally in all of our businesses you see the advantages of what were implementing as part of the truist value proposition christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp betsy indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc as you truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp on to that so betsy i just want to tag on to say that in the commercial community bank for example we saw referral activity up this past quarter which is a really good number in household growth and all the commercial segments so i think its a function of what bill was saying were just beginning to see movements sort of across the board betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay yeah that was kind of my question in particular post as weve been reopening do you feel like that has been picking up and then i can hear in your answer it seems like the answer is yes william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp so yeah yeah absolutely yeah that thats the other part of your question yeah thats to the i think were again experiencing that a little disproportionately were probably leading the country in terms of reopening and reactivity and we feel that in virtually all of our business christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp we came into the first quarter of last year with a lot of excitement and then second quarter with covid we all just sort of hit a wall but the excitement sort of perseveres through the balance of the year and were just saying and i think bill would agree just consistent improvement sort of monthonmonth betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thank you operator thank you well take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi can you guys talk a bit about your strategy of deploying liquidity in the securities last quarter you purchased a lot of securities a little bit less this quarter whats kind of just the philosophy and capacity as we look forward daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah right now matt what we are doing is we are investing our excess liquidity that weve gotten in from our deposits were averaging about billion at the fed which we think is a comfortable cushion to basically handle any volatility we might get there the investments were making is a combination of mortgagebacked securities and us treasuries we are averaging up a little bit on the yields that we have on the portfolio that we have out there today from that perspective i think the way we think about it is were going to have a liquidity for a fair amount of time and were going to have cash flows and kind of dovetailing into what bill said earlier that the best thing that could happen truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 to us is loan growth starts to pick up second quarter into the second half of the year when we basically basic run off some securities that are in the mid1 ranges and we reinvest them into loans in the to or range and basically keep the balance sheet about the same size and just improve our revenue and earnings overall so i think that would be the strategy for us to do that if for whatever reason that the fed starts to shrink their balance sheet and liquidity comes out you got to remember we have billion to billion of cash flows coming off this portfolio every quarter that we can absorb anything so i think were taking good balance risks our target right now is to keep net interest income even with a runoff of purchase accounting flat for the next several quarters and hopefully that will pick up towards the end of the year as we get meaningful loan growth matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks and then i just want to followup on the last question indiscernible question regarding revenue synergies i understand kind of pushing at all the businesses and not trying to necessarily kind of track it separately but as we think longerterm and the opportunities become a little more apparent and i guess im thinking loan growth picks up and theres some loans that legacy bbt offered that suntrust didnt and vice versa it would seem like the numbers could start being a little more material and i do want to see if over time you might provide more details on the magnitude of the synergies so far youve talked about kind of capital market sizing for that in the fourth quarter but bringing it all together over time is that something youd consider kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp matt i think we will definitely do that were trying to provide you know timely information on the most marginally important issues but as bill and chris illustrated we really have a broadbased opportunity not just loan deposits all types of fee income we are really just scratching the surface the reason we keep emphasizing this ph irm concept is because that is the most powerful concept and we think we have an edge on that because it focuses on all of the clients needs all of the time we build a culture where everybody works together we build systems to allow for information to be integrated across organizational boundaries and so yes youre right i think you can be positive in terms of expected revenue enhances as we go forward as we begin to penetrate more of our clients needs matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator thank you well take our next question from erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch my first question is as we think about the prospects for loan growth bouncing back for the rest of the year could you remind us how many of your clients are either noninvestment grade or dont have a debt rating i guess the big struggle investors have is the capital markets are wide open private equity firms continue to be aggressive in private credit and sort of wondering what that universe is of your clients that potentially would need a bank balance sheet in order to expand william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp yeah erika this is bill the key is to have a really balanced portfolio so we have a good number of clients who wont access the capital markets thats sort of that core strength of that middle market community banking model and theyll use bank loans as their primary avenue for growth then you see the other side of that i dont think thats the only equation if rates go up certainly on the long end you can see large corporates going back to bank loans they are the most efficient way of borrowing weve got a lot of revolvers out just a little bit of revolver utilization increase is a pretty significant loan driver for us so i dont think we necessarily think about it as the noninvestment grade and the investment grade in terms of a separation we think about it in terms of the balanced portfolio and we drive it from the client needs so if the client wants capital markets and thats the most efficient way we have great access and great capability and great products for those that want to have a bank product weve got a great portfolio of those type middle market clients and were able to serve them so i think our optimism is really predicated on just this concept of a balanced portfolio one versus the other does that make sense erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch yes it does and i think bill thats a great point on long rates rising and revolvers becoming more attractive i think that point hasnt been made as vocally so thank you for that and the followup question is clearly consumers and corporates are awash with cash do you expect that those cash balances have to be drawn before corporates especially relever or are your clients telling you that theyre going to keep a little bit more cash on hand given what they went through during the pandemic kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp erika i think everybody is trying to figure out the answer to that question youve got consumer and business ill comment on business and chris can comment on consumer i think what youre going to see is that businesses are going to end up maintaining more liquidity than you would expect as they began to weigh in on new credit facilities whether its capital markets or whether its bank balance sheets and the reason is because i think youre going to see leaders of businesses that were very unnerved with the great recession and then just a few years later got very unnerved with the covid experience the end result of that is going to be psychologically a very reserved view that argues for maintaining liquidity even as youre borrowing so i personally expect that youre going to see borrowing increase faster than most people expect as we head into the latter part of this year and still maintain liquidity truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp erika for consumer what were seeing right now is checking balances are about higher and savings balances are up obviously a lot of that is driven by stimulus but for lending to occur theres got to be demand and i think we are seeing spending now on nondiscretionary type things which i mean discretionary type of things excuse me and i think when cash depletes there will be more lending but it is tough today for home equity type products as a result of all the stimulus erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you all operator well take our next question from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning everyone just wanted to follow up on the fee income side i think embedded within your kind of flat revenues and flattish nii kind of flattish fees and chris had talked about the plus 3ishpercent outlook for insurance so just wanted to understand and given that there was a gain in there too this quarter just what are some of the other moving parts of fees as you look outward daryl you had sounded very optimistic at the beginning of the year about the outlook for fees im just wondering what you think continues to be the other positives and then some things that might be settling back out off of recent strength thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah ken from a fee perspective i think insurance as chris said will have its largest quarter of the year in the second quarter so that will be strong second quarter activity is usually strong in the payments area and activity so i think all those will be relatively strong i think were calling for tighter margins in the mortgage area so that even though well have higher volumes we might have lower revenues there potentially and then if you look into investment banking and trading areas we did have a cva adjustment this past quarter for that to continue wed have to have rates continue going up we dont really have a good prediction if rates are going to go up or not export or not so were just kind of saying thats relatively flat they do have strong pipelines though in the ma area and other pieces so netnet i think theyll still be strong but cva was a benefit for us this past quarter but i think overall ken we feel pretty good about fees and right now were staying relatively flat and well just see how the quarter unveils and hopefully we can beat that performance ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 got it great and secondly youve teased out before this potential to relook at that cet1 and obviously getting through the rest of the pandemic would probably be priority one but what are the other factors that you need to continue to evaluate that and could it be a big delta or are you talking about just modest changes as you continue to tighten up on what this company looks like over the long term thanks kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah so ken youve heard us say that the relationship between capital and risk is what drives our capital decisions going into the merger and up to the current moment weve judged that the risk externally were substantial we judged that the risk of making sure we do the merger right were material and so as we look forward what we see is that the risk externally are mitigating covid is mitigating economic risks are mitigating so assuming that its not some huge existential event that we dont anticipate the external factors are mitigating meaningfully internally as i described earlier the risks are reducing daily and so it does set forward the opportunity for us to have some capital actions that can be attractive to our shareholders its hard to judge right now the materiality of that because you literally have to take it a day at a time one thing we should have all learned is the projecting out in this kind of environment six months or nine months now is just not rational and so you have to kind of take it more carefully but as we do as we see risk began to continue to materially mitigate we do have meaningful opportunity in terms of capital deployment ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thank you kelly operator thank you well take our next question from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning a good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc on the margin front i know you guided to some incremental compression in the second quarter and then in the fourth quarter saw a bit greater pressure than expected i think how should we think about a bottoming of the margin when do you think that can materialize you expect that from the third quarter and maybe give us some thoughts around what could drive that thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah john so if you look at margin and ill start off with our core margin core margin was were guiding that to be down midsingle digits so i think well stay in the given what we know its really a truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 function this is like as hard as its ever been and trying to forecast actually a margin number out because of all this excess liquidity going on and whats happening with the loan portfolio and all that that said we expect to get more deposit growth as the stimulus plays out thats going to continue to put pressure on core margin no matter what we do with those funds right now until loan volume picks up were either going to put it at the fed or were going to invest the dollars so our core margin is coming down we believe that we can probably stay in the for most of this year hopefully and if as loans pick up in the second half of the year we might be in the higher range of but right now i will just say mid to lower and then if you just look at the gaap or reported margin we are running off a purchase accounting accretion its about or basis points a quarter is what its been doing the last couple of quarters that will continue so were at and you adjust for core coming down and then you take or basis points down that will come down probably end up in the give or take by the end of the year depending on what happens with the accretion runoff but that said and i think the important thing there is that we are focused on managing nii and were guiding for at least flat if not better than flat nii as the year plays out john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thanks daryl thats helpful and then separately on the loan growth front you mentioned a couple of times now the likely inflection in loan growth ideally in the back half of the year it seems like maybe if you could help us think about that the pace of growth that could materialize in the back half and more importantly what type of loan growth is fair to assume as we look going into talking about the lowsingledigit pace as being reasonable william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp yeah i think as kelly noted earlier i mean its hard to project out a lot of months here because there are a lot of binary events that are going on but we just look at things like pipelines we look at things like productions we look at things like the impacts of those so i do think if you look at overall and think about core and think about that base i mean were talking about singledigit kind of growth through the latter part of the year the things that could influence that more would be as i mentioned earlier revolver utilization changing things like that but i think when we look at sort of the core growth part i would think sort of averaging singledigits and then of course for us you just have to remember we have a little bit of that ppp headwind in the total loan growth but we really think about sort of core second half of the year some type of singledigit opportunity john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it thanks bill thats helpful operator thank you well take our final question from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 thanks good morning kelly and bill i wanted to follow up on your esg commentary in the release how have your discussions evolved with different stakeholders are the investments youre making in esg a source of differentiation or are they table stakes and how are you thinking about the financial impact of esg kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah so we feel very good about the longterm financial impacts of esg its clearly the right thing to do for our communities for the economy at large to be honest its bumpy right now for all of us to figure out what the near term economic impacts are because were all fairly new at this but theres no doubt that the longterm economic impacts will be very positive not to mention the quality of life and the future for our kids and our grandkids and so were really committed to a very aggressive and broadbased esg program youve just seen a lot of things we do and like our social bond daryl has done a lot of things already in terms of bringing our environment we have lots more plans as we go down the road so its something that we all in the corporate community need to be highly invested in truist is i think its net accretive long term in the short term it could be a little bumpy william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp yeah i think as kelly said i mean we view it collectively as an opportunity versus a requirement and i think thats how we want to think about it and i think our teammates have embraced that and i think there are things that will just make us a better company and a better society bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful thank you and if i may as a followup a separate question for daryl could you give some additional thoughts around the variability on either side of around the billion and billion of merger costs on slide with seven quarters to go through how do you think about the potential for these to come in either better or worse any perspective there would be great daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp bill i would tell you were on track of getting about billion last year we did about billion and if you add the two numbers together this year well probably be billion billion as well this year as the numbers come through and then well finish out and get the rest in so i think were just on track right now our main focus to be honest with you is to really do a great job on the convergence to make sure everybody has a really positive client experience that would be the best outcome of all and ph what the cost portion that we have in there should be able and enable that to happen bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thank you operator that will conclude our questionandanswer session id like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2021 alan greer investor
