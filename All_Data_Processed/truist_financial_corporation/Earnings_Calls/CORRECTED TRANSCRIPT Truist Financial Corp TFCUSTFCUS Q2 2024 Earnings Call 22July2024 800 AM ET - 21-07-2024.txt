joining our call today so before we discuss our second quarter results lets begin with purpose on slide as you all know truist is a purposedriven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities purpose is the foundation for things that we do we believe purpose and performance are inextricably linked id like to share some of the ways we brought our purpose to life last quarter during the quarter truist securities advised and served as an active joint book runner for oglethorpe powers inaugural million green bond which will be used to support their investment in plant vogtle the largest producer of clean energy in the united states the company is committed to reducing ghg emissions while delivering costeffective and reliable clean energy with a diverse energy portfolio this transaction represents only the second greenlabeled bond in the us where the use of proceeds are allocated to nuclear energy we also launched a new financial education program tailored specifically for high school and college students called truist life money and choices this initiative is aimed at empowering younger generations with financial lessons and essential skills to navigate their financial futures these are just a couple of examples of how we brought our purpose to life during the quarter im very proud of the meaningful work were doing across our businesses to have a positive impact on the lives of our clients our teammates our communities and of course our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose so lets turn to our key takeaways on slide on an adjusted basis we reported net income available to common shareholders of billion or per share which excludes the gain on the sale of truist insurance holdings the loss on the sale of certain availableforsale investment securities a charitable donation to the truist foundation and a few smaller items that mike will discuss in further detail in the call in addition pretax restructuring charges of million which were primarily related to the sale of tih and severance and also negatively impacted adjusted eps by per share so looking through a few discrete items in the quarter were pleased with our underlying results as you can see on the slide our solid performance was defined by several key themes first we grew adjusted revenue on a linked quarter basis which was driven by growth in net interest income due primarily to the balance sheet reposition we completed during the quarter second our results show our continued expense discipline and focus on managing cost as a result of these efforts adjusted expenses increased by linked quarter and decreased by on a yearoveryear basis we are fully committed to delivering our objective of keeping expenses flat in versus last year were also pleased that nonperforming loans remained relatively stable for the fifth consecutive quarter and that net chargeoffs were within our expectations during the quarter we also completed the sale of our remaining stake in truist insurance holdings which significantly strengthened our relative capital position and creates substantial capacity for growth in our core banking businesses in recognition of the incredibly longterm positive impact of our insurance business we utilized a portion of the gain to make a million charitable contribution to the truist foundation to further our purposedriven work across our banking footprint for years to come simultaneously with the closing of tih we repositioned a portion of our availableforsale investment portfolio which along with the proceeds received from the sale of tih is expected to provide an offset to tihs earnings contribution mike will provide more details on these transactions later in the call in late june our board authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock through the end of we plan to begin repurchasing our shares during the third quarter and will initially target share repurchases of approximately million per quarter for the remainder of the year finally we continue to actively pursue growth opportunities in our core consumer and wholesale banking businesses although overall loan demand remained slow during the quarter im encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of increased wallet share truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 within certain businesses and the talent were attracting to our company which im going to discuss a little later in the call so before i hand the call over to mike to discuss the financial performance in more detail let me provide a quick update on the progress were making in improving experiences for our clients on slide we continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities as client mobile app users grew and that digital transactions increased compared to the second quarter of last year transactions continue to shift towards selfservice capabilities primarily driven by strong growth in zelle transactions which are up year overyear in addition we added over new accounts during the quarter including nearly newto bank clients through our digital channels which represents a increase over the second quarter importantly digital checking account production among gen z and millennial clients is higher by on a year overyear basis a new more modernized small business digital onboarding experience has also resulted in a new high in application completion rates while were also seeing increased digital engagement with our small business clients weve also made enhancements to enterprise platforms that have empowered teammates to deliver knowledge and care through million caring conversations resulting in million accepted recommendations for great truist products and services these enhanced offerings coupled with strong growth in digital have resulted in higher consumer digital client satisfaction scores as we continue to focus on accelerated adoption and efficiency using our t3 strategy overall im really proud of the continued momentum truist is making in digital engagement so with that let me turn it over to mike to discuss the financial results in more detail mike michael b maguire chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you bill and good morning everyone before i begin discussing our second quarter results id like to spend a few moments recapping the strategic actions that significantly impacted our second quarter results first on may we completed the divestiture of our remaining ownership stake in truist insurance holdings at an implied value of billion at closing we received aftertax cash proceeds of approximately billion and recorded an aftertax gain of billion the sale of tih created billion of capital which generated basis points of cet1 under current capital rules and basis points of capital under proposed fully phased in basel iii rules our tangible book value per share also increased by on the same day we executed a strategic balance sheet repositioning of a portion of our availableforsale investment securities portfolio we sold approximately billion of market value loweryielding investment securities which resulted in an aftertax loss of billion the investment securities that we sold had a book value of billion and a weighted average book yield of for the remainder of including the impact of hedges and based on the federal funds curve at that time including the tax benefit the sale of investment securities generated billion of proceeds available for reinvestment when coupled with the proceeds from the sale of tih there were billion of proceeds available for reinvestment of that we invested approximately billion in investment securities yielding with the remaining billion held in cash at the time we invested the proceeds the blended reinvestment rate on the new investment securities purchased and the cash was for the remainder of including the impact of hedges as bill mentioned the reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale of tih and the balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter are expected to replace tihs earnings contributions truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 these actions completed during the second quarter significantly accelerate our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry and importantly create capacity for truist to grow its core banking franchise and to return capital to shareholders via our strong dividend and share repurchases now turning to our second quarter key performance highlights on slide we reported second quarter gaap net income available to common shareholders of million or per share this included a net loss of billion from continuing operations or per share and net income from discontinued operations of billion or per share the net loss available to common shareholders from continuing operations of billion or per share was impacted by the following items a billion pretax or per share after tax loss on the sale of certain available for sale investment securities million pretax or per share charitable contribution to the truist foundation a million pretax or per share after tax expense related to fdic special assessment adjustment net income available to common shareholders from discontinued operations of billion or per share was impacted by the following items a billion pretax or per share after tax gain on the sale of truist insurance holdings a million pretax or per share after tax expense due to the accelerated recognition of tih equitybased compensation so on an adjusted basis we reported net income available to common shareholders of billion or per share in addition to the items i just noted we also had pretax restructuring charges totaling million in the quarter which negatively impacted adjusted eps to common shareholders by per share approximately million of these pretax charges or per share after tax negatively impacted net income from continuing operations and were primarily related to severance and real estate rationalization the remaining restructuring charges were recorded in discontinued operations and were related to legal and other expenses associated with closing the divestiture of tih total revenue adjusted for the losses on the available for sale investment securities increased linked quarter due to a increase in net interest income and relatively stable noninterest income adjusted expenses increased linked quarter but were down approximately on a like quarter basis our cet1 ratio increased by basis points linked quarter to primarily reflecting the sale of tih and the balance sheet repositioning i discussed earlier in addition net chargeoffs declined basis points on a linked quarter basis and our nonperforming loans remained relatively stable both on a like and linked quarter basis moving to slide average loans decreased on a sequential basis reflecting overall weaker client demand collecting average commercial loans decreased billion or primarily due to a decline in ci balances driven at least in part by capital markets activity in our consumer portfolio average loans decreased billion or due to runoff in our residential mortgage portfolio and a decline in indirect auto other consumer balances which include our specialty lending units experienced modest growth and benefited from seasonal strength at sheffield and increased demand at service finance overall we expect client loan demand to remain relatively muted in the third quarter moving to deposit trends on slide average deposits decreased sequentially as growth in money market and savings was offset by declines in noninterest bearing time and broker balances average noninterest bearing deposits decreased and represented of total deposits which is unchanged compared to during the first quarter of during the quarter we experienced an increase in deposit costs albeit at a slower pace than the first quarter specifically total deposit costs increased six basis points sequentially which resulted in a increase in our cumulative total deposit beta to interest bearing deposit costs increased seven basis points sequentially to which also resulted in a increase to our cumulative total interestbearing deposit beta cost of moving to net interest income and net interest margin on slide for the quarter taxable equivalent net interest income increased linked quarter or million primarily due to the strategic balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 excluding the impact of this repositioning our net interest income would have been relatively stable on a linked quarter basis due primarily to our focus on average client deposits which declined less than we expected reported net interest margin increased basis points on a linked quarter basis to this was due primarily to the impact of the balance sheet repositioning the partial quarter impact of the balance sheet repositioning helped drive a 31basis point improvement in the average yield on our investment securities portfolio to we estimate that our balance sheet remains positioned as relatively neutral from an interest rate perspective comparable to  turning to noninterest income on slide adjusted noninterest income which excludes the losses associated with the balance sheet repositioning decreased million or relative to the first quarter the linked quarter decrease was primarily attributable to lower investment banking and trading income which declined million from our strong first quarter performance due to lower ma fees equity originations and trading income partially offset by higher loan syndication fees this decline was partially offset by higher mortgage banking and other income adjusted noninterest income increased on a like quarter basis as higher investment banking and trading and wealth management income were partially offset by lower service charge on deposit and other income on a yeartodate basis investment banking and trading income is up nearly over the same period in now ill cover noninterest expense on slide gaap expenses of billion increased million linked quarter primarily due to higher other expense related to million charitable donation higher personnel costs reflecting merit increases and higher professional fees these increases were offset by lower restructuring charges and a reduction in fdic expense due to a larger special assessment recorded in the first quarter excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization adjusted noninterest expense increased sequentially due to higher personnel expense and professional fees on a like quarter basis adjusted expenses declined to million or reflecting lower head count in our continued expense discipline moving to asset quality on slide asset quality remained stable on both a like and linked quarter basis reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving problem loans during the quarter our net chargeoff ratio decreased basis points to basis points the decrease in net chargeoffs for the quarter reflects lower consumer losses due to normal second quarter seasonal declines and certain derisking initiatives put in place in the second half of our loan loss provision declined to million linked quarter reflecting our stable credit performance but it still exceeded net chargeoffs for the quarter resulting in a slight build to our overall loan loss allowance our alll ratio increased to up one basis point sequentially and basis points yearoveryear which reflects ongoing credit normalization and stress in the office sector despite the normalization nonperforming loans remained relatively stable for the fifth consecutive quarter while total delinquencies increased just basis points on a linked quarter basis wholesale criticized loans declined a billion linked quarter to billion included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio which is virtually unchanged at of total loans however we did increase our reserve on this portfolio from to during the quarter to reflect continued stress in the sector approximately of our office portfolio is currently classified as nonperforming compared with at march approximately of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan notably approximately of our office portfolio is housed within our community banking and wealth segments where loan sizes tend to be more granular guarantor support more prevalent and overall loss is lower we expect stress to remain in the office sector and believe that the size of our portfolio is manageable and wellreserved but our position is to be very proactive in identifying and resolving issues in this portfolio pointing out of capital on slide truists cet1 ratio increased from at march to at june the increase was driven by truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 the gain on the sale of truist insurance holdings and organic capital generation which was partially offset by the loss on the sale of certain available for sale investment securities during the quarter which i addressed earlier importantly the sale of tih creates capacity for truist to pursue growth opportunities in our consumer and wholesale banking businesses and to return significant capital to shareholders as evidenced by our share buyback program truist is wellpositioned to weather a wide variety of economic scenarios which was evident in our most recent ccar stress test results released in late june specifically truist had the second lowest ci loan loss rate and the third lowest cet1 erosion rate versus our peers our stress capital buffer will improve by basis points to effective october 1st at june our cet1 ratio was basis points higher than our new regulatory minimum of leaving us well positioned to both grow our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders our increased level of capital accelerates our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry as our estimated cet1 capital ratio under proposed basel iii endgame rules improved basis points to at june which is basis points above our new regulatory minimum and now ill review updated guidance on slide looking into the third quarter of we expect revenue to increase to from second quarter adjusted revenue of billion we expect net interest income to increase to in the third quarter primarily driven by a full quarter impact of the balance sheet repositioning completed on may 6th we expect noninterest income to remain relatively stable on a linked quarter basis adjusted expenses of billion in the second quarter are expected to increase by in the third quarter due to higher professional fees software costs and higher marketing costs for the full year we previously expected revenues to be down to we now expect total revenues to decline by approximately to in our updated outlook is based on slightly better client deposit balance performance partially offset by lower client loan demand and our updated view of interest rates which now assumes just one reduction in the federal funds rate in november of this year consistent with our previous expense outlook we expect full year adjusted expenses to remain approximately flat over adjusted expenses of billion in terms of asset quality we continue to expect net chargeoffs of about basis points in as bill previously mentioned we are targeting approximately million of share repurchases per quarter for the remainder of the year as part of our share repurchase authorization announced in late june finally we expect our effective tax rate to approximate or on a taxable equivalent basis in both the third and fourth quarters of now ill hand it back to bill for some final remarks william henry rogers chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp great thanks mike so our top priorities for are unchanged they include growing and deepening relationships with core clients maintaining our expense discipline returning capital to our shareholders via share buybacks and our common strong dividend and enhancing our digital experience through t3 all while maintaining and strengthening strong risk controls and asset quality metrics we made demonstrable progress on these priorities during the quarter and im really proud of the results our teammates delivered which included solid underlying earnings improved momentum and sound asset quality all this was accomplished while also completing the divestiture of truist insurance holdings and repositioning our balance sheet during the quarter these actions created significant capital capacity to grow our consumer and wholesale businesses and return capital to shareholders via our strong common dividend and our recently announced repurchase authorization of up to billion of our common stock in addition our significantly stronger balance sheet is wellpositioned to weather an even wider range of economic and interest rate environments although the balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter is truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 expected to replace tihs earnings in the nearterm we recognize that our increased level of capital will result in nearterm dilution to our return on average tangible common equity ratio as ive said previously our starting point for our roatce is exactly that its a starting point were going to move with pace to deploy our capital improve our returns but were not going to be in a rush to leverage capital to meet shortterm expectations that do not have longterm positive impact on our company clients and shareholders we have a clear understanding of not only where we want to win but where we want to win profitably well look to share more of our plan with you as we progress through the remainder of this year i can say that im encouraged that much of the profitability improvement potential we are working towards is centered on further deepening of existing client relationships in verticals and product lines that already exist at truist we have great confidence in our ability to further penetrate our existing client base grow our core banking business and help new and existing clients achieve financial success by delivering our commercial consumer payments investment banking and wealth platform given the ongoing investment through our existing footprint and specialty areas in wholesale weve invested in our investment banking and trading platform over the last several years weve also hired experienced bankers in key industry verticals and products these investments have resulted in greater mind share with our clients across many industry verticals and an increase in the number of lead roles across several product lines most recently weve invested heavily in our payments business and have made key leadership additions as this is an area where we see significant opportunity for growth over time not only with new clients but also within our existing client base we have a clear focus high expectations and a compelling teammate value proposition many of our teammates have risen to this new challenge and we have very successfully hired additional strong talent in wholesale primarily from larger institutions who have experience and are thriving in our purposedriven highperformance culture we plan to continue adding talent in wholesale with a specific focus on further building out our middle market commercial lending segment which represents one of the largest growth opportunities within our regional business we will primarily focus on industries that support existing corporate investment banking coverage and expertise were making these investments while also adhering to our expense discipline which is helping fund investments in technology to improve the client experience and also to improve risk management in consumer im really encouraged with our momentum our internal client satisfaction scores continue to improve as evidenced by increased netnew checking account production increased primacy and lower attrition rates netnew checking account production was once again positive in the second quarter as we added new consumer and business accounts importantly were also seeing yearoveryear improvement in account attrition rates and increased primacy and usage within new account openings as i previously mentioned we added new accounts during the quarter including nearly newtobank clients through our digital channels which represented a increase in addition to an increase in account openings were also seeing improvement in the funding of our digital account openings with balances up over the second quarter of last year in consumer and small business lending weve been consistently adding new small business lenders across our footprint in the second quarter small business applications increased linked quarter resulting in a increase in our pipeline giving us confidence that average consumer balance ph since excluding runoff and residential mortgages will stabilize in the third quarter in conclusion im pleased with the progress weve made as a company at the midpoint of this year but we acknowledge theres more work to do as we strive to produce better results in the future we have tremendous momentum within our company we have momentum with our clients and weve got great momentum with our teammates truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 we have an incredible franchise energized purposeful teammates and specialized capabilities that our clients value we think the ability to grow our core banking business our profitability and return significant amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next several years is a unique differentiating factor for truist i am optimistic about our future i look forward to operating our company from our increased position of financial strength and finally id be remiss if i didnt thank all of our incredible teammates and our great leaders for their incredible purposeful focus on productivity and moving our company forward so brad with that let me hand it over back over to you for qa brad milsaps headinvestor relations truist financial corp thank you bill betsy at this time will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session as you do that id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one followup in order that we may accommodate as many of you as possible today question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question today comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning bill good morning mike william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc maybe to start off with nii it feels close to restructuring weve bottomed now and you should get a stepup next quarter but can you maybe just talk about the drivers of sequential nii growth over the next few quarters do you expect margin improvement and then how do you think about where the margin could be heading over the medium term thanks and i have a followup michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp good morning ryan weve mentioned in our comments that we do expect the nii to improve next quarter by to really the bulk of that is driven by just the full quarter impact of the repositioning that we completed back in may we continue to expect there to be some pressure on client deposit balances as well as loan balances so maybe a touch conservative there we did have some nice just to say it just some nice outperformance in the second quarter on client deposit balances which really helped stabilize that core nii ex the bonds but thats really sort of the story for  and i think  just looking out a little further as you think about kind of rest a year trajectory kind of more of the same right i mean we mentioned weve got a november cut in we think that truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 helps a touch but that is the first cut and its pretty late so weve got pretty modest expectations around the impact there and i think for us really what will stimulate some improvement on the nii side will just be some of the core balances so getting client loan demand increased which hopefully will generate balances as well and ill just mention this i mean were very focused around the company pick your segment or lob everybody in the company is very focused on realizing that growth opportunity once it presents itself and youve heard this from i think others this week and last week there just has really not been a lot of client activity ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it maybe this one for mike or bill as a followup to mikes comments so it looks like loan balances are getting closer to level off but mike you highlighted youre expecting it to be muted and my interpretation was that it doesnt sound like youre expecting a lot of growth in the fourth quarter so maybe just flush those expectations a little further bill when do you expect it to turn positive what do you think the drivers are and i guess given the strength of your footprint do you actually expect truist to begin to outperform peers on growth at some point thank you william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp ill start with the second part of that first and the answer to that is yes but it has to have growth weve got to sort of see that coming clients are on the sidelines i mean we can feel that in our conversations our conversations are increasingly a lot more strategic so i feel like we actually even know more about what our clients are thinking but theyre a bit on the sidelines our production was up so we saw production being up it was really probably best in consumer where it was up a little more significantly utilization is just absolutely flat but paydowns were also up and our clients that arent towards the larger side they were accessing the capital markets and the good news is i mean you see that in our investment banking particularly in our dcm results our capture rate on that is really really high so we sort of see the other part of that despite the pipelines being up production being up i just want to be careful ryan about sort of like putting a stake in the ground and saying okay its going to return on x i mean take this weekend i mean theres a lot of uncertainty out there in the world and in the market so while clients have capacity were coil spring ready to go positioned better than anybody i think we just want to be realistic about when and if that well not if but when thats going to come back and when its come back and come back with some strength and when it does i think to your latter part of your question were in the best markets and i think we should disproportionately grow faster ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for all the color bill william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yep operator the next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks i guess as a followup to that line of thought bill you mentioned that youd be methodical and kind of not getting ahead of yourself to just use near terms im just wondering if you can kind of just remind us again now that weve got the buyback out there now that restructuring is done just gave me more color on the loan growth talk about prioritization what would lead you to do kind of one more than the other in terms of moving the ball of all things excess capital related and then how that kind of leads into your pacing choices on the buyback specifically thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah ken great question and obviously something thats important that were going to be calibrating priority one two and three is growing our business i mean we think weve got a great franchise a great market were really well positioned weve invested in talent weve invested in capabilities so i think weve got the capacity and the capability to grow in our core business so that is absolutely going to be the primary focus we raised capital in the most efficient way possible you just couldnt have raised it more efficiently than how we raised capital and we want to make sure that we deploy that also in the most efficient way possible longterm benefit for our shareholders so i think weve put together a compelling return perspective with what mike outlined were going to do about million a quarter for the next couple of quarters i would presume wed enter next year in sort of the same kind of pace but remember thats also on top of weve got a really strong dividend so in terms of total dollars returned to shareholders over the next six months i mean we have a really compelling value proposition so were going to calibrate that as we go along we dont want to overindex on one and lose this incredible capital advantage we have for growth ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and then secondly as you enjoy this incremental nii benefit it does seem like in the second half certainly in the third quarter expenses look to be increasing can you give us also a little bit of context in terms of how youre calibrating the new better revenue outlook to making those investments and the pacing just flattish flat is a tough like overall guide to see through but kind of at flat it implies that third quarter and fourth quarter expenses are still are going higher just wondering if you could provide a little context underneath that about your pacing of your investment spending and to the areas you mentioned earlier thanks michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp hey ken its mike maybe take a swing at that one no youre right i mean look we think we do see growth in the third quarter on the expense side i think thats still on a like basis close to flat maybe even a touch better and i think that implies if you think about flat maybe a touch of growth in the fourth as well look i mean the first half of the year we were very focused on cost discipline and frankly following through on our commitment around flat thats still important to us but as weve sort of gotten to the midway mark there have been certain projects whether it be some marketing spend sort of you name it ph nits and nats that perhaps were delayed and that drove some of the beat maybe even this quarter and even in last quarter and so some of that stuff just makes a ton of sense and as we really shift our mindset and you heard bill talk a little bit about it in his prepared remarks around some of the hiring were doing in middle market lending as an example around our payments business some truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 calibrating of marketing spend etc these are all factors that are driving our outlook for the second half and so what we feel and we said that is really since last fall we are very very confident committed to being sort of or better on expenses this year william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and ken just add to that i mean when we undertook this approach in the fall of last year but we were always really clear thats going to include investments and the timing of those sort of as mike pointed out come quarter toquarter and were seeing the benefit of that i mean investments were made in payments investment made in talents so the expense guidance was always coincident with that ill just say it because i think its really important the discipline that we have in the company around both of those is significantly increased so we sort of know the next dollar invest with a lot of confidence and we also have just incredibly strong discipline around the expense side and where the opportunities are so i think weve got the right balance here and as mike said wholly committed to a flatter better expense proposition for the remainder of this year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thank you guys operator the next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning everyone thanks for taking the question mike i know you suggested you all are relatively neutral to rate moves and i think still kind of for better or worse a lot of investors consider truist among the kind of closer to the liabilitysensitive side of the equation in that vein you anticipate just one rate cut in the remainder of the year how would another one or two affect that nii guidance obviously timing would be a factor but just curious on your overall thoughts michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yes good morning scott yes so we do have the one cut in november if we got one earlier call i think the curve today has a september cut and maybe december and maybe even a touch more than that that would be a help for us look we our baseline path does show benefit from down rates i think the question that i brought it up in sort of my earlier question that ryan asked that first cut given how high we are and how late we expect it were just trying to be reasonable in thinking about the benefit well get there but i think youre right i think if we got one earlier and then may be perhaps a second that would be a good guy i will say this i think just given where we are in terms of how high we are and how long weve been here and some of the client behavior that were able to observe i think the more impactful catalyst will be again getting some of that loan demand and balance growth and client deposit growth as well so wed take it all r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you and then maybe switching gears just a second something you might be able to address the investment banking line down a little in the quarter but id say youre at least as i see it youre still well above a recent run rate so its still a very strong number maybe if you could touch to or speak to sort of truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 overall thoughts on the outlook and then maybe a thought on what you might consider sort of a sustainable base of revenues for you all william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean were the investment banking business is always going to be a little quartertoquarter variation in the first quarter we had one of the highest ma fees in our companys history so that sort of change impacted that a bit but most importantly i feel really good about the momentum so if you look at sort of our relevance i mean were gaining share in virtually every category the things that were doing in terms of active bookrunner and leftlead transactions and dcm half of our fees were being from active bookrunner dramatic change from where weve been in the past lots of leftleads transactions in there and again increased market share and most importantly just really good relevance so back to sort of the comment about talent and comment about adding talent and upgrading our toolkits our commercial bankers focus and understanding and of our capabilities is just increasing exponentially so our dialogue as i mentioned with our clients is really strong its all strategic dialogue versus product dialogue which is really good and i think for the balance of the year i mean i think this is the kind of momentum we ought to be able to continue in investment banking so i think we feel good about that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right bill and mike thank you guys very much operator the next question comes from erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc just putting everything that youve said together mike maybe ill address this one to you your net interest income was better than consensus both mostly on the net interest margin you mentioned that the impact of the margin from balance sheet restructuring is a partial one if i look at the line items on noninterest income you also beat consensus there for the quarter in terms of the core items and consensus is at down one which is at the low end of your revenue range i guess like what are we missing and i heard your response to ryans question about you expect balances to continue to come down on both loan on deposit side but if your starting point on net interest margin is higher than consensus and then you have a little bit more pull through a months pull through in the third quarter and youre neutral to rates and september will help i guess are you being very conservative on what you could accomplish in the second half of the year truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 because i get the conservatism from a business standpoint but from a rate standpoint it feels like you guys are in good shape to maybe do a little bit better michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah erika i appreciate the question i mean i think there was a beat on balances in the second quarter especially if you look at it on an average basis and so our rate paid was a touch better than we thought and so youre right starting position better than where we would have expected to be in april i think the pressures that we expected in the second quarter we still believe will persist in the third especially in terms of balances and rate paid another piece of this is that while we did get some benefit on our net interest margin from the bonds like re couponing some of the benefit as well is just on a smaller balance sheet so we did for example we paid down some wholesale liabilities late in the second that will come through in the third on an average basis so youll see more net interest margin improvement but itll be on a more efficient smaller balance sheet on rates i dont want to call the ball on conservative nonconservative i think were cautious on what benefit well get on the first cut or two weve thought about it a lot done a lot of work and analysis you look at sort of historically over the last call it years the down cycles and the betas have been slow right so i think thats in our thinking too for the rest of the year and look ive said this a couple of times i think for us the thing were like feel fine about the guidance we gave i think what would really be upside for us would be a little bit of pull through on more client activity and the ability to generate more loan volume and with that will come deposits you get that and maybe you get scotts extra cut in early and that feels good i mean the hurts are obviously the cut weve got no cuts perhaps maybe thats not such a bad guy and then just the pressure that weve been seeing on balances both deposits and loans erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc i got it and my second question is for bill on capital and returns and maybe im just reading too much into tea leaves because investors are very curious the authorization for the billion is through you said during your prepared remarks and tell me if im being too tickytacky but you said initially target billion for the remainder of the year and i guess investors are wondering about timing and i know someone had already asked ken had already asked about capital priorities but whats the timing in terms of fulfilling that billion authority and as i think about returns i know youll probably tell us more during fall conference season but initially this franchise together with tih had an rotce potential in the low with tih out could you still achieve like a high teens rotce and im sure you will get more details during fall conference season william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah erika just to correct one thing we said ph sort of a billion through the remainder of this year and well sort of start the next year and the reason to put the authorization of up to and make it through is just to give us that kind of flexibility in terms of how we think about that so were going to calibrate that against our growth opportunities and where we see an ability to invest in our franchise and were going to be disciplined about it so and then as i mentioned earlier remember this is with a really strong dividend as well so i think you cant talk about one without talking about the other in terms of total return to shareholders so i think our unique capability to have a really good return to shareholders over the certainly nearterm and mediumterm from the dividend buyback is actually quite significant and then you put on top of that our ability to earn and earn profitably and grow our business truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 so i think thats were trying to look at all of this in the big mix as it relates to rotce specifically yeah i mean the past numbers are the past numbers we sort of have to start from the business model that we have now again were going to give a little more guidance on that with a little more specificity as we get towards the end of the year as you mentioned i think well have a little more knowledge as to sort of overall capital requirements and while basel may not be complete i think we might have a better picture of where we might be and what the sort of cet1 base might be that wed operate from and think about how to put all those mixes together as it relates to growth as well so irrespective of the target itself the growth to the target i think is a really compelling proposition for truist erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you operator the next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp morning michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc a bit of a followup on last question with erika regarding capital i put together the million that youre looking for in the buybacks and the dividend it looks like youre for the most part returning earnings quarterly earnings to investors at least for the rest of this year and rwa doesnt change that means youve got the cet1 stable where it is today i know youre probably not you didnt put a target cet1 out im going to guess youre going to highlight that we need the capital rules to put that out there but is that a fair conclusion that is essentially what we should anticipate as we roll through the rest of this year michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah betsy i think thats roughed out you could see us sort of sliding sideways for a while for the reasons you mentioned youre right i mean you take the million buyback and call it million or so dividend youre approximately at this is rough earnings right and youre right we dont expect significant roa improvement or decline over the period ill just say this i mean and you mentioned sort of cet1 target bill referred to it as well i think a couple things just to think about there one we like operating with a higher level of capital in todays world one affords us the right we think strength and resiliency and ability to sort of react to the world importantly weve got a growth agenda were focused on prosecuting thats companywide you feel that with truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 any especially frontline but really across the whole company and then bill mentioned sort of the capability to return capital and that can come in various forms but yeah i think modeling us somewhat flat shortterm but again we our expectation is that well begin to grow rwas next year and so thats how were thinking about it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right and then on the paydowns that you experienced in the ci book how much of that did you capture in the capital markets business in other words if folks are terming out and paying down ci is that are we seeing a majority recaptured in the fee line thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah its hard to do that calculation sort of perfectly and we spend a lot of time thinking about it but if you sort of look at the overall line this was one of our best dcm quarters in a really long time so our capture rate is really high its hard to put an exact percentage on that because there are puts and takes and would you have gotten it otherwise and was it related to this side or the other but its really high and its reflected in our overall dcm growth betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thanks so much appreciate it william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah operator the next question comes from john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning indiscernible just touch on credit a little bit i know you added modestly to the loan loss reserve and it looks like much of that was on the office side wanted to get your thoughts there in terms of what youre seeing right now in terms of credit progression what are the areas that youre seeing some weakening you had some pressure on delinquencies and nonaccruals and could that justify incremental modest additions to the reserve from here or could you see it stable or even some releases from this point thanks clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp hey john this is clarke as mike and bill said we were very pleased with the overall asset quality for the quarter and we generally had stable delinquencies we had flat npls and our losses were a touch lower particularly in this consumer area so were still seeing the consumer side the normalization thats occurring due to higher rates inflation and the stimulus burn down particularly for the lowerend consumer so weve been a little careful there even in this quarters reserve we added a little bit for those lowerincome consumer finance truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 areas and then youre right on the cre side and the office exposure we still just want to make sure were addressing the uncertainty there on the wholesale ci side we actually had as bill said lower watch list and even though were monitoring areas like the leverage book consumer discretionary senior care transportation some of those more ratesensitive areas weve not had any big sector issues today thats been more episodic so when we think about our reserves we feel really good about the adequacy where we are today and it reflects what we know today so unless theres a substantial change in the economic outlook or that level of uncertainty in areas of stress like cre office would emerge higher we would expect our reserve levels for the remainder of to be relatively stable john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks for that clarke and then separately on the fee side just i know you mentioned relatively stable in terms of the noninterest income outlook for the third quarter maybe can you talk about fourth quarter a little bit how we should think about the progression into fourth quarter and into and then separately as part of that on the investment banking side you made some pretty solid talent acquisition and you cited the intent that youre investing there and the progress youve made can you maybe just talk to us about is the buildout ongoing is there a focused effort to upscale the investment banking business even more in terms of the reach and breadth of the business and maybe whats the longterm revenue contribution from that business that you anticipate william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp maybe ill start with the latter mike and then ill turn it over to you indiscernible if thats okay so the buildout of the investment banking business has been decadesplus so this isnt sort of a new thing and sort of it has been consistent i think the way you described it is exactly right well continue to build where we have relevance where we have opportunity and so we can be competitive and win in our markets i think the part that gets missed that was investment were making around the investment banking business so this is the investment that were making with our commercial teams and our middle market teams and expanding their knowledge and capability to talk to clients about the things that are available to them and so think about the amount of clients in our commercial business that are now private equity owned and our capability to be relevant in those discussions and help them along that flight path so investments not just in the business itself but its in everything that surrounds the business and in support of we like the pace that were growing and i think weve had a really good cagr if you sort of go back over time and look at the cagr of that business youd sort of say thats a really good growth pattern importantly were doing it profitably which is also important so we have a really good efficiency of that business certainly on a relative basis and we want to keep all of those in check i mean we dont want to grow faster than the market we want to grow coincident with the opportunity that we have within our markets we want to do it profitably and we want to do it sustainably so we want to have a little less variability relative to that business so its tied to more of our core client capability than the vagaries of a particular market mike there was a michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah john i think you asked about truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp trajectory for the second half for fees i think some you dont know until you know put some puts and some takes our outlook is relatively stable really for the second half so call it stablestable william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and the upside to that is john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thank you william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah maybe upside to business is better were trying to take an approach with what we know right now john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thank you william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yep operator the next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey not a new question but it goes back to your efficiency ratio and your expense guide and you mentioned higher in the third quarter and maybe any preview for next year or how youre thinking about that and thats partly in the context theres a bloomberg story out saying that of the large banks fall short on operational risk according to the occ now thats not confirmed by the occ theres no specific companies given i know youre not allowed to say what your regulatory ratings are but if you or any other bank did have a deficient operational risk rating what would that mean would it mean i dont know what would that mean are you able to say if you had ever been in that position in the past five years i know you had some operational issues that you worked through and i also know bill that your purpose is being open every day for your clients and employees and your community so i know you put that as a very high priority so what degree has that hurt the efficiency in the past few years and to what degree could that still be a drag on efficiency going ahead thanks truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah mike you asked and answered part of your question as it relates to what well comment on and not comment on but look ive said very consistently actually since the day truist was formed the size and complexity of our organization were going to invest in our risk framework were going to invest in a durable risk framework so we can stay competitive we can stay appropriate with our regulators and thats always been part of this expense profile so i think even in todays prepared remarks i mean im always consistent with that and i think everybodys got to stay in that mode post of march of last year irrespective of anybodys ratings there was just an increased focus on creating a durable risk profile so were going to continue to be in that mode i cant see that changing shortterm mediumterm or longterm are there peaks and valleys in that as you go up yes does it increase proportionally absolutely i mean i just think thats the price of being in our business and also the importance of creating a durable sustainable risk framework for a company of our size and a company of our opportunity mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well the billion market cap question relates to the last part of your answer is for a company of our size so im just wondering and its an ongoing wonder to what degree does that investment in the risk framework hurt truist disproportionately versus banks larger than your size and how has that changed william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean there are efficient frontiers is the way mike that i like to talk about it therere efficient frontiers and where you are on the efficient frontier relative to that today i feel like were at a good place so were at a good place in terms of the investments that we need and should make relative to our company our size and our ability to return and have an efficient company relative to that so i think were at a good place but that efficient frontier moves so you always have to be flexible and think about that in the context of where it moves and were conscious of that so today i feel like were at a good place by the way we merged our companies because we thought we were at a different place and that that was going to be more complex and we needed to have a company of the size and scale sort of seen i mean we didnt project march of last year in fairness but understanding that the complexity and the durability and the investments needed to create that kind of risk platform was going to be needed so that efficient frontier i think were at a good place on it but it does move mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and last short follow up the definition of good place as it relates to i know you usually dont give guidance for a few quarters from now but other banks have mentioned record nii positive operating leverage lower expenses next year can you give us a sneak peek of good place as it relates to financials william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean our sneak peek is the momentum were creating right now so thats the sneak peek and we want to continue to do that mike you and i have talked about this i mean we have a strong focus on positive operating leverage so all of our businesses have plans that are focused on positive operating leverage thats truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 what they try to build over time the controllable more controllable factor over that is on the expense side right now and im really pleased with the progress were making and expect to continue to have that kind of discipline going forward those expenses will better reflect the revenue opportunity that we see in next year so be assured that weve got to focus on creating that but also be confident that were building momentum and i think this order is good evidence of that and our guidance for the rest of the year is good evidence of that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just a quick follow up bill on your response to mikes question as we think about i just want to make sure we understand this correctly as we think about next year ex any sort of revenue momentum taking sort of the top line higher should we expect expenses like the streets expecting about billion to billion per quarter in expense on rate continuing in is that fair to assume all else equal absent sort of revenue growth william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah thanks im not going to give expense guidance for next year just to say confidence that well be focused on positive operating leverage confidence that weve got great expense discipline and expenses will more parallel the revenue opportunity so if we see the investments that were making better growth opportunities in our markets were going to take advantage of that and if that requires a requisite expense increase then well do that but thatll all be in the appropriate context of focus on positive operating leverage and efficient company that has high returns ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc noted and just one quick followup maybe if you could remind us post sort of the acquisition integration where we stand in terms of any big tech upgrades coming on the deposit and lending platforms as we think about the next year or two thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean all thats been factored into the discussions that we have i mean our ability this year particularly to invest a lot in the payment side is all predicated on the existing platforms that we have the advent of the use truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 of apis have been really really great opportunities to continue to invest we had huge investments in our lending portfolios as part of the merger so theres no like one big stair step sequenced investment these are continuous investments in our platform and capabilities over time ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and is it safe to assume that from a tech platform standpoint truist is not at a disadvantage relative to peers who probably have not done deals and just been working on theres an impression out there that you have a lot more sort of heavy lifting to do there thats put you back sounds like thats not the case but just wanted to confirm william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp well the momentum weve seen in the last several quarters the impression from our clients is that we have a really good platform so our acquisition of clients our performance metrics client satisfaction scores all the things that we look in terms of how do clients think about us is real positive and continuing ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc excellent thank you bill operator we will take our last question today from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning thanks for squeezing in you kind of implied the loans and deposit balances might be down a little bit again in if i heard that correctly and they were down a little bit in here just thoughts on where they bottom and i understand like when were looking at industry data where theres less than loan growth like were talking about really small numbers but it seems like youre still kind of lagging the h8 data a little bit and its understandable given how much has been going on the company and we talked about spending more in marketing and hiring people but just thoughts on kind of where those level out and you start tracking the h8 data a little bit more thanks michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp hey matt thanks for the question maybe just taking loans first were hopeful well see some relief we were down a little less than a percent this quarter average in the third quarter i think again base case probably expected to be down maybe not quite as much wed love to see that be different but thats sort of what were thinking about and then hopefully kind of stable from there same on deposits actually deposits a little lower perhaps in the third we mentioned that we felt like we had some outperformance in the second quarter we did late in the quarter just like a lot of others some of the just sort of seasonality in tax payments we saw balance was a little lower at the end of the quarter thats not unusual so well probably expect a little bit of pressure in the third quarter as well but again even thats stabilizing in the fourth so think down a touch in the third for both and then hopefully stable in the fourthish matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2024 okay thats helpful and then just as you think about call it restarting kind of the loan deposit engine internally you did allude to the marketing and hiring people but whats like the process of just getting the message out to kind of existing employees like you got all this capital you got all this liquidity like you could be frontfooted and i know it takes time to kind of flip the switch again especially in an environment where theres still little kind of growth out there but just touch on a couple of things youre doing to drive that william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah sure rest assured that our teammates are highly focused and there are places that we can dial more specifically and you sort of seen it our consumer production was up over a linked quarter premier banking lending numbers sort of similar per branch production those type things so the places that we can dial in a little bit and then on the wholesale side its just a lot about training its a lot about hiring its a lot about market opportunity its a lot about dialogue with clients so we look at all the pitches kind of approach and were seeing really good activity but our teammates are on offense let there be no confusion i mean our teammates are on offense they are not in a defensive position trust me the shift for them happened quite quickly you know there was a you could hear it and feel it in terms of momentum people are attracted to come to work for our franchise for some of the same reasons as we have the capital and capability to invest in the future so rest assured that your points right i mean the battleship its hard to turn but in terms of its direction clear direction clear communication and clear focus from our teams thank you matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp
