call over to bill william henry rogers jr chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks ankur and good morning everybody and thank you for joining our call i know you have a busy day ahead of you the first quarter of was certainly an unusual and maybe impossibly and a historic one for our banking industry i am really extremely proud of our more than teammates who leaned into our purpose and continued to care for our clients and stakeholders reassuring them of truists position of strength and commitment to serve them throughout the quarter we continued to experience the benefits of our shift from integrating to operating as evidenced by improved organic production and increasing client satisfaction scores which in our branches ascended to new highs from the weeks after march based on the volatile and uncertain environment we successfully demonstrated the strength and resiliency of truists diverse business mix scale and market share granular and relationshiporiented deposit base and strong capital and liquidity but as well also discuss some of that positive momentum was offset by some higher funding costs and somewhat elevated expenses strategically we continue to take actions to optimize our franchise and focus our resources on areas where we have an advantage in the marketplace and at the same time simplify consolidate or exit certain activities to improve profitable growth mike will share some of those details later in the call well provide more details on the quarters results and other topical items throughout the presentation but first lets begin with our purpose on slides and in uncertain times it could be easy to focus on the short term at the expense of the long term which is why its important that we always lead with purpose at truist these slides are a powerful reminder that the most effective way to grow over the long term is to deliver on our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities but today my comments will be on this topic a little briefer to gauge investor interest and other topics our purpose statement intentionally begins with the words inspire and thats exactly what i witnessed while working closely with our teammates in march as i mentioned i was inspired by how our teammates leaned into purpose and care as they held numerous discussions with clients and stakeholders to answer their questions about the banking system to emphasize truists financial position and strength and help them move forward with their financial needs in addition to client care we provided last month there were many other ways we actualized our purpose throughout the quarter which we highlight on slide you can read more about these items and many of our other efforts to build better lives and communities in our corporate responsibility report which we published last week now ill walk through our first quarter performance highlights on slide quarter performance slide focus mostly on gaap or unadjusted results given that moerelated ph event exceeded our run rate last year going forward we intend to focus primarily on gaap results with exceptions of adjusted tangible efficiency and adjusted ppnr since intangible amortization expense remained significant due to the scale of the moe and has no impact on capital generation truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 truist reported first quarter net income of billion or a share up like quarter due to strong growth in adjusted ppnr lower merger cost partially offset by a more normal provision level compared to a year ago relative to the fourth quarter of eps decreased primarily due to lower net interest income and seasonality adjusted ppnr decreased sequentially consistent with our prior guidance as betterthan expected fee income due to higher capital markets activity was more than offset by lower net interest income and somewhat higherthanexpected expenses relative to the first quarter of adjusted ppnr grew and we delivered basis points of positive adjusted operating leverage reflecting a good start to the year asset quality remained strong and net chargeoffs continued to normalize consistent with our expectations we prudently built our alll ratio basis points to reflect the more uncertain economic environment balance sheet trends despite all the noise in midmarch were fairly expected and more business as usual and well cover more about loans deposits capital and liquidity later in the presentation to move into our digital and technology update on slide continued investments and progress in digital will be even more critical due to the close relationship between digital engagement primacy of relationships and deposits the good news is truist prioritized digital early in the merger building the truist digital experience organically and in the cloud which allows us to fully own the digital experience for our clients endtoend our first quarter results reflect our continued investments agility and momentum in the first quarter we opened deposit accounts digitally exceeding our internal expectations we saw strong growth in digital transactions and zelle in particular underscoring the importance of payments and money movement capabilities to our clients more broadly we had an incredibly productive technology quarter as we advanced our strategy to reimagine our capability set in the deposit space we launched a new datadriven deposit pricing engine which provides personalized relationshipbased rates for clients during account opening and will allow us to be even more targeted with respect to rate paid we also enhanced our digital lending capabilities with the launch of our commercial loan dashboard an industry leading solution that allows wholesale lending clients to track the status of their loans upload documents and eventually electronically sign documents our goal is to eventually incorporate this dashboard into one view our desired endstate integrated digital experience across payments lending and capital markets creating a seamless experience for our commercial and corporate clients entire relationship with truist turning to loans and leases on slide loan growth was solid in portfolios targeted for growth and lower in portfolios where weve intentionally pulled back average loan balances grew sequentially while endof period balances increased a more modest basis points the slower growth on an endofperiod basis was intentional and expected and reflects our strategic decision in the second half of last year to reduce production in certain lowerreturn portfolios including indirect auto and correspondent mortgage while also increasing rates and spreads from ongoing production ci balances increased on an average basis and on an endofperiod basis due to continued growth across cib and ccb reflecting the benefits of our capabilities and our markets consumer loan balances decreased basis points on average and were down from december reflecting ongoing runoff in student and partnership lending as well as lower indirect auto production truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 strategically were focusing our balance sheet on truist clients who have broader relationships while limiting our balance sheet usage with more single product and indirect clients were also evaluating ways to increase the velocity of our balance sheet increasing greater utilization of loan sales on securitization this allow us to be more impactful and increase returns in businesses such as service finance next ill provide some perspective on overall deposit trends starting on slide despite the unique events of midmarch average deposit trends during the first quarter were generally consistent with our expectations average deposit balance decreased driven by quantitative tightening inflation and movements to higher rate alternatives within the month of march more deposit flows were concentrated in the period from march to march and have largely been business as usual since including through yesterday deposit outflows during midmarch were primarily related to cig and ccb clients who chose to diversify into money market mutual funds and in some cases across multiple banks these outflows tended to be of higher cost nonoperational deposits and we also experienced deposit inflows as were both attracting new clients and expanding our relationships with existing clients retail production continues to improve due to our shift from integrating to operating and leading with the value proposition of truist one in the first quarter truist saw record new deposit production including yearoveryear uplift in branch account openings with improved client retention driving strong net new account performance commercial community banking had record new account growth in march and weve seen good momentum in the first couple of weeks of april as clients are beginning to move money to fund those accounts more noteworthy than overall deposit flows was the pace of the mix shift from dda as noninterestbearing deposits decreased to of deposits from previously this happened a little sooner than wed previously anticipated interestbearing deposit costs increased basis points sequentially contributing to our cumulative interest bearing deposit beta of so far in the cycle deposit betas accelerated relative to the fourth quarter due to the presence of higher rate alternatives and the previously mentioned shift from noninterestbearing dda into interestbearing products well continue to be attentive to client needs and relationships while maximizing the value outside of rate paid given higher investor interest and additional deposit details weve provided a closer look at our deposit base on slide truist has one of the most robust deposit franchises in the banking industry thanks to three key factors first truist has strong market shares in many of the fastest growing markets in the us truist currently ranks first second or third in deposit share in of the top markets those include cities like atlanta charlotte dc miami tampa raleigh durham among others making us the dominant player in the southeast and mid atlantic second truist has a granular retail leading deposit base that is insured andor collateralized which is the second highest in our peer group and an important source of stability in addition our commercial deposits are diversified across industry groups with no one sector representing more than of corporate and commercial banking deposits third were highly relationshiporiented as you can see from the table at the bottom of the slide the average deposit account at truist has been open for years during which time these relationships have broadened to include multiple products and services in retail small business banking we have over million deposit accounts with an average account balance of rsbb deposits are highly granular and of balances are insured in addition truist is the primary bank for the preponderance of those clients in our wealth business of the depositors have investments with truist wealth in our commercial community bank depositors have a payments lending or advisory truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 relationship with truist with the majority of that related to operating and treasury management products together these factors are a source of strength for truist and for our clients so now let me turn it over to mike to discuss our financial results in more detail michael b maguire chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you bill and good morning everyone ill begin with net interest income on slide for the quarter taxable equivalent net interest income decreased sequentially as higher funding costs and two fewer days in the quarter more than offset the effects of solid loan growth reported net interest margin decreased basis points while core net interest margin decreased basis points when you break down the decrease in the core net interest margin approximately basis points was driven by a shift in the funding mix from dda and other lowcost deposit products into interestbearing deposits and about basis points was due to our decision to conservatively carry more liquidity during the last few weeks of march moving to fee income on slide fee income was relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter and modestly exceeded our expectations in light of typical seasonal headwinds insurance income increased million largely due to seasonality yearoveryear organic revenue growth was mortgage banking income rose million primarily due to a gain on sale of the servicing portfolio which was partially offset by msr valuation adjustments income from core mortgage activity was relatively stable compared to the prior quarter wealth management income improved million benefiting from the increase in brokerage commissions asset flows and higher fees due to rising asset prices during the quarter wealth continues to build momentum as net organic asset flows which exclude the impact of market value changes were approximately billion for the quarter and have been positive for seven of the last eight quarters in addition we were pleased by the modest increase in investment banking and trading income led by strength in investment grade and highyield bond originations fixed income derivatives and loan syndications cibs performance continues to be aided by two idiosyncratic factors strategic hiring over the past two years as well as increased integrated relationship management activity with respect to irm capital markets fees from noncib clients increased sequentially and were up from first quarter other income decreased million primarily due to lower income from our nonqualified plan while fee income remains below its potential our investments in key areas such as insurance investment banking and wealth will continue to be a source of momentum as markets normalize and as our irm execution continues to mature turning now to slide reported noninterest expense declined million driven by a million reduction in merger costs due to the completion of integration activities and a million decrease in amortization expense the expense reductions i just described were largely offset by a million or a increase in adjusted non interest expense expense drivers included a million increase in pension expense and a million increase in regulatory charges due to higher fdic premiums we also experienced a million increase in operating losses which are reflected in other expense due to industry check fraud issues and an operating loss within truist insurance recognized prior to completing our truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 transaction with stone point as a company were committed to generating expense reductions and have undertaken a number of actions that help bend the expense arc at truist last week we announced a strategic realignment within our fixed income sales and trading business in which we discontinued certain marketmaking activities and services provided by our middle markets fixed income platform this platform was largely focused on mbsrelated sales and trading for depositories and had produced an unattractive roe this realignment will result in an approximate million run rate expense save with little ppnr impact and enable us to focus more on our core strategy of being a fulsome and premier investment bank for corporates sponsors and municipal issuers were also in the process of realigning our lightstream platforms with our broader consumer business with the goal of bringing the innovation digital capabilities efficiencies and cloudbased infrastructure of lightstream to truists broader client base this will reduce the cost of supporting a separate brand and strategy and enhance the experience and primacy with our existing and prospective clients in addition we continue to adjust our capacity and focus in mortgage to reflect current challenging market conditions and our own strategic focus on client primacy these actions among others are what drove the million of restructuring charges during the quarter furthermore weve also aligned executive compensation to truist to shareholder expectations which i shared with many of you about a month ago taken together we believe these as well as other actions were taking will increase our focus bend our expense curve and improve returns for truist moving to slide asset quality remained strong in the first quarter reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse loan portfolio leading indicators remained favorable loans to 89days past due decreased basis points sequentially and were down basis points versus the first quarter of our npl ratio was steady at a relatively benign basis points net chargeoffs increased basis points to basis points primarily due to ci and continued normalization in consumer and are consistent with prepandemic levels we became even more cautious in our outlook regarding cre fundamentals and in light of increased economic uncertainty we prudently increased our allowance by million and increased our alll ratio by basis points to in anticipation of an increasing risk environment were also tightening credit and reducing our risk appetite in selected areas while maintaining our throughthecycle approach for highquality longterm clients next given high investor interest i will dive deeper into cre on slide as we began the integration process to become truist we were very intentional about retaining the diversification benefits of the merger to achieve this outcome we carefully evaluated our various portfolios including cre to ensure we fully understood their combined risk profile and to establish how we would manage them going forward while we did not wholly pause cre production during this process we did deemphasize it until we aligned on a single gotomarket strategy as a result of this decision truists cre portfolio actually decreased by from the end of to the end of whereas our median peer grew cre our disciplined focus on diversification has also resulted in less cre concentration and risk relative to our peer group at yearend cre represented of our loan mix compared to at our median peer and the office segment comprised of our loan book versus at our median peer we maintain a high quality cre portfolio through disciplined risk management and prudent client selection we typically work with developers and sponsors we know well and have observed their performance through the cycle our exposure tends to be large cre with strong institutional sponsorship and we have reduced our truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 exposure to smaller cre the quality of our cre portfolio is also reflected in the federal reserves annual stress test results our disciplined approach to cre is reflected in our asset quality metrics which remains solid in the lower right you can see a snapshot of our office portfolio which had approximately billion in outstanding balances as of march and another area where truist has been riskaverse and highly selective over the past two years our office portfolio tends to be weighted towards class a properties within our footprint which we believe will perform better than large urban markets we have a great cre team that is very proactive in working with clients to get ahead of any problems criticized trends have increased over the past few months but we believe overall problems will be manageable given our conservative ltvs our reserves and the laddered maturity profile of the portfolio turning to capital and liquidity on slide our cet1 ratio increased from to as approximately basis points of organic capital generation was partially offset by basis points of cecl phasein while not included in our cet1 ratio aoci improved by billion from december to march of our billion of aftertax oci as of march billion is related to our afs portfolio billion is related to the frozen portion of the htm portfolio and billion is related to our pension plan we would expect the securities portfoliorelated oci to decrease by billion to billion by the end of or by approximately and thats in a static rate environment in addition this accretion will be a powerful driver of higher tangible book value per share over time the small glimpse of which we saw this past quarter with tangible book value increasing on april we also closed on the sale of a minority stake in truist insurance holdings which added approximately basis points to our capital ratios and provides flexibility in the future additionally we declared a strong common dividend of per share which was paid on march finally truist continues to have significant access to liquidity and a very robust liquidity manage process that includes internal and external stress testing as well as realtime monitoring of our liquidity position our average consolidated lcr improved during the first quarter and remains well above the regulatory minimum of we have access to approximately billion of liquidity including cash fhlb borrowing capacity unpledged securities and discount window capacity as a reminder government and agency obligations represent of our securities portfolio which produces about billion to billion of cash flow per quarter during the quarter we conservatively increased our cash position from billion as of december to billion at the end of march funded largely by callable fhlb advances and would expect that to somewhat normalize going forward given that activity has stabilized more broadly we do expect regulatory requirements around capital and liquidity to heighten but believe were in a strong position to respond given the already high expectations for an institution of our size the strategic and financial flexibility we have as a company and the orderly phasein period that would likely accompany potential changes and now i will review our updated guidance on slide looking into the second quarter of we expect revenues to be relatively stable compared to the first quarter as a modest decline in nii is offset by seasonally stronger insurance revenue adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase to linked quarter primarily as a result of higher incentivebased compensation from insurance revenue growth for the full year we now expect revenues to increase to compared to the decline from our previous outlook is driven almost entirely by a lower net interest income outlook given higher deposit and funding costs adjusted expenses are still expected to increase between and as i indicated earlier we remain focused on taking actions throughout the year to reduce costs truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 excluded from our adjusted expense outlook are two items first we are not including the impact of any potential incremental fdic surcharge or assessment after we receive clarity well provide an update on estimated impact secondly there will be some onetime costs occurring in and tied to preparing truist insurance holdings to transition its operating model to be more independent which is consistent with its new capital structure these expenses directly correlate to realizing significant value in the business over time we will not adjust for these expenses in our results but we will provide transparency our goal is still to produce positive operating leverage and positive adjusted ppnr growth for the full year excluding these two items the degree of difficulty has increased relative to january given higher funding costs our expectations for the net chargeoff ratio to be between and basis points sic and basis points for the full year is unchanged lastly excluding discrete items we now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately which translates to approximately on a taxable equivalent basis due to our adoption of recent accounting guidance regarding the amortization of new market tax credits this change simply shifts contra revenue in other income to the tax expense line and has no impact on the bottom line now ill hand it back to bill for some final remarks william henry rogers jr chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp great thanks mike so to conclude on slide truist is on the right path and im highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant postintegration potential as summarized in our investment thesis our goal financially is to produce strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers as we began to shift from integrating to operating several quarters ago we also made a strategic decision to focus our resources on areas where we have an advantage in the marketplace and are most synergistic with our core strengths since that time we focused on product solutions and distinctive experiences that are most relevant to our primary consumer and deposit households into our commercial corporate and high networth clients while reducing our investment in businesses and clients that are less strategically relevant with respect to returns on relationship opportunities we believe these changes are consistent with where the banking industry is likely to go from here were already realizing the early benefits of this shift for instance first quarter net new consumer checking account production was among the best weve seen since becoming truist driven by our continued focus on core deposit clients the attractiveness of new products including truist one and improved retention as well as flight to quality branch checking account production has increased since the launch of truist one and as i said earlier has accelerated up to compared to a year ago in the first quarter the steady improvement weve seen in client satisfaction has been driven by the distinct service our branch and care agents provide as well as improvements in our digital processes and procedures that originated in our client journey rooms as i indicated earlier im really proud of the care our teammates provided to our clients in march and this is reflected in higher voice of client scores during the last few weeks of the quarter lastly we continued to advance our integrated relationship management program by establishing longterm growth targets for our most strategic irm partnerships details of which i shared in december relative to the first quarter of last year these strategic partnerships have grown revenues by at the same time we truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 acknowledge that the environments tougher and strong balance sheet and expense management remain critical for our stakeholders in closing while uncertainty has increased truist is in a position of strength across a broad range of outcomes because of our diverse business mix dynamic markets conservative credit culture balanced approach to interest rate risk management strong profitability profile and our strong riskadjusted capital position i am truly optimistic about the future of truist as our more than talented teammates build on our momentum to create distinctive client experiences and deliver on our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities so with that ankur let me turn it back over to you for qa ankur vyas headinvestor relations truist financial corp great thank you bill alley at this time will you explain to our listeners how they can participate in the qa session as you do that id like to ask the participant to limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today question and answer section operator of course thank you operator instructions and well go ahead and take our first question from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys just wanted to start just on the deposit front good color you gave in terms of the relationships you mentioned in the deck that endofperiod was down and some of that was seasonal so just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on just how you saw deposits end the quarter and if youve seen stabilization and what kind of outlook you just see for the flow and mix of deposits from here thanks michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah good morning ken its mike thats right we saw really throughout the course of the quarter relatively stable flows actually if you think about sort of where we saw our balances evolve throughout the first two months of the quarter very typical we saw some seasonal outflows related to public funds we saw the expected impact of qualitative tightening which weve seen throughout the previous couple of quarters and so were probably down about or so and then in the last month of the quarter we really saw continued public fund outflows we saw a little bit of higher ratepursuant behavior we saw people cycling into money market accounts to a higher extent we saw some of our wealth clients cycle into investment accounts and ended down about for the quarter id say the bulk of the money in movement happened during that week that bill mentioned in our opening remarks as far as outlook is concerned its been business as usual and steady since really that first week in march and what our expectation frankly is that the impacts that were driving some pressure in the fourth quarter and the first twothirds of the first quarter will continue to put pressure on deposits probably to the tune of to truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and just my followup is just then what about that mix and how do you expect that mix of ddas to total as there is more cycling of that i think youre down to about in the first quarter what do you think michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc you had previously said you ph felt you could approach that 30over time has that view changed at all given whats happened william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah yeah ken this is bill precovid we were sort of at as you mentioned were around now were going to clearly migrate down to that high and sort of depending upon where rates are i think that ph sort of is the stabilization level as based upon what we know right now just to add to what mike said as well and continue to just focus on the positive side of the retail deposit production i just expect that engine to continue so while sort of on balance we might be down flattish to down 1orso percent that includes a really good positive production momentum we have in our core franchise ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood thank you william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah operator well move on to our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead blake netter q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi this is blake netter on the line for betsy good morning william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning blake netter q analyst morgan stanley co llc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 im wondering if you could could you talk about how youre thinking about the potential impact of tougher lcr requirements and indiscernible be announced in the near future and how should we think about your debt issuance plans and other potential impacts william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp sure michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp id say from a tlac perspective this is something that weve had our eyes on for a number of quarters and the entire industry has certainly companies our size weve studied the framework weve previously probably were considering tailored versions of tlac perhaps that will ultimately be the case but in the abundance of caution and the framework that weve assessed is sort of a traditionally applied framework the same that the largest banks in the country have applied and from our perspective our regular way issuance certainly given some reasonable phasein period will allow truist to comply really without much effort and to your question around debt issuance you saw we raised billion in january our expectation given truists scale and funding needs and perspective is that well be a relatively regular issuer and to the extent that we get a better sense for whats eligible and not eligible from a tlac perspective that may influence how we issue whether its at the holding company or the opco but i think the net of it is that we feel really wellprepared and positioned to comply with tlac to the extent that thats applied to truist blake netter q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and separately just one more question from me service charges on deposits came down sequentially this quarter can you talk about the potential for overdraft fees to get even lower from here william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah theyre going to continue to get lower blake we instituted our truist one which is sort of the a big part of the deposit generation and new client acquisition but its also our no overdraft fee account so those will continue to draft lower and those are in all of our guidance and everything that we talked about and theyre basically right on path where we thought theyd be blake netter q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp ph right okay operator well take our next question from john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hey good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi back to the deposit growth expectation just want to confirm down to is that on endofperiod balances and is that for the full year your expectation thanks michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah thats a quarterly view and im not sure thats going to sort of be linear in its progression if we think about just the impact of qualitative tightening and some of the work that weve done and certainly prior to this first quarter was just getting a sense for our share of the easing and how that may impact our share of the tightening and so that to is reflective of qt continuing on a quarterly basis and its also reflective of frankly ph just the rate environment that were in as people continue to assess bank alternative products where perhaps higher rates or investment products are an alternative thats a quarterly view john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it mike thank you and then separately also on the margin and deposit dynamics can you maybe talk to us about how you see this playing out in terms of the net interest margin progression from here and then also what do you expect is a fair throughcycle deposit beta i know youre currently at and i want to hear your thoughts there thanks michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp sure and we mentioned in our prepared remarks our net interest margin in the first quarter we were down on a reported basis about basis points and that really had two primary drivers the first was we also mentioned that we have a little bit more liquidity on the balance sheet that was something that we made the decision to do sort of in the abundance of caution and so while that doesnt really have an impact on nii because there is very sort of de minimis negative carry relative to the funding cost there it did swell the size of the balance sheet a bit so the denominator impact drove about basis points of net interest margin decline and then we also had just the overall funding mix shift which probably drove the bulk of the rest there is also a basis point in there for paa those same factors that drove our nim down basis points in the first quarter exist in the second quarter as well perhaps to and to some extent in terms of the behaviors maybe itll be a little bit more modest but you also have to quarterize some of those impacts and so our expectation is that nim probably has downside of another call it basis points in the second quarter as far as the second half probably have a more stable outlook for the nim weve mentioned before that weve sort of intentionally approached a more neutral kind of rate sensitivity position but i think beyond that its really truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 going to depend on some of these other factors the betas the mix that bill just talked about on the dda side whether or not we see credit spreads widen as an example is a factor too the beta that we have in our assumption around nii and nim you mentioned were at today that until now weve been exceeding our expectations this is the first quarter where we performed a little worse than we expected our spot beta today on a ibd basis is we expect that to migrate to the low for the full second quarter and we have a terminal outlook of john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks mike william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp ph thanks operator our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi im not sure if i should keep pushing the corvette analogy here but it just looks like the fuel efficiency isnt quite as good i dont know if youve put diesel fuel in the corvette by mistake or what the you closed branches in the first quarter so that should be good youre getting other merger benefits youve completed the integration phase and you guide for to revenue growth which is decent but also to expense growth and i isnt this the time when you go back to your management team and say hey you know were getting more cautious on lending as you indicated and we need to tighten some of the this expense spend and i get some of the expenses are fdic and pension minimum wage but thats true to some of your peers which are looking for positive operating leverage and i know you said positive operating leverage ph but then you have to higher both for revenues and expenses so just give a little bit more color about the efficiency of truist as you transition from integration to growth thanks william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp great and mike i am going to spare from the corvette analogy just try to sort of go right at it as mike said i mean were really were going to continue to focus on positive operating leverage the revenue guidance is really an nii guidance issue our continued focus on the insurance investment banking all the other things that comprise that were still very confident of and hopefully if markets really improve in the second half of the year might even have some upside but your point on the expense side is exactly right i mean we have call it or so sort of embedded in the categories that you talked about so the ability to manage is in that other component of that and trust me every business leader has a positive operating leverage plan and they are readjusting those plans based on particularly those that have an nii component to their plans and the things that they can do you saw already this quarter things that were doing that are more reflective of the strategy you talked about the realignment of fixed income consolidation of lightstream i mean in the past these might have been things that sort of would have been off the table now theyre firmly on the table like everything else as it relates to expenses well do more work in the mortgage area all the things with spans and layers real estate digitization automation truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 all of that is firmly on the table and a clear focus for us as we move into the rest of this year with a keen focus and eye on positive operating leverage mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then one separate question do you plan to rebrand lightstream to truist and if so does that mean youre going to have more of a national branding strategy william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and its interesting you are in the southeast midatlantic with truist and you go outside the region with a different brand so im just trying to reconcile your brand names william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah really sort of same way around actually so were really were going to eventually wind down the lightstream brand and increase the truist side of that we created lightstream for completely different reasons that dont really exist today as it relates to truist so weve got this incredible franchise incredible market really good digital capabilities and what were doing now is saying lets say bring all of those digital capabilities really fast turnaround times incredible net promoter scores with lightstream to all of the truist client base so the emphasis will be on the truist client base and then also with partnerships that are truist clients rather than sort of this national brand so im pleased with what we did i think we did all the right things we created this really cool capability but the comment i made earlier we were also supporting a separate brand and that has a lot of expense associated with it theres a lot of marketing and other things with that and were having incredible success with the truist brand so we want to bring it under that umbrella create some more efficiencies from an expense standpoint and then i think

relations truist financial corp alley maybe we just shift to the next person operator okay and our next question will come from erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc you mentioned that you good morning youre anticipating tighter capital and liquidity standards and bill as you think about growing your capital from here your starting point is do you feel like the build is now closer to and as you anticipate higher capital and liquidity standards and if so how should we think about your plans for dividend growth i suspect that buybacks would be lowest priority and also is there is some rwa mitigation that you could do in order to perhaps speed up that basis points of organic capital generation william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah erika thanks remember we are actually at today as weve completed the interest in truist insurance holdings so if we start with there i mean the mode were in right now i mean were comfortable where our capital level is but were in a capitalbuild mode right now until were not so we want to really understand the landscape understand the regulatory landscape be prepared weve got basis points or so of sort of organic capital accretion that comes into play thats post our dividend our dividend will continue to be important to us and well continue to support our dividend so i think weve got were at a good place right now with capital well continue to be in a little bit of a capital build mode so well sort of blow through that number you mentioned here in several quarters and then well see well just sort of see where the regulatory things line up and the opportunities that we have and i think weve got the most organic combined with financial and strategic flexibility on capital to respond to sort of anything that might come our way you did mention though and our focus is going to continue to be on supporting organic growth were going to maximize rwa but we dont need to reduce rwa so we dont need to change rwa from a capital standpoint but we do want to optimize it we do want to create more velocity around rwa which i talked about dividend being important and then ma on particularly things like insurance and then capabilities to create sustainable truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 advantages and then as you mentioned share repurchase is just not in our shortterm window i mean thats just not our focus right now erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my second question is sorry to make this another car analogy but a rotce is more like an f1 car rather than a corvette right but the conversation on your afs portfolio that was ph brewing over the quarter aside it feels like some of whats holding down your valuation is the puts and takes the specials that keep coming up and i wonder though where are you in terms of the optimization of this franchise because its pretty clear that the steps that you have been taking and it seems like based on mikes laundry list that you guys are accelerating has everything to do with optimization of this franchise and i wonder how youre weighing sort of pulling forward that optimization and i mean look theres always a continuous improvement process for every company right but is it better to just clean everything up this year and perhaps for the sake of positive operating leverage to think about cleaner and numbers when it comes to expenses because i do think that its very clear what the potential of this franchise is but theres always adjustments here and there and so i feel that your investors are less likely to see that visibility on that expense curve bend that you guys are aiming for william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah maybe let me try to break that up into two components if i understood the question so if the questions around the strategic parts of our business and optimizing those you are seeing a little bit of an acceleration around there thats not sort of a dramatic shift but you are seeing a speedup on that and its things around the edges and i talked a little bit about those today theres some more of those that were thinking through because as you note i mean our core franchise is so powerful and what we want to do is make sure that the resources that we have at this company are devoted towards growing expanding that incredible franchise so the things that we talked about about capital markets and lightstream i think are really good examples of those and you could argue they were probably a little accelerated maybe with a small a of accelerating if youre going to the balance sheet side are we going to do anything on the securities portfolio the answer to that is not at this time i mean theres just not a really good economic benefit for that and we want to be longterm protectors of shareholder value and so i think well stay the course there unless something were to change dramatically that would cause us to change our posture erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc indiscernible william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp indiscernible erika okay yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 yeah ph just wondering if just a followup it seems as if you have optimized and accelerated some of the initiatives and im wondering if you can tell your investors that your goal for is really sort cleaner quarters on expenses so that they could really see that expense curve in terms of your gaap eps power william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i think relative to the first part of that yes that would be the goal and i think theyre getting cleaner every quarter and theyre going to continue to stay on that flight path but when we have opportunities that we think are longterm beneficial were not going to miss those but i think your basic statement of will we have a cleaner quarter process in yes and i think they get cleaner every quarter along that path erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc perfect thank you operator our next question will come from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning bill good morning mike william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mike and maybe this is more directed to clarke on credit you guys have very strong credit quality obviously but you perked my interest with something that you said in the prepared remarks that your chargeoffs again theyre low went up by basis points but you cited ci which was interesting to me so the question is what and then you also pointed out that the allowance of course was built up for cre but you talked about reducing your risk appetite in selected areas so where are those areas number one and then in ci if you guys could elaborate what maybe what happened there and any comments also about your leveraged loan portfolio that i assume is included in ci as well clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp ph great hey gerard hey william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp clarke why dont you start with indiscernible clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 so as far as what areas are we focused and first and foremost what id say is that we want to maintain our throughthecycle lending approach as we always have for our clients so were not going to make dramatic shifts in our appetite or how we lend we just want to be more cautious and prudent where it makes sense so things like less exceptions more due diligence and some of the areas were focusing right now would be the ones you would expect higher leverage so leveraged finance would be one things like senior care given the market aspects of cre lowerend consumer things like that gerard so i think its more around being cautious but being consistent there for our clients and to your other question our leverage book is performing very well right now so i would just remind you all the portion that you would be focused on is about of our total loans portfolio is investment grade weve very modest hold levels our leverage multiples have come down over the last couple of years in that book and right now its performing very well we have npls at our ncos are at so very good overall performance and then as far as the ci losses in  theres nothing episodic there were coming off such extremely low levels if we go back into we were in the just a couple of basis point range and were up just a more toward a normalized range so nothing specific there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you clarke and then following up mike i mean you talked about the investment banking business how youve built it out with some strategic hires over the last two years and we know from the market conditions from some of your larger competitors its challenging out there are you guys comfortable with your revenue to expense area in investment banking now or do you really want to see or need the revenues to kind of really pickup as the market continues to pick up michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah ill start there and maybe bill may have something to add but the investment banking business is performing well it was a bright spot for us in the first quarter we have expectations that it will continue to perform well pipelines remain solid and i think that a lot of that is driven by the fact that weve been adding really high caliber sort of franchisetype talent to that platform not just recently but consistently over the years and so look i mean there is no doubt about it theres market interruptions transaction markets deal markets are a little harder but in sort of the middle market and uppermiddle market space where we feel like weve really got a powerful franchise we continue to get deals done for our clients on the corporate and sponsor side and so were still very supportive and optimistic about the investment banking business and look were managing it carefully and revenues will be highly correlated with expenses in that business but thats always been the case william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah and for us ph i mean to your margin question investment banking thats always been a good margin business and has had a lot of discipline over a long period of time and part of that sustainability i think you saw some of it this quarter is back to the earlier comments and questions were having about the strength in the franchise so being able to take advantage of this incredible franchise and client base really afford us this opportunity all across highgrade debt and equity irm revenue being up so it just creates more consistency and more confidence for us in that revenue base truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you for the insights
