turn the call over to bill william h rogers jr chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks ankur and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today our third quarter reflected strong progress in many areas overall however financial performance was mixed reflecting continued challenging market conditions strong spread income resulted from significant margin expansion that exceeded our guidance and strong broadbased loan growth credit quality remains excellent at the same time capital markets revenue did not rebound as anticipated and in fact declined linked quarter strategically we continue to realize the benefits of shifting from integrating to operating which ill share more on later i acknowledge that operating losses continue to be too high however other expense growth reflects targeted investments in talent and technology in key areas of longterm sustainable growth merger costs diminished again and our remaining decommissioning activities are mostly complete and will be finalized by year end well share details on each of these themes throughout the call im turning to our purpose on slide truist is a purposedriven company thats dedicated to inspire and build better lives and communities this commitment to purpose and our value of care cannot have been more apparent in how our teammates responded to each other and their clients in the aftermath of hurricane ian i experienced this firsthand when i visited with our teams in southwest florida soon after the storm subsided clients expressed their significant appreciation that we opened our branches to care for them during this time of loss the many truckloads of food water supplies and other critical items that we sent to the region made a real difference and the million donation from the truist foundation will continue to provide support to affected areas in florida and south carolina the rebuilding process has only begun and truist is committed to supporting these communities in the short term but also helping them be more resilient in the longterm and this is one of the many ways were living our purpose as you can see on slide in order to inspire its often necessary to be bold and to be first and thats exactly what we did on october 1st we made a significant investment in our teammates by raising our minimum wage to per hour the new minimum wage benefits approximately teammates about of whom are in clientfacing roles we strongly believe this action will drive purposeful growth and offset the estimated million increase in annual personnel expense through improved teammate recruitment and retention lower turnover expense better execution and all around better client experience in fact were already starting to see the benefits of higher minimum wage teller turnover in august and september was down about compared to the first seven months of the year and our branch vacancy rates have been cut in half since july we also advanced our commitment to inspire with the launch of truist one banking in july truist one is our differentiated suite of checking solutions that reimagine everyday banking including two new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit the flagship truist one checking account has zero overdraft fees and the capability provides qualifying clients the liquidity they need through a simple negative balance buffer truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 we also introduced the truist confidence account which provides consumers access to mainstream banking services and no overdraft fees these accounts meaningfully advance financial inclusion in our communities and have been embraced by new and existing clients since their launch overall branch deposit production has increased in august and september compared to the prior year despite having fewer branches were also in the process of rolling out our cash reserve deposit base credit line up to we began a pilot earlier this month and expect the cash reserve feature to be available across our footprint later this quarter now turning to slide merger costs totaled million down sequentially and yearoveryear as our integration activities wind down the final merger costs expected in the fourth quarter are primarily related to our decommissioning efforts which as i mentioned will conclude by year end the completion of merger activities is a monumental move forward that will reflect a seamless client experience simplify our narrative enhance our earnings quality improve capital and help us realize industryleading returns turning to our third quarter performance highlights on slide we earned billion or per share on a reported basis adjusted earnings totaled billion or per share up sequentially as adjusted ppnr growth was partially offset by higher provision as a result of our higher consumer net chargeoffs net interest income grew to a postmerger high benefiting from higher short term rates and well controlled deposit cost all of which drove significant margin expansion as well as strong broad based loan growth despite solid forward progress the pace of ppnr growth was weaker than we had anticipated primarily due to ongoing pressure on investment banking as well as unfavorable valuation marks taken at quarter end adjusted expenses increased linked quarter mostly as expected however operational losses remained elevated while we made a purposeful decision to proactively refund our clients for fraud losses our overall goal is to reduce them significantly to improve our results from the client experience this is an industrywide phenomenon part of our technology spend is directly related to this effort these investments include efforts to enhance identity authentication and fraud detection among others adjusted operating leverage was a strong basis points compared to the third quarter of last year reflecting strong net interest income growth combined with modest expense growth this momentum has helped us close the gap towards our goal of positive operating leverage for the full year asset quality remains excellent notwithstanding normalizing trends and a seasonal uptick and net chargeoffs within our consumer portfolios we deployed basis points of capital to support strong loan growth and completed the benefitmall acquisition which expands our capabilities and fills a strategic gap in our wholesale insurance business our capital position remained strong relative to our risk and profitability profile and were confident in our ability to withstand and outperform in a range of economic scenarios now turning to slide digital activity continues to increase from the first quarter levels reflecting strong momentum post integration this progress reflects our significantly improved agility and responsiveness from being on one digital platform yeartodate weve delivered three times more production releases across business retail and wealth than in all of client satisfaction with the digital experience has also improved rapidly each quarter truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 consistent with our pivot from integrating to operating our technology and digital teams are allocating more of their time energy and resources to transformation and innovation to that end we recently launched truist assist to our retail and wealth clients through our mobile and online banking platforms truist assist is our ai enhanced virtual assistant that leverages natural language processing and natural language understanding to interact and respond to client questions through september truist assist has been deployed to our personal banking clients and had been utilized by unique clients to handle interactions that otherwise might have occurred in a branch or contact center were also expanding lightstream both by enhancing the sophistication of its underwriting models through artificial intelligence and by piloting a new savings product to broaden its capability set in addition the recent acquisition of the arena platform from software startup zaloni will help accelerate our data journey through the development of a stronger integrated data infrastructure solution deployed in a hybrid cloud environment as a result our data quality analytics and speedtomarket will all significantly improve overall im highly optimistic about the potential of our increased investments and capabilities to enhance performance and client experience now turning to loans and leases on slide loan growth was strong and broadbased for the second consecutive quarter average balances grew billion or sequentially in part due to our shift from integrating to operating ci remained strong as average balances grew billion or ci loans grew across most cib industry verticals and product groups reflecting higher revolver utilization the current shift to banks from the bond market and our increased competitiveness for new and existing clients revolver utilization increased just over basis points to approximately the highest level since the second quarter of in our commercial community bank ci balances excluding ppp and dealer floor plan increased the seventh consecutive quarter of growth we achieved growth across almost all of our ccb regions residential mortgage balances increased billion or reflecting previous correspondent mortgage production and slower prepayment speeds excluding mortgage consumer and card balances increased a strong growth in prime auto service finance lightstream recreational lending and sheffield more than offset runoff in our partnership and student portfolios production in our consumer finance business is up yearoveryear reflecting good business development momentum with service finance abating inventory shortages within sheffield and rac and improved automated decisioning capabilities across the board which ultimately improves consistency efficiency and creates better client experiences near term our loan growth outlook remains healthy as our pipelines are relatively strong and teammates continue to shift their capacity from integrating to operating and take advantage of new tools in their toolkit over the medium term loan growth may moderate as clients absorb and digest the impact of higher rates higher inflation and slowing growth we also expect growth in residential mortgage and prime auto to slow going forward as we shift our capital towards higher return opportunities truist continues to remain well positioned to advise clients across a broad range of economic scenarios given our capabilities talented teammates and increased capacity post integration truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 now turning to deposits on slide average deposits decreased billion or just under in the third quarter driven by tightening monetary policy reduced saving and a response for higher inflation and seasonal patterns deposit costs were very well controlled reflecting truists strong retail and commercial franchise and our enviable market share position in addition our lines of business and corporate treasury teams continued to deliver excellent execution against our thoughtful strategy to be attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid as a result interestbearing cumulative deposit betas have been thus far well below our modeled assumptions as the interest rate environment evolves well continue to take a balanced approach to managing deposit growth and rate paid particularly given our broad access to other forms of funding before i turn it over to mike id like to acknowledge and thank daryl bible he has built a bestinclass finance function he played a key essential role in the success of our merger and hes really been incredibly supportive in helping mike transition into the cfo role many of you in the investment community know daryl well and appreciate his knowledge and transparency which will continue to be hallmarks of truist going forward im also excited to introduce mike maguire as our new cfo most recently mike led truists consumer finance and payments businesses including lightstream service finance and sheffield and auto finance he was also responsible for our enterprise payment strategy group and wholesale payments businesses including treasury solutions merchant services and commercial card mike is a strategic banker a purpose driven leader with an exceptional depth of experience across our enterprise and a deep understanding of how technology is shaping our operating environment hes truly an industry thought leader in the fintech space well certainly draw on this experience as mike assumes his new role during this time of exciting transformation so mike with that im going to turn it over to you michael b maguire chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you bill and good morning everyone before i begin i would also like to thank daryl for his guidance and his support throughout my transition into the cfo role im excited about the opportunity and im confident that the transition will be seamless for all of our stakeholders i also want to thank my teammates in the financial organization for welcoming me and for their support we have a really talented team and im look forward to i look forward to working with all of them for our analysts and investors ill be on the road soon and hope to meet as many of you as possible this is really a great opportunity and im excited about helping take truist to new heights now moving to slide for the first for the quarter net interest income increased sequentially to billion as higher shortterm interest rates and strong loan growth more than offset lower purchase accounting accretion core net interest income was up a strong deposit costs remained wellcontrolled reflecting the strength of our deposit franchise lower purchase accounting accretion was the result of elevated accretion in previous periods due to conversion activity and slowing prepays in the current period reported net interest margin increased basis points while core net interest margin increased basis points driven by similar trends as net interest income truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 moving to slide fee income decreased million or sequentially insurance income decreased million primarily due to seasonally lower property and casualty commissions investment banking and trading income decreased million as lower fees from structured real estate investment grade in highyield bonds and syndicated leverage finance were partially offset by increased ma fees wider credit spreads tightening liquidity and general macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty are all contributing to slower activity levels despite these current headwinds we continue to make strong strategic progress within corporate investment banking capital markets revenue from noncorporate investment banking clients is up yearoveryear as our commercial community bank commercial real estate and wealth teammates continue to learn how to successfully partner with cib to deliver strategic advice to our clients our lead table position has improved across most products including equity capital markets highyield investment grade and syndicated leverage finance given their strategic progress we intend to continue to take advantage of the challenging environment to invest in truist securities by selectively adding talent to drive long term share gains as weve successfully done during previous market disruptions other income excluding impacts from our nonqualified plan decreased million linked quarter primarily due to valuation related marks compared to a year ago other income decreased million as a result of lower investment income and valuation marks on sbic related and other strategic investments turning to slide adjusted noninterest expense increased million or sequentially reflecting forward focused investments in talent and technology as well as elevated operational losses professional fees and outside processing expense increased million on an adjusted basis as we advanced critical projects including investments in cybersecurity contact center modernization fraud detection and the buildout of our inhouse payments capabilities other expense increased million primarily due to higher operational losses personnel expense increased million on an adjusted basis reflecting strategic and purposeful additions in technology commercial community banking cib consumer finance and wealth as well as the benefitmall acquisition compared to the third quarter of last year adjusted noninterest expense only increased this modest increase was driven by higher operational losses and investment spend which were partially offset by mergerrelated cost savings in software and net occupancy expense overall we continue to focus on generating expense reductions in certain areas to fund longerterm investments in talent and technology and to generate ongoing operating leverage as an example we believe recent technology investments to enhance identity authentication fraud detection among other factors will mitigate operational losses also with the conversion behind us we have additional flexibility to rationalize certain businesses such as mortgage where capacity exceeds demand lastly we have our final leg of data center related technology savings that is expected to materialize throughout the fourth quarter below the line our third quarter results also reflected an effective tax rate of down from in the second quarter primarily due to discrete tax benefits arising from final trueups to our tax return we continue to expect our normal effective tax rate to be which translates to on a fully taxable equivalent basis truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 moving to slide asset quality continues to be excellent reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse portfolio leading credit indicators remain strong nonperforming loans decreased basis point and loans to days pastdue decreased basis points net chargeoffs remained benign at basis points up basis points from the prior quarter primarily due to normalizing trends and seasonality in certain consumer portfolios our total allowance increased million to support our loan growth and the alll ratio decreased basis points due to strong portfolio performance and growth in higher quality loans partially offset by a moderately slower economic outlook moving on to slide our cet1 ratio decreased from to as we deployed capital to support strong loan growth and to complete the benefitmall acquisition we also increased the dividend to per share beginning in the third quarter reflecting our confidence in our improving earnings trajectory overall our capital position remains strong in light of our risk and profitability profile and we maintain a strong liquidity position with access to multiple sources of funding for incremental loan growth turning now to slide ill next outline the strategic rationale and financial impact of two recently announced insurance acquisitions first benefitmall closed on september 1st providing a scaled entry into wholesale employee benefits and filling one of the remaining strategic gaps in our capability set benefitmall is expected to add million of annual revenue at an initial ebitda margin in the mid that well build to the mid30 over time as synergies are realized the transaction also has potential irm benefits within truist insurance by supporting our brokers at mcgriff our retail insurance business and also outside truist insurance with our corporate and commercial clients we also recently announced acquisition of bankdirect capital finance strategically bankdirect effectively doubles our premium finance business broadens our capabilities to include life insurance and expand our west coast presence pro forma we estimate truist insurance holdings will be the number two premium finance player in the market after this deal closes later this quarter bankdirect brings with it a billion loan portfolio with strong projected growth attractive profitability limited credit risk and short duration while both acquisitions are expected to be dilutive initially we believe they are strategic and financially attractive over the long run so ill now provide new guidance for the fourth quarter looking into the fourth quarter we expect a middouble digit basis point increase in both our core and reported net interest margin due to benefits from the recent rate hikes and a projected basis point hike in november these will rebound sequentially driven by insurance income improving due to seasonality solid organic growth and the full impact of the benefitmall acquisition the extent to which investment banking fees improve will be dictated by levels of capital markets activity adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase approximately as the increased minimum wage investments and revenue producing businesses and technology and acquisitions are partially offset by the impacts of cost savings putting these pieces all together we expect adjusted ppnr to grow approximately with some upside based on the realization of investment banking pipelines based on our yeartodate results and fourth quarter expectations were on track to achieve positive operating leverage for the full year truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 we remain consistent with our expectations that the net chargeoff ratio will be between and basis points for the full year due to our performance yeartodate and normalizing trends across our loan portfolio with that i would turn it back to bill to conclude william h rogers jr chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp great thank you mike continuing to our strategic shift on slide earlier this year i expressed my view that the first quarter was a strategic and financial turning point for truist our third quarter results build upon the second quarter progress even as market conditions diminished overall ppnr trajectory progress is real and is palpable weve made significant progress in our digital and technology areas as evidenced by our improving mobile app ratings and enhanced client experience within treasury and payments and many other new features and capabilities that strengthen the financial confidence of our clients speed to answering in our care centers is well below our initial service level agreements and more investment will improve the efficiency as well loan production in the third quarter was the highest its been at truist up compared to the second quarter branch loan and deposit production are up a solid and like quarter respectively as teammates become more confident with processes and systems but also improved solutions and capabilities irm referrals to our wealth businesses increased sequentially and the amount of income generated from irm referrals by our commercial community bank was the second highest ever both highlighting the power of our advice driven and client centric model our brand awareness was up almost basis points in the third quarter while our peers were flat to down and our brand consideration which measures whether consumers are giving truist a serious thought was basis points and ranks us fifth highest in our markets having only been alive for that brand for three years almost all of her client satisfaction scores are ascending and in many cases at their highest level since weve become truist the financial benefits of the momentum are being realized and will be increasingly visible as market conditions normalize and mergerrelated expense noise abates to conclude truist is on the right path and im highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post integration potential which is clearly summarized in our investment thesis on slide strategically we have shifted from execution to execution transformation and growth were investing in digital and technology as we reduce cost including operational losses were simplifying our processes and operations and we are acting on our purpose each and every day with a singular goal of improving our client experience were also intensely focused on capturing the significant integrated relationship management and revenue synergy potential we have as its squarely in the center of building better lives for our clients these shifts in activity do not require incremental risk appetite or capital just execution and focus both of which lie within the sphere of control externally while we believe the economy is generally healthy persistent high inflation and a rapid tightening monetary policy combined with geopolitical tensions have reduced visibility and increased uncertainty as we move into truist is nevertheless well positioned across a broad range of economic outcomes given our adviceoriented model for clients conservative credit culture diverse business mix and a strong capital position relative to our truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 risk profile and our significant performance momentum as we continue the shift from integration to execution and growth so ankur let me turn it back over to you for qa ankur vyas executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp thanks bill jake at this time if you dont mind will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session as you do that id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one followup so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today question and answer section operator of course operator instructions and we will begin with gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning guys william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc bill you mentioned that you guys had a positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis of basis points can you give us some color what youre thinking about positive when you look at adjusted positive operating leverage for the next months what do you think that could come in at william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i think well obviously for the balance of the year we talked about this as well that i think well have positive operating leverage for the year as we look into obviously there are a lot of puts and takes theres a lot of uncertainty headed into that but positive operating leverage is going to be a core tenet of what we do so if we look at the revenue potential in terms of the loan growth and deposit production weve had being able to capitalize on those opportunities with those clients as we move forward so even if the economy slows down a bit we still have a lot of momentum in that area weve got great strength in our insurance business weve got great strength in our overall capital markets business wealth has been building its capability so weve got a lot of engines and tailwind from that side and then weve got a lot of tailwind on the cost saves so well complete the bulk of the merger cost saves at the end of this year but heading into next year is really where we get to leverage all those if you think about the concept of you put two things together now you make those two things more efficient so those opportunities for truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 digitization and automation were consolidating our card platform all the things thatll continue on in terms of cost saves so im just i dont like giving specific guidance on operating leverage for the year other than to say that will be a core tenet and component of how we plan for the future gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as the followup question you pointed out that the deposit beta was on a cumulative basis and without the brokered cds and that was below your models two things can you tell us what your model wouldve suggested the deposit beta would have been and then second using the forward curve what do you think you end up with the final cumulative deposit beta thank you michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp hey good morning gerard its mike im happy to take that one so youre right weve been very pleased by the performance of the deposit portfolio so far at i think we said earlier this year we expected the betas to be closer to as we get to the second half of the year we still expect that to be the case by yearend in terms of a terminal beta very very hard to tell weve seen probably some lag given the rate at which rates have increased and so we do expect there to be some catchup but whether or not itll be to the tune of the previous cycle in the mid or beyond will be well observe that together gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you mike michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp okay operator well move to ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning everyone thank you just wanted to ask a question on funding and deposits you guys are showing fairly good resiliency as is the industry just give a little more context of what youre expecting to see in terms of mix shift and also your thoughts it looked like you did add a bunch of wholesale borrowings relative to your incremental cost of funding through deposits so just help us think about how youre thinking about liability structure and deposit growth thanks michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp ken good morning its mike ill start here as well again we have been very pleased from the deposit perspective with only a sequential decrease of and so very pleased by how the balances are hanging in there we are expecting i think over the near term to continue to have some pressure on deposits as well as truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 some pressure on mix we did see some shift from dda into interestbearing thats been a moderate shift so far and were still well above levels that we experienced precovid but we are beginning to see that shift to take place in terms of shortterm borrowings youre right we are accessing brokered markets we are accessing shortterm markets and do expect that to continue over the intermediate term but dont expect that to shift significantly as we think about funding loan growth for one has been very very high so far yeartodate we do expect loan growth to moderate somewhat which should alleviate some of that gap but between the deposit balance levels between leveraging some of the securities portfolio running off to the tune of billion to billion per year accessing some of the wholesale markets which is a pretty wide array of tools and even thinking about the capital markets we feel really good about our funding capability william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and ken maybe just to ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay understood yeah go ahead william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah maybe just to add to that in terms of the first part of the question too is just the strength of our deposit franchise its pretty granular under weve got really good market share but what were seeing and i talked about this in my prepared comments our productions really strong truist one has been really successful our teammates have really responded clients and both new clients and existing clients have really responded investments in treasury and payments and so were leaning into this in terms of our own capabilities from the deposit production side and then for the fourth quarter remember the third quarter has got some seasonality in things like public funds for example where thats a strong area for us so i think well be sort of stable in the fourth quarter and then mike talked i think eloquently about the funding side ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and just one quick followup just can you just give us a sense of where youre reinvesting the cash flows that are going back into the securities portfolio versus whats rolling off thanks guys michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah i mean the cash flow thats coming off is being invested in the loan portfolio william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp there is de minimis investing to support our cra efforts but the bulk of the cash flow is being invested in loans ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp the great news is we have something to deploy towards which is perfect right ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yep understood thank you operator moving on to ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning bill good morning mike william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so bill you saw nii saw a nice sequential growth and its likely to continue to grow into given your outlook plus the asset balance asset sensitive balance sheet so i guess based on your comments to gerard of betas in the mid or maybe a little bit higher do you think you can continue to grow nii on a sequential basis as we look ahead over the next few quarters adjusted for seasonal impacts and maybe just talk about some of the puts and takes involved in that william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah mike ill let you start and ill talk about that as well michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah ryan good morning thanks for the question youre right i mean look weve got really good trajectory going into  with nim as we mentioned in our guide expected to increase or so basis points look as long as rates continue to increase we expect to continue to see some nim expansion at some point i think we all expect to achieve this terminal policy rate and whether its higher longer or begins to decline well see truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 from an nii perspective well obviously benefit from that nim expansion over that period and then i think as nims begin to feel some pressure we feel good again today weve got really nice earning asset growth we expect that to moderate but should offset any impact over the intermediate term of the decline in nims we see from a rates perspective as a relatively stable period william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp indiscernible mikes point a lot of it all depends on loan growth and what we see going into next year really positive momentum through this quarter which i think will continue into the fourth quarter it all gets a little murkier as we head into next year but i like the momentum and the production and the pipelines and the relevance and the competitiveness of our franchise right now from that standpoint ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it bill maybe a bigger picture question for me so i think at a recent conference you highlighted that you expected expenses to grow in which makes sense given youve done a handful of deals theres pressure from inflation however when we think back on the drivers of the merger we were talking about bestinclass growth improving returns and i know weve now made this shift to offense but when i speak to investors i get the sense i feel were not quite there yet well i know youre not giving guidance what do we need to see for this to begin to come through whether its operating leverage or better than peer expense growth and just how are you measuring the success of all these efforts william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i think overall ive talked about this its the measurement of can we grow revenue longterm over time and ppnr faster and relative to our market opportunities and i think that opportunity sits squarely in front of us i think if i look at the things that contribute to that and the areas of production like loan production aum production deposit production id argue actually were sort of getting to sort of a peak kind of performance in those areas as it relates to the expense side and this stuff just doesnt go quartertoquarter youre just theyre going to have different levels of investment weve made a conscious decision and while ill acknowledge im cranky on the operating losses side so operational losses i think weve got some opportunity there i see some improvements coming but that has been longer and taken longer than i anticipated but were consciously investing in some areas so were consciously investing in investment banking and wealth and insurance and you know as well we got a good track record here when times are a little bumpy and the opportunity is there weve taken advantage of it and thats proven to be really really smart investments on our standpoint so were sort of unabashed about that and that has a quartertoquarter implication to it and i just have to absorb it and take it because im confident that were doing the things that will create better opportunity for us and allow us to gain share over time so long answer to a short direct question i think we can grow disproportionately over time it just wont look like that quartertoquarter and i think look at the production look at the capabilities that were creating today and im confident in manifesting those towards the future truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for all the color bill william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yep thanks ryan operator and betsy graseck with morgan stanley has the next question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi its betsy how are you doing william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc good thank you i wanted to just dig into a couple of things one is on loan growth its been really strong and i heard the comments around how youre funding it and how youre thinking about driving that from here i wanted to get a little bit of an understanding on how youre thinking about the quality of the book relative to its ability to absorb this interest rate hike so obviously weve had about basis points so far were going to get at least another 150plus basis points over the next quarter or so and how are you assessing your borrowers ability to pay back are you all too worried about credit risk i know you gave the guide for the full year ncos which im wondering why not having have brought that down given the performance you had to date so just the few questions on credit from that perspective thanks william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah ill start betsy if its okay ill also turn it over to clarke hes itching to get in and talk about credit quality and the quality of our portfolio and what weve put on the books and weve not diminished our commitment to credit quality were taking our clients through the appropriate stress testing process i mean were underwriting at new rates and new environments so i think our production just reflects our just competitiveness i mean our ability to win more size and relevance with our clients and then you see that reflected right now in our reserve particularly on the wholesale side the quality actually is i might argue is ph might improving so clarke why dont you embellish that if you would clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 yeah thanks bill and i agree with you we are very careful in our underwriting right now so were looking obviously at rate shock and the ability to absorb that were looking at other things like pricing power and their margins given supply and input cost and inflation looking at clients investment decisions how they are deploying capital their liquidity their balance sheet and just overall strength so we feel really good about the core underwriting fact id tell you for the quarter about of our ci production was investment grade or near investment grade credit so really high quality there and as far as our nco guidance for the full year we feel really good about where are but do remember we normalize as we go into the fourth quarter from the consumer standpoint and we have the seasonal impact so thats really truly the consumer side that may increase ph also some betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it and then just digging in a little bit on the commercial side on this theme can you remind us how you are thinking about your insured national credit exposure you know what that is leverage lending i know legacy suntrust has a bigger skew in their business model to that but with the combined organization its been reduced to bit as a percentage of total so just give us a sense to how big those books are today how theyre trending and how much capacity you have to lean in with the bigger balance sheet you got now thanks william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah clarke you want to take it clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah maybe i will start it bill first from a snc standpoint were in really good shape we just went through the exam and had great results i feel very good about that we have about billion in outstandings in our snc books so its about of our balances and it has been fairly steady or so so its a very diversified book we feel really good about that as far as our leverage finance book just remember thats about of our total book however over half of that is investment grade clients so really would be more in the sponsored or noninvestment grade side that book is performing extremely well today so minimal npls weve had about basis points of losses and our criticized are in good shape so while theres been disruption and challenges in the market our overall performance has been very very good william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp i think you characterized it right but part of the benefits of the merger is the diversification of that portfolio by definition of the denominator so we havent grown it in proportion to the increase in the size of our business and its a welldiversified leverage portfolio its a welldiversified exposures are not significant to any one person and its about sponsors and about on us so this is a business that supports our client base and its categorized as leveraged but its really supporting the growth in our client base and consistent with our strategy of helping our clients with their business lifecycle so its a little bit different and a little bit more focused on us component truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you operator mike mayo with wells fargo will have our next question mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi can you hear me william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc ill continue my analogy with your franchise indiscernible i mean clearly in the countrys sweet spot for population growth i mean i keep meeting more of investing clients that have moved to new york to florida permanently entire firms and so youre certainly in the sweet spot you did mention momentum and certainly nii and loan growth and how youre going from defense to offense so i get it but then i hear bill your target for positive operating leverage of over it just seems like with the target like that youre aiming for the charlotte motor speedway instead of indianapolis right and it seems like and this is at a time when your peers are showing much greater positive operating leverage and they dont have this unique inmarket merger with these incredible synergies that are possible so i know youre not giving too much guidance for next year right now but can you just talk about whatever headwinds may be going away you talked about the operational losses it seems like youre doing a lot for your customers youre making ph them whole more than others perhaps youre doing a lot for your employees youre raising what they get paid but im just thinking about the shareholders here and so what are some of the headwinds that may or may not go away and what are some of the tailwinds that you think well see more of william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah thanks mike and well continue to keep the indiscernible i guess but if we define speed as related to how are you doing against your markets i look at the loan deposit aum the production side id say we actually had a really good high rate of speed and id say were at a speed that reflects the opportunity that sits in our market so if we define it that way if we define the opportunity which i agree with is to have better improved positive operating leverage over time and increased revenue and ppnr growth we also have to invest to make that happen so we like you see the same things that youre seeing in our markets and we got to make sure that we invest in those and again i wish it sort of balanced out quartertoquarter it just doesnt so the opportunity is for us to invest right now and id say gain share long term in areas i mentioned before like investment banking like insurance and like wealth were just going to do that and i think thats going to have a good longterm impact for truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 us youve seen this before youve seen this movie and you know how well it ends for us so we know how to do this so im very confident on that side and then the part about operational losses and the commitments that we made to our clients those are also good longterm decisions i mean look we were in the middle of a merger we gave the benefit of doubt to a client whenever there was a benefit of a doubt i think long term thats going to create sustainable longterm relationships and the same thing with teammates increasing minimum wage is fantastic for shareholders i cited some of the stats that were seeing already in improved turnover and improved vacancy rates i didnt mention the care center were seeing that as well so long term thats going to have a tremendous benefit for our shareholders as well as our teammates so im confident i think were materializing the things that we want to have its just not coming in quarterto quarter as id like its not as matched as id like there are some pesky things that i think will come down and im already seeing that at the end of the quarter and the first of this quarter in terms of operational losses so we can have a cleaner more focused easier to understand and easier to have the production and those things result in the kind of ppnr growth that i think were able to do long term mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so a followup even if i can see the speed part i guess the cost of gas is quite high and maybe mike from your perspective coming into the cfo spot things that you might be able to do to control the expenses as bill was alluding to michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah mike good morning and happy to react to that i think first and foremost still at this point absorbing and coming in and meeting the team getting a sense for where we are look bill made some great points i dont come to the table with some predefined view or silver bullet as it relates to these things the headwinds that bill talked about minimum wage inflation some of the investments that were prioritizing theyre important but then again we have some great tailwinds as well whether it be realizing the benefits of the savings i think theres some benefit from an automation perspective some work were doing thats in more nascent phase and then just overall productivity i mean and look if if i think weve got great track record in terms of being able to manage expense if and when that becomes a more important priority based on market conditions but no i think bill said it well mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator now well move to our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess one followup first for clarke on the reserves and clarke apologies if i missed it but can you remind us whats the base case for the weighted unemployment rate thats baked into your reserving at truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 the end of the quarter and i guess as we think about sort of what the next months could look like what are the other one or two big inputs that could change the reserving outlook other than unemployment thank you clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp thats a great question our base case which we weight at we have unemployment going up to and then going higher into the mid as we go into and beyond so clearly a little more pessimistic as we ran the reserves this quarter i would say for us other big drivers would be a housing hpi would be another input there in our models and youve already mentioned gdp so from our standpoint the big driver for us would be the scenario weighting and the scenario outlook would have the biggest impact on our reserves obviously versus other things like our mix production and overall portfolio performance but right now i think the scenario outlook would be the biggest driver ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just one followup bill for you as we look at the next stage i mean obviously bbt suntrust history of acquisitions a lot of your peers might be struggling in terms of deposit deposit pricing given what the fed might be doing talk to us in terms of as we look forward the next year or two appetite for bank ma extending the franchise and how you think about that william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean right now we have the best franchise to invest in and its called truist thats where our focus is and thats where our opportunity is and ability to expand and create more capacity within our existing markets is really our primary focus right now ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you operator well move to matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning can you guys talk about the openness to maybe some restructuring of the securities portfolio obviously rates have gone up a lot and the yields on your current book are a lot lower so it will cost a lot to restructure a big part of it but there might be some opportunities here and there as you think about the strong capital generation and what to use capital for michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah hey matt its mike good morning and happy to react to that as of this moment there are no plans to restructure those securities portfolio i think i mentioned that we do view the portfolio as a tool for funding loan growth as that continues its creating cash flow of approximately million to million per year truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah and matt i mean today were redeploying it into the growth in our business and you acknowledge that would be very expensive and what we try to do is look at that securities portfolio over time and so were going to take that cash flow and right now weve got great opportunities to reinvest it and not take a capital hit for the securities portfolio i would rather use that capital to invest in our business matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just separately you mentioned earlier some mix shift out of auto and mortgage can you frame how much you expect that could be over time and then maybe you mentioned it but just where is the mix shift going if its out of mortgage and auto what are you leaning into thank you william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah matt just basically sort of an overall return focused and make sure that were maximizing our capital as we see some of the returns and the mortgage business and the auto business being a little bit more stressed we want to make sure were serving our clients and were doing a great job in doing that but by the same token were seeing the other opportunities in our commercial portfolio and our consumer portfolio so we just want to get the right balance and a return focus versus weve never been sort of the growth for growth sake we want to be returnoriented i want to maximize the return on the capital that were investing in the portfolio matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it thanks ankur vyas a executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp and jake i think weve got time thanks matt william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks matt ankur vyas a executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp jake weve got time for one more question operator and that final question will come from erika najarian with ubs truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hey erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc i just i had one followup question bill you got asked this several times but i just wanted to make sure your shareholders understood what youre saying youve been asked a lot about delivering operating leverage at the same time dislocation creates opportunity and this is also a sort of once in a cycle help from rates right in terms of operating leverage getting help helping the denominator so is the message here really like that you are going to always try to deliver positive operating leverage as a way of truists life but you are seeing opportunities to invest today and as we think about the tougher part of the cycle whether we fall into recession next year and we dont have rate hikes helping your investments today are going to help truist deliver above average ppnr over a longer period of time other than just now when youre getting a lot of help from rates william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp i think thats really well stated and i wish i had stated it as well as your question so no i think thats exactly right and as i mentioned i mean positive operating leverage will be a hallmark of what we do so that is thats core and focus of what we do we just cant be wed to that quartertoquarter when we see an opportunity so were going to have positive operating leverage this year itll be a little less than wed hoped for six months ago but were investing and i think its going to create not only better operating leverage but more importantly strong ppnr growth for the future and we just have to make sure that were for the benefit of our shareholders thinking long term and thinking about this incredible opportunity that sits in front of us and maximizing our ability to capitalize on it so i think you stated it actually quite well erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my last question is for clarke thank you so much for sharing that data on your acl and just in terms of how cecl works if we do hit a unemployment rate which is your base case does that mean that you have to then weight worst scenarios in that in other words do you say okay we hit thats our base case we dont have to build reserves further or does that model say oh were at it could get worse so we now need to build for something worse than clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp great question erika i would say keep in mind weve run multiple scenarios so we have our base case which i described we also run a much more severe set of downside scenarios and as we look forward those scenarios get worse as well even if the baseline deteriorates some additionally so we weighed all of that and we look at it truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2022 each quarter and so even if the baseline is at one place the downside scenarios maybe more and would be more severe so were going to look at all of that and decide how we weight all of those factors in determining the allowance and so yes i mean the downside scenario could push it even further even if the baseline is going up erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you ankur vyas executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp all right thank you erika that completes our earnings call if you have any additional questions please feel free to reach out to the
