over to bill william henry rogers chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks brad and welcome to the team good morning everybody and thank you for joining our call today i dont think its a surprise to anybody on this call that the increasing levels of uncertainty in our economy the impact of interest rates on funding cost and this sort of postmarch operating environment for our industry are impacting our results and plans truist though was specifically built to increase our flexibility to respond to any condition to fulfill our purpose and commitment to all stakeholders capital and liquidity have taken on an increased focus and although truist is currently wellpositioned were also intentionally building future flexibility this environment also challenges us to move faster with greater intensity to tighten our strategic focus and rightsize our expense chassis to reflect the new realities we also have flexibility and strength in our balance sheet to support our focus on our unique core client base and market opportunity these decisions are less incremental and more time bound than the ones previously made during our shift from integrating to operating mike will highlight some of these decisions in his comments and ill close with some of the underlying momentum while these changes will be manifested over time this is not business as usual and reflects an important and significant pivot for truist and for our leadership team well provide more details about these topics in our second quarter results throughout the presentation but before we do that let me start where i always do on slide on purpose mission values truist is a purpose driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities and id like to share some of the ways we brought that purpose to life last quarter in may we announced the launch of truist long game our mobile app that leverages behavioral economics to reward clients for building financial wellness at a high level users set goals save money and earn rewards that are deposited into a truist account as they make progress toward their savings goals based on early data users tend to play four to five times a week with strong retention and weve seen positive trends towards new client acquisition this is also the first product from our truist foundry our very own startup tasked with creating digital solutions to help meet clients where they are truist has also highlighted small business owners through our small business community heroes initiative which is all about focusing on the small business owners who work tirelessly to serve our neighbors create jobs and build our communities and help drive our economy our branch teammates are visiting and connecting with tens of thousands of small business clients to say thank you and have a caring conversation to assist with their unique needs the response so far has really been excellent and our outreach efforts has helped drive a increase in net new small business checking accounts during the second quarter alone truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 lastly i want to thank our teammates who dedicated more than hours during the second quarter to volunteer in their communities im really proud of the good work our company and our teammates are doing to live out our purpose and they make a difference in the lives of their clients teammates and communities so lets turn to the second quarter performance highlights on slide second quarter results were mixed overall net income available to common in the second quarter was billion or a share eps decreased relative to the yearago quarter primarily due to a higher loan loss provision and noninterest expense partially offset by higher net interest income eps decreased sequentially as higher funding cost pressured net interest income total revenue decreased sequentially consistent with our revised guidance and a decrease in net interest income was partially offset by increase in fee income led by record results at truist insurance holdings adjusted expenses were within our existing guidance range although were actively working to manage cost even more intensely loan balances were relatively stable and were pleased with the initial progress weve made to reposition the balance sheet for higherreturn core assets especially in consumer but theres always additional work to do average deposits were down largely due to client activity in march though overall deposit trends have stabilized significantly since that timeframe and our conversations with our clients and pipelines have improved were also prudently increasing our provision and allowance due to increased economic uncertainty at the same time our cet1 capital ratio increased basis points driven by organic capital generation and the sale of a stake in our insurance business these same factors drove a increase in tangible book value per share on march our insurance capital buffer increased from basis points to basis points higher than we think our steady state business model warrants but still a good performance as truist had the fourth lowest loan loss rate among traditional banks that participated in the stress test reflecting again our conservative credit culture and diverse loan portfolio we also announced plans to maintain our strong quarterly common stock dividend at a share subject to board approval strategically we continue to optimize our franchise and focus our resources on our core clients and businesses which is why we made the strategic decision to sell a billion noncore student loan portfolio at net carrying value which has no upfront pl impact were also making solid progress towards shifting our loan mix towards higherreturn core assets as we adapt to the current environment were highly focused on doubling down on our core franchise simplifying where it makes sense rationalizing our expenses and building capital all of which well address later in the presentation moving to the digital and technology update on slide digital engagement trends remain positive reinforcing the importance of continued investment in digital due to its close association with relationship primacy client experience and account growth as a proof point we recently enhanced our digital onboarding experience through a series of platform enhancements resulting in higher conversion rates for new applications faster funding and higher average digital truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 account balances our growing mobile app user base is also driving increased transaction volumes digital transactions grew sequentially and now account for of total bank transactions zelle transactions increased compared to the first quarter and now account for onethird of all digital transactions at truist which underscores the importance our clients place on our payments and money movement capabilities retail digital client satisfaction scores have also returned to their premerger highs were proud of our third place ranking in the javelin mobile banking scorecard from an overall client experience and technology perspective we continue to enhance our capability set that includes recent improvements to our cloudbased selfservice digital assistant truist assist since implementing these enhancements several months ago truist assist has hosted over conversations with more than clients and has connected clients to live agents to support more than complex needs via live chat over time increased utilization of truist assist should lead to lower volumes in our call centers were also delivering on our commitment to t3 due to launch of our truist insights to our small business heroes earlier in this month truist insights empowers small businesses by providing actionable insights about financial activities including cash flows income and expense and proactive balance monitoring we first piloted truist insights in and this year alone have generated over million financial insights for more than million clients and were now delivering best valuable tool to small business this is just one more way were bringing touch and technology together to build trust and help our small business clients bank with confidence where and how they want overall im highly optimistic that our investments and innovation in digital and technology will enhance performance and further improve the client experience let me turn to loans and leases on slide loan growth continues to be correlated with the solid progress weve made to shift our loan mix towards more profitable portfolios and core clients while intentionally pulling back from lower yielding and certain single product relationships average loan balances were stable sequentially as growth in our commercial portfolio was largely offset by lower consumer balances commercial loan growth was driven by seasonality and mortgage warehouse lending and continued growth in traditional ci which is a core area for us the decline in average consumer balances was primarily due to indirect auto where weve intentionally reduced production home equity residential mortgage and student loan balances also declined and ill provide more details about the sale of the student loan portfolio in a few moments at the same time were seeing strong results from our service finance and sheffield businesses where second quarter production grew and respectively from the yearago quarter service finance continues to perform very well and take market share and consistent with our balance sheet optimization well increase our loan sale opportunities to help support its growth as i mentioned we made the strategic decision to sell our billion noncore student loan portfolio which had been running off at a pace of approximately million per quarter we sold the student loan book in late june at net carrying value with no upfront pl impact proceeds from the sale were used to reduce other wholesale funding the transaction will modestly hurt nii but boost nim and balance sheet efficiency exactly what we should be doing in an environment where cost of capital and funding has increased meaningfully truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 going forward well continue to better focus our balance sheet on truist clients who have broader relationships while limiting our exposure to single product and indirect clients as well as evaluate ways to increase the velocity overall of our balance sheet now let me provide some perspective on overall deposit trends on slide average deposits decreased billion or primarily due to seasonal tax payments and outflows that occurred late in the first quarter and were consistent with industry impacts of quantitative tightening we continue to experience remixing within our deposit portfolio as noninterestbearing deposits decreased to of total deposits from in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter of interestbearing deposit costs increased basis points sequentially and our cumulative interestbearing deposit beta was up from in the first quarter due to the continued presence of higher rate alternatives and the ongoing shift from noninterest bearing accounts to higheryielding products we continue to ph make a balanced approach in the current environment being attentive to client needs and relationships while also striving to maximize value outside of rate pay our continued rollout of truist one and ongoing investments in treasury and payments are the bulls eye of our sharpened strategic focus and will remain critical as we look to acquire new relationships deepen existing ones and maximize highquality deposit growth now let me turn it over to mike to discuss our financial results in a little more detail michael b maguire chief financial officer truist financial corp great thank you bill and good morning everybody ill begin with net interest income on slide for the quarter taxable equivalent net interest income decreased sequentially as higher funding costs more than offset the benefits of higher rates on earning assets reported net interest margin decreased basis points to due primarily to an acceleration of interestbearing deposit betas and mix shift out of dda into other high cost alternatives the lower net interest margin also reflected our liquidity build late in the first quarter while liquidity remained elevated throughout april and may it has normalized by june and will provide some modest boost in nim going forward on a yearoveryear basis net interest income is still up and core net interest margin is up basis points this reflects the cumulative benefit weve seen from the rising rates during the cycle particularly throughout but now we are losing some of that benefit in moving to fee income on slide fee income rebounded relative to the first quarter insurance income increased million sequentially to a record million demonstrating the strength of truist insurance holdings yearoveryear organic revenue grew by the highest in four quarters driven by strong new business growth improved retention and a favorable pricing backdrop other income increased million primarily due to higher income from our nonqualified plan and higher other investment income in contrast investment banking and trading income decreased million reflecting lower bond originations loan syndications and asset securitizations as well as lower core trading income from derivatives and credit trading finally mortgage banking income decreased million with most of the decrease related to priorquarter gain on sale of a servicing portfolio truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 turning to noninterest expense on slide adjusted noninterest expense increased million or sequentially the increase in adjusted expenses reflected a million increase in personnel costs due to higher variable compensation and nonqualified plan expense and a million increase in professional fees associated with enterprise technology and other investments these increases were partially offset by a million reduction and other expenses due to lower operational losses during the quarter as a company we have substantial opportunities to operate more efficiently and are committed to generating expense reductions on the april earnings call we discussed a strategic realignment within our fixed income sales and trading business in which we discontinued certain marketmaking activities and services provided by middle market fixed income platforms that had an unattractive roe we also identified various expense reduction activities that had already been underway including realigning our lightstream platform to our broader consumer business and ongoing capacity adjustments to marketsensitive businesses such as mortgage were actively working to identify and accelerate additional actions that could be implemented over the course of the next to months to generate cost reductions to reflect efficiency opportunities and changing conditions these actions include taking a much more aggressive approach towards fte management realigning and consolidating businesses to advance our longterm strategy rationalizing our tech spend to drive more efficient and effective delivery and optimizing our operations and contact centers which will help us transform truist into a more effective and efficient company taken together we believe these actions will increase our focus double down on our core simplify our business bend the expense curve and enhance returns for our shareholders moving to slide asset quality metrics reflected continued normalization during the second quarter nonperforming loans rose basis points primarily due to increases in our cre and ci portfolios though they remain manageable at basis points while the increase in cre nonperforming loans include some office these loans are generally paying as agreed our net chargeoff ratio was basis points inclusive of a 12basis point impact from the sale of the student loan portfolio excluding this student loan sale net chargeoffs were basis points up basis points sequentially wed also note that the student loan sale had no impact on our provision expense this quarter as the chargeoff taken in conjunction with the sale was essentially equal to the allowance on the portfolio during the quarter we also increased our alll ratio basis points to due to greater economic uncertainty consistent with our commentary last quarter weve tightened credit and reduced our risk appetite in select areas though we maintain our throughthecycle approach for highquality longterm clients next ill provide more details on our cre portfolio which takes us to slide on june cre including commercial construction represented of loans held for investment while the office segment comprised only we maintain a highquality cre portfolio through disciplined risk management and prudent client selection we typically work with developers and sponsors we know well and have observed their performance through multiple cycles our larger exposures tend to be associated with sponsors that has strong institutional ownership and we have actively managed less strategic exposures out of the portfolios since the close of the merger looking at office in particular the chart at the lower right provides a breakdown of our office portfolio by tenant and class our office exposure tends to be weighted towards multitenant class a properties that are situated within our footprint all factors that we believe will drive outperformance in addition we have a strong cre team that is highly proactive in working with clients to get ahead of the problems during the second quarter we completed a thorough review of the majority of our cre office exposure we considered current conditions and client support in our risk rating approach as a result a handful of loans truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 were moved to nonaccrual though the preponderance of the clients in exposure are paying as agreed we believe our actions are prudent in light of current market dynamics and demonstrate our commitment to proactive and early identification and resolution of credit risk while problem loans have increased in recent months we believe overall issues will be manageable in light of our lighter maturity profile conservative ltvs and reserves which for office totaled of loans held for investment turning to capital on slide as you can see from the capital waterfall truist is wellcapitalized and has significant flexibility to respond to potential changes in the risk and regulatory environment beginning on the left cet1 capital increased basis points to at june this was driven by organic capital generation and the completion of the sale of the stake in truist insurance holdings i would also point out that at were well above our new regulatory minimum of which takes effect on october we expect to achieve an approximate cet1 ratio by yearend through a combination of organic capital generation and disciplined management of rwa growth this view does contemplate the headwind from the pending fdic assessment on top of this truist has more than basis points of additional flexibility given the residual ownership stake in truist insurance holdings as we look beyond we do expect regulatory and capital requirements to become more stringent and potentially require us to deduct aoci from our cet1 ratio while the final form of any regulatory changes remains to be seen truist is wellpositioned to respond due to our strong organic capital generation and the likely phase in periods of any potential new requirement specifically and as shown on the righthand side of the slide based on estimated cash flows and assuming todays forward curve we would expect truists aoci to decline by by the end of assuming our current rate of organic capital generation remains constant truist should generate sufficient capital to offset the estimated remaining impact of aoci on cet1 over this time period while maintaining the strategic capital flexibility with truist insurance holdings and now i will review our updated guidance on slide looking into the third quarter of we expect revenues to be down due to seasonally lower insurance revenue and slightly lower loan balances which will lead to continued pressure on net interest income albeit at a slower pace relative to the decline we experienced in the second quarter adjusted expenses are anticipated to decline to as seasonally lower insurance commissions and our efforts to bend the expense curve will offset several seasonal headwinds like marketing and employee benefits that should change the tailwinds in the fourth quarter for the full year we now expect revenues to increase to compared to the decline from our previous outlook for growth is primarily driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit betas slower loan growth and lower investment banking revenue adjusted expenses are expected to increase which is at the upper end of our previously guided range due to continued investments in enterprise technology and other areas this excludes the anticipated fdi fee surcharge this is a number that is higher than where weve been targeting but as weve discussed we are pursuing a number of actions to reduce costs truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 in terms of asset quality our expectation is for the net chargeoff ratio to be between and basis points which includes the impact of the student loan sale finally we expect an effective tax rate of or on a taxable equivalent basis now bill i hand it back to you for some final remarks william henry rogers chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp great thanks mike so lets conclude on slide were on the right path im highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant postintegration potential as summarized in our investment thesis our goal financially is to provide strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers our strategic pivot from integrating to operating is well underway and while the financial benefits of our pivot have been masked by the rapid increase in funding costs from related revenue pressure weve made significant strategic progress over the past year and its showing up in a number of operating metrics of our business in our consumer banking and wealth segments retail small business banking net new checking production has been positive during four past five quarters reflecting the success of truist one and improved retention associated with our increasing client service metrics truist one also has many features that appeal to millennials and gen z represent of the new client applications our welltrusted brokerage business continue to build momentum as net organic asset flows which exclude the impact of market value changes have been positive eight of the last nine quarters weve also steadily improved client satisfaction through the distinctive service provided by our branches and care agents as well as improvements to our digital processes and procedures that originated in our client journey routes as a result our client satisfaction scores were stable to improving across most of our channels during the second quarter but have been consistently rising over the past year since the integration in corporate and commercial we continue to focus on left lead loan transactions and the synergies between our cib and ccb businesses during the first half of the year of the left lead transactions closed by truist were with our ccb clients were also making inroads with new ccb clients as of the ccb left leads i just mentioned were new relationships in equity capital markets transaction economics have improved approximately basis points on average since the merger and in wholesale payments our pipelines the highest its been since the merger each of these data points reflects our increasing strategic relevance with our clients in addition our irm program integrated relationship management is off to a great start this year as weve already delivered nearly more irm solutions yeartodate than during the same period a year ago our strong progress demonstrates what is possible postintegration when our teammates can focus their undivided attention on caring for their clients and deepening those relationships however just as were shifting our focus from integrate to operate the economic landscape shifted from favorable to more challenging as a result we too must shift and make tough decisions to fit the realities of todays economic environment and tomorrows regulatory requirement this means being more disciplined about where we choose to compete and deploy our capital with our businesses clients or products and looking deeper at more structural cost opportunities that exist at truist truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 these opportunities exist but were not the primary focus during the integration period where the focus was on creating the best transition possible for clients and teammates mike highlighted many of the specifics earlier while the details are critically important what will ultimately matter to stakeholders is our absolute expense base and growth and our teams are aligned internally on changing that trajectory im really truly optimistic about the future of truist as our unwavering foundation of purpose our talented teammates leadership and growth markets and diverse business model will continue to drive our momentum and fulfill our potential so brad let me turn it back over to you for qa brad milsaps headinvestor relations truist financial corp thank you bill sharon at this time will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session as you do that id like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one followup in order that we may accommodate as many of you as possible today question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning everyone so i just wanted to follow up of course it makes sense that the funding cost since lower loan growth is part of the change in the revenue outlook just wondering as you look forward and you think about that deposit mix and deposit cost trajectory as far as funding cost looking past the second quarter how do you see that affecting the nii trajectory within that new revenue guide for third and fourth thanks guys michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah good morning ken its mike id say as we think about the rest of the year the same factors that have been driving id say just average balance qt primarily in the second quarter we had a little bit more of an impact from tax payments will continue the mixing has been pretty consistent too from a noninterestbearing demand perspective into higher cost alternatives we saw a little bit of an acceleration in the first quarter as youll recall but this quarter that stabilized a bit we were down about on those balances and remix from i guess to we would expect that trend to continue as well i think really the factors as we think about nii trajectory for the third and the fourth quarter has much more to do with sort of the fed policy track right we had about a call it close to basis points average increase in the fed funds rate in the second quarter which really did have an impact on our betas and our funding costs we would expect that to be about half that in the third quarter and further moderating from there ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 and just on the followup what do you think that means for the kind of the view of work you think terminal interest bearing beta might land michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp its tough were at today thats higher than where we expected to be i think we as recently as a month or so ago expressed an expectation that maybe mid to high would be the case i think certainly piercing but really hard to pick a number at this point ken to be honest with you a lot of it i think has to do with how long were higher for longer ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah that makes sense okay thank you operator well take our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess maybe first question mike just following up on what your response to ken around just the change in deposit beta expectation indiscernible to last month are they like when we think about what you said on deposit beta outlook are there any real signs that are suggesting that deposit trends are in fact slowing down and the likelihood of the deposit beta update you provided today is more likely to play out versus having to change this again next month im just wondering are you seeing any tangible signs on the ground that suggest things are getting better michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp we look at it on a weekly monthly basis ebrahim and so i think yeah i mean i think history would say that as we approach and reach this terminal policy rate we should start to see some moderation in the beta creep were starting to see that a little bit but a month or a few weeks a trend does not make and so just being very cautious on the outlook there i mean at ph going to the degree of rate awareness across our client set is very very high across the industry is very very high and so look and i think thats probably as much as anything driven the miss on betas for the sector so far ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess a specific question youve talked a lot both you and bill throughout the call around wanting to bend the cost curve and the expense focus i know youre not giving guidance today but as we think about the opportunity there im just wondering if you can put some framework around what we should expect around what this entails with regards to just quantifying it william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah ill take that and without again trying to sort of provide specific guidance because were have a lot of things that were working on if you think about sort of the buildup so the buildup was related to things that are truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 investing to build a large financial institution and then we had some unique onetime things to us that are things like pension accounting and by the way acquisitions as part of that so id say a couple of things i mean were clearly at an inflection point in the growth rate so the growth rates kind of change materially and you can sort of see that by our guidance for the year relative to where we are right now so that will give you of an impression of where we think the third and fourth quarter will be from a growth perspective and i think similarly sort of on an absolute basis for the balance of this year we would expect to see some of that absolute level of expenses coming down but the real change comes in the structural opportunities that mike talked about and the things that were working on so we can bend the curve in lots of ways that are incremental but i think the big opportunity for us is sort of the fundamental components in terms of how our company is structured to how it runs what the chassis looks like what are the businesses that were in and thats the work that were doing thats the big work of post integration to running the company in a way that reflects the current environment so what i would say maybe ill use the word appreciably so expenses will be down appreciably and as we get into this latter part of this year well provide a lot more guidance about ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thanks a lot appreciate it operator for our next question well turn to erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning and i apologize in advance that it feels like everyones asking the same question but i think its important for your investors to have clarity mike just on the net interest income trajectory i apologize that were asking you to spoonfeed it to us and for everybody to model it later but investors are really thinking about what the exit rates for the fourth quarter will be potentially overlay your net interest income sensitivity that you disclosed in your 10q which at down ph basis points just down basis points would imply pretty good stability from fourth quarter level so i guess im wondering from the what is the range of nii outcomes that you expect for the fourth quarter and do you agree with that notion that if the fed does cut basis points which a lot of investors are putting in their models there is going to be relative stability in terms of your net interest income power next year michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah no erika i dont mind at all the followup question here so a couple things yes i mean look we are according to our nii sensitivity disclosure relatively neutral and id say based on where we are in the cycle and how in particular betas are performing were probably even a little bit more liability sensitive to that than that and you see that in our results were not currently contemplating a cut this year and when we talked about our expectations in the middle of june we were thinking about a cut as early as this year weve updated our rate view to a up ph basis points at the next meeting and then holding until probably mid2024 so that probably is whats influencing our revenue guide for the rest of this year and especially the nii component but yeah i mean just to get to your truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 question if we saw a down ph basis points that would absolutely be a stabilizing force and would be a nice tailwind for our nii based on how were positioned erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and within your guide go ahead bill william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah erika let me just add a couple things because were really talking about sort of betas and nii and we also need to shift to talk about client and client activity which is also an important part of this so the tailwind that were creating about netnet deposit growth expansion irm primacy with relationships and then on the pricing side i mean were starting to see some of that pricing flexibility particularly on the commercial side so spread over sofr probably 20someplus basis points quartertoquarter so the ability to be more relevant to our clients reposition our portfolio to reflect that be in the higher returning quite frankly taking some market share where others are backing off were leaning into some opportunities that have greater return for us so in addition to all the betas and the other components theres just a lot of really good underlying client activity thats tailwind erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just a followup question and then ill step aside mike i guess let me ask this a different way within the down or up to in terms of adjusted revenue what is the nii outlook embedded there michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah yeah no problems so our expectation is that in the third quarter with a single rate hike well continue on a downward trajectory but at a much more moderate pace call it half of what we saw in the second quarter and i think you would expect the pressure to decline even further in the fourth quarter erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc perfect thank you michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp talking about nii yeah you got it operator our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thanks so much just one quick followon to this discussion regarding the noninterestbearing component i know you mentioned earlier that you expect the noninterestbearing to remix to stabilize here and im just truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 wondering in your nii outlook where youre expecting noninterestbearing to trend and where do you feel that that will stabilize thanks michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp its been remixing at about a quarter for us that was about billion on average balance and in the quarter i would expect that trend to continue at that rate we spent a lot of time last quarter talking about where that might ultimately land i think theres a chance that that rate of or whatever to a quarter does begin to moderate some here bill and i both talked about sort of maybe its a mid terminal mix of dda but even that i think is in many respects an estimate and trying to rely on prepandemic and even pre back to the pre gfc proxy so betsy i dont know if that helps or not but we are assuming that dda will continue to decline in the third and the fourth quarter again the second quarter is a little tougher because of the tax payments and the likes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right got it okay thanks and then just shifting the conversation a little bit towards capital i see your slide on the significant capital momentum and flexibility that youve got maybe you could just frame for us how youre thinking about whats the right level for you as were thinking through what regulation could come through here next week supposedly were going to have some new proposals come out and then give us a sense as to buyback capacity and where youre thinking about that at this stage thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah betsy its bill so i think the position right now is we continue to build and so the targets are developing more information is coming well know more over the next days in terms of different proposals and impact on us and really what the slide was meant to do rather than show sort of an absolute level or a target was really to show the flexibility and the organic creation of capital that we have so we start from a good position of well be organically at end of this year without sort of doing anything dramatic related to riskweighted assets sort of staying on the process that were on and then we just have a lot of flexibility that the aoci sort of runs off and then we have and we just have other flexibility so well know more as it develops but i think were in the left lane of capital accretion and well stay in that mode until were not and that same thing applies to any buybacks or whatnot we sort to have to understand where the stopping point is before we make any comment about buybacks and today that would be short term not on the table as were building capital betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and appreciate the aoci burn down very helpful thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah good truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 operator well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities the floor is yours mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i want to recognize that accelerated capital path cet1 by yearend so certainly progress with capital but otherwise bill i need help in understanding how you can say youre on the right path one you had a merger and endmarket merger an endmarket merger predicated on cost synergies and here we are over three years later and your efficiency ratio in the second quarter is worse than peer second your new guide is for negative operating leverage of basis points to basis points and to boot the revenue guide was lowered by basis points than your expense guide whats the high end of your prior range your personnel expense were up quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear and then three you talked about bending the cost curve but over the past three years you mentioned when the hood was open you said lets invest more then it was investing more for growth now here you say youre investing more in enterprise tax so from the the merger is predicated on cost synergies the guidance for big negative operating leverage youre still spending more so i understand employees should be happy theyre being paid more the customers are happy you have strong relationships the communities are happy that youre immersed in them but the shareholders i think i can safely say are not happy i mean not happy about the expense growth and theyre not happy about the negative operating leverage and it just seems like i love you personally but i just wonder if you could spin a little too soft and not taking the tougher actions like some of your peers have so correct my logic or thinking or my observations if you would william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks thanks mike and i appreciate the love that you have right back at you so i think that so a couple of things one is maybe ill challenge a little bit that merger was predicated on cost saves alone remember that merger was predicated on opportunity as well and opportunity in that market so we want to make sure that were wellpositioned to take advantage of those so when i talk about sort of being on track i dont want you to think that that satisfaction about where we are from an expense side building the infrastructure for a large company in this environment was more expensive than we anticipated so theres just no doubt about that but to that point i think were at a really good inflection point and that inflection point is a pivot the intensity i can assure you here around expenses but not just expenses but just redesigning the chassis i mean there are lots of easy things you can do you can do hiring freezes and those types of things and we are underway on all that and youll start to see some of that over the next couple of quarters but our commitment is to really underchange the fundamental structure and the business model that results of this so theres certain businesses we talked about student loan would be an example that weve been supporting from an expense standpoint but just doesnt fit into our strategy and doesnt makes sense and well evaluate other parts of our business and other parts of our support structure that are part of that truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 you could argue we should have been doing that faster i think thats a legitimate push and i accept that but i dont want you to think thats its not happening and the focus is intense but it is about trying to create more permanent change than structural i mean lets make the next quarter lower lets really change the fundamental structure of the company from an expense standpoint youve seen me do it before and you know we can do it again so my confidence comes from the fact that weve got a team thats committed to this and the plans that i see and the focus that we have this is an inflection point from that standpoint in this quarter mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so you mentioned your comeback was in plan for to months and i know look i know you wanted to have positive operating leverage and the environment worked against you partly and as you acknowledged there is some other things internally but it looks like we talked to get positive operating leverage in is that something youre going to shoot for and when do we hear about this new expense planned over the next to months you gave us a longer list earlier and what sort of magnitude might that be william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah well start talking about that in the next couple of quarters mike and how they fit into the overall structure as ive said to you before we have every business unit has a positive operating leverage plan i mean thats what weve asked them to do is to create plans that are unique to their businesses but what we need to do in addition is to have sort of the enterprise positive operating leverage focus well just have to see how it plays out i mean theres a lot of economic factors that will determine that so id say not throwing in the towel so to speak but we just have to see where some of the economics lay out as it relates to that so if were in a different rate environment were in a different investment banking environment were in a different then ill have a different view on that but as i sit here today its a tough climb but what we want to do is build that capacity for the long term mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last short followup i asked this everybody the nii guide is much lower for you and for others do you think youve captured it all here i mean do you ph lead the year at that kind of fourth quarter level and thats it or do you see more downside after that michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp as far as the year is concerned look weve lifted it higher for longer the new guide reflects how betas are performing so i think we feel like weve got it for the year as far as trajectory and trough in its just i think it really is going to be rate path and policy dependent so long as were at these rates and for longer betas are going to keep creeping truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 now the good news is we are seeing and bill mentioned theres some improvement on things like credit spreads and repricing assets et cetera but i think so long as we stay at whatever or theres a risk if theres a second hike for sure mike to our outlook but no i think weve got  and  pretty wellpegged mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator our next question comes from john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp hi good morning i wanted to ask a little bit about credit could you talk a little bit about the asset quality trends you saw this quarter and what drove the increase in nonperformers particularly around ci and cre william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp john ill turn it over to clarke but just theres not a trend so a lot of idiosyncratic things but let me turn it over to clarke to go do a little more detail clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah thanks bill and thanks john so i would just say we had a number of moving pieces this quarter from a credit perspective and a lot of that was intentionality around actively managing the portfolio so the takeaways i would give you are first we had really solid consumer performance overall with lower npls and losses versus our forecast so the consumer is holding up really well so where we did see some impact to your point is in the ci and cre books from a ci standpoint we did see some uptick in npls and losses but what id tell you is more episodic theres no particular trend or segment issue as bill said and were coming off really low historical numbers and so even where we are today would be lower than our longterm numbers as far as the npl increase most of that was driven by an intentional focus on cre office so what we did is we did an intense loanbyloan review of almost our entire book so ill just give you some color on  in our community bank we looked at all office loans greater than million and in  we looked at everything over million so weve done a loanbyloan review with the vast majority of all of our cre office that included updated risk assessments in view of valuation so we worked really really hard to make sure were not kicking the can down the road and we understand where we are so as a result of that we put a few loans on nonaccrual i would tell you that the predominance of those loans are actually current theyre swap to maturity from a rate standpoint and theyve got good economic risks were trying to stay focused on their ability to exit at maturity and so were looking and making sure we fully understand that so that drove the increase in the npls and then we did recognize that with a bp increase in our allowance and so our office allocation is up ph bp in the overall so we feel really good about that truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 so again i would say the takeaway is we worked really hard to make sure we have good visibility in the portfolio and the good news is our overall guidance for losses really didnt change we included our student loan impact for  but we maintained otherwise our loss guidance for the year john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp got it and maybe just as a followup clarke what should we think about in terms of maybe the chargeoff trajectory in the back half of the year thats embedded in the guidance relative to the basis points i guess jumpingoff point here clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah again were very confident well be within the range of basis points to basis points for the entire year and i would just remind you all that the second half of the year is always seasonally high in our consumer businesses particularly in our subprime auto and so thats why you see the range stay in the basis points to basis points range so it will be higher than  but within the guidance weve given you john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thank you operator well move to our next question from john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the efficiency side of things i know i heard around the efficiency program that youre working on and looking to bend the cost curve how should we think about longterm efficiency for the company as youre looking at this program as youre looking at this quarter being the inflection and youre apparently clearly looking at it across businesses how should we think about what the prudent the appropriate efficiency ratio is and the longterm perspective that youre likely to target here thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hey john its bill ill take that what i said was obviously is that the expense growth is going to decrease materially so thats what were going to see and then the absolute expense base related to our businesses i think the way to think about it and this is very similar sort of how we came out of the merger is we should be sort of top quartile efficiency ratio so the efficiency ratio is going to be a bit determined by a little bit of the market conditions where rates are but our business model our construct things that were engaged in i think rather than sort of honing in on a specific number because i think that sort of boxes you in so to speak in terms of business mix and those type things i think really hone in on the expectation from shareholders ought to be that we ought to be sort of top quartile from an efficiency ratio given the opportunities that we have both on the revenue side and then the diversity and construct of our business mix john pancari q analyst evercore isi truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 okay thanks bill thats helpful and then on the credit side i appreciate the color you just gave around the nonaccruals can you give us your thoughts around additional reserve additions here is it likely that you still see some incremental build there and then where does the commercial real estate reserve stand right now the ratio and the theme for the office commercial real estate reserve thanks clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah john this is clarke while were comfortable with our reserve levels right now based on what we know today obviously cecls lifeofloan given what you know today obviously if the economic outlook deteriorates any further or we do see additional deterioration beyond what we believe weve seen and forecasted today around the portfolio performance or risk attributes you could see some additional incremental build but i would not expect to see any sort of large build or hockey stick type so i think it would be more incremental if we see some and then as far as i did say the cre office reserve is overall and i would remind you all we have about of our portfolio our small loans and our wealth and ccb segments which carries higher reserves so weve got i think really strong reserves against where i think the fundamental risk is in the office side and then our total cre allocation right now was ph john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thank you operator well move to our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning bill good morning mike william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc clarke you were talking about whats going on here in commercial real estate and can you give us some further color on when you look at the nonaccrual increase in commercial real estate is it because the owners of these properties are losing tenants is it more the value of the properties have fallen and therefore the loan to values are out of sync and then as part of the answer how are you guys working to resolve working with your customers to resolve these issues clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp great question gerard i would say for us we take a very strict view of accrual status when we think about whether loan needs to be on nonaccrual or not and i would just remind you what i said the majority of the loans that we place on nonaccrual this quarter in the cre office segment and ci but in the cre office segment are actually current from a contractual basis right now because they still have good economic rents theyre hedged truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 on the rate side and so theyre performing on their payments but were looking at what might happen at the end of term as the rate impactfully hits after the slots go off and whether theres any risk in leasing activity and then what it costs to for example reposition the property from an operating standpoint or structurally to be sure the loan could be resized at maturity and so thats whats driving our view of accrual status so a lot of it is the valuation side unless the sponsor or principal can address these risks the good news is were working with our sponsors we dont see our clients in anyway just walking away from the loans we have longterm relationships there and so were looking at things like asking them to refit bring in more equity give us an lc bring us some interest reserves we may do some ab note splits and as they attempt to sell the property so weve got a lot of tools in the tool chest and were working all of those our goal is to be early on this and work with as many borrowers as we can and hopefully the market will improve when well have good success william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and then not to minimize the focus doesnt mean its acute but just also remember of this portfolio is sitting in our markets so were sort of a net in migration market so while theyre dealing with current tenants people are consolidating their office space all thats happening were experiencing that with all of our bars we also have markets in which is a lot of in migration so theres also more new tenants and more opportunities and its tedious and chronic youve got to be in the right building the class a the opportunities and our portfolio arch to class a and in markets migration markets so again not to minimize it but we got we have some better opportunities from that side gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good bill yeah and just as a quick followup mike when you look at the aoci burndown what would accelerate that in terms from an interest rate standpoint the forward curve is looking for some shortterm interest rate cuts early next year what would bring that number down even faster from an interest rate standpoint what would you have to see michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp well a couple i think the positive catalyst even away from rates would be i guess in connection with rates would be speeds increasing in terms of the actual to the cash flow profile but if youre looking at the rates we would need to see the long end rally and wed actually need to see a parallel benefit from mortgage spreads as well so some of the for example rate rally you saw even from the end of the quarter to this to where we are basis points on the 10year if mortgage spreads dont come with it it can lag a bit but that would be the and gerard thanks for the question because what we try to lay out on the righthand part of that slide frankly was a pretty conservative burndown analysis based on todays speeds which are quite slow and with no benefit from seeing yield curve normalization gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator we have time for one more question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi thanks for squeezing me in just one more on cost here i guess how are you thinking about organizing the effort in terms of whos kind of taking responsibility for running it are you think about bringing in any outside consultants to get kind of a fresh perspective or talk about the organization a bit thank you william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp matt maybe at its simplest form its me in terms of sort of who is responsible but our executive leadership team and weve got a really good focus on those weve got and by the way we have different third parties helping us with different elements sort of not an uber approach because i actually think we need to own it it needs to be part of the work that we do as a leadership team but we have a variety of consultants looking on specific areas so they may be focused on a consolidation of a specific technology or an outsourcing of a particular thing so they exist as part of the process but this is an overall leadership team sleeves rolled up everybody is in it not only wind the business up but most importantly enterprise across where i think the real efficiencies are achieved and are more permanent as we think about the company matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and in terms of how you think about the timing is this going to be like a oneyear effort a several year effort a continuous improvement effort how are you thinking about that so far thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean its already underway and its a continuous improvement i mean i think the mentality of structuring the company around our strategic focus and creating a chassis that attaches to it is not a onetime thing i think thats something that were constantly doing constantly looking at again back to that commitment to sort of be top quartile in terms of how we run the company from an efficiency standpoint so thats both the revenue and the expense part that comes along with that so its not a onetime big bang thing because i actually dont think those are permanent and dont think they stick this is a philosophy of how we run the company and the approach that we take long term matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator that concludes our questionandanswer session for today ill turn the floor back over for any closing
