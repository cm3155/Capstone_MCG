issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recoup losses to the dif associated with bank failures in the first half of under the rule the assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an insured depository institutions estimated uninsured deposits reported as of december adjusted to exclude the first billion of uninsured deposits the special assessment for truist is million with million recognized in the fourth quarter of and an additional million recognized in the first quarter of due to an increase in the estimated relevant losses to the dif reported by the fdic in february the ultimate amount of expenses associated with the special assessment will also be impacted by the finalization of the losses incurred by the fdic in the resolutions of silicon valley bank and signature bank which could result in additional expense in march the fdic released proposed revisions to its statement of policy on bank merger transactions the proposal reflects regulatory legislative and industry changes since the statement of policy was last published for comment and amended makes the statement more principlesbased communicates the fdic boards expectations regarding the evaluation of merger applications filed under the bank merger act and describes the types of merger applications for which the fdic is the responsible agency we continue to evaluate the proposal and the potential impacts if adopted as proposed on the company and truist bank the frbs capital plan rule provides that a bhc must update and resubmit its capital plan if the bhc determines there has been or will be a material change in its risk profile financial condition or corporate structure since it last submitted the capital plan truist determined that the sale of our remaining

execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite truist has developed and employs a risk framework that further guides business functions in identifying measuring responding to monitoring and reporting on possible exposures to the organization truist has developed a risk taxonomy designed to drive internal risk measurement and monitoring and enable truist to clearly and transparently communicate to stakeholders the level of potential risk the company faces and the companys position on managing risk to acceptable levels truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization all teammates are responsible for upholding the companys purpose mission and values and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the companys culture the truist code of ethics guides the companys decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations risktaking activities must be evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive riskadjusted returns while preserving asset value and capital truists compensation plans are designed to consider teammates adherence to and successful implementation of truists risk values and associated policies and procedures the companys compensation structure is designed to support its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risktaking behavior market risk market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios securities or other financial instruments market risk results from changes in the level volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices including interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange rates equity and commodity prices effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truists strategic financial objectives truists most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet however market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk price risk and volatility risk in truists business units interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options inherently embedded in bank products options risk the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at truist market risk management also includes the enterprisewide ipv function interest rate market risk as a financial institution truist is exposed to interest rate risk from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet positions truist primarily monitors this risk through two measurement types i nii at risk and ii economic value of equity and manages this risk with securities derivatives and broader asset liability management activities irr measurement is reported monthly through the alco monthly irr reporting includes exposure and historical trends relative to risk limit scenarios impacts to a wide range of rate scenarios and sensitivity tests of key assumptions irr reporting is provided to the brc monthly and reviews of varying irr topics are performed quarterly irr measurement is influenced by data assumptions and models due to their high sensitivity to market rates mortgage loan and security prepayments leverage an industry model that results in varying prepayment speeds across rate scenarios prepayments for nonmortgage loans leverage a mix of dynamic models and static prepayment assumptions based on historical experience interestbearingdeposit rate paid is projected to move at a ratio deposit beta of market rates primarily the federal funds rate aligned to historical experience truist uses derivatives to hedge interest income variability of floating rate loans and to hedge valuation changes of longterm debt and investment securities truist financial corporation nii at risk measures the change in nii under alternate interest rate scenarios relative to truists baseline scenario which incorporates truists current balance sheet and offbalance sheet hedges as well as expectations for new business over the forecast horizon truists baseline scenario relies on assumptions including expectations of the economy and interest rates which are influenced by market conditions new business volume pricing and customer behavior in measuring nii at risk truist assumes that changes in key factors such as prepayments and deposit pricing betas largely move in line with those it has experienced in prior rate cycles however future behavior of key factors may vary from those used in this measurement nii at risk measurement assumes when applicable that us interest rates floor at zero and does not assume truist takes any balance sheet or hedging actions in response to the rate scenarios truist evaluates a wide range of alternate scenarios including instantaneous and gradual as well as parallel and nonparallel changes in interest rates the table below presents the estimated change to nii over the following months for select parallel alternate scenarios expressed as a percentage change relative to baseline nii table interest sensitivity simulation analysis mar dec up 200bps gradual change in interest rates up 50bps instantaneous change in interest rates down 50bps instantaneous change in interest rates down 200bps gradual change in interest rates estimated changes to nii in the table above assume no change in deposit balances or mix relative to the baseline scenario in increasing interest rate scenarios rotation from noninterestbearing into interest bearing deposits would reduce nii conversely in decreasing interest rate scenarios rotation from higher yielding to lower yielding deposits would benefit net interest income truist performs and monitors sensitivity tests of deposit and other key assumptions used in nii risk including asset prepayment speeds new loan volume pricing spreads interestbearing deposit betas noninterestbearing demand deposit balance runoff replaced by market funding eve measures changes in the economic value of truists current balance sheet and offbalance sheet hedges under alternate rate scenarios relative to starting economic value truist uses eve as a longerterm measure of interest rate risk truist performs and monitors sensitivity tests of key assumptions used in eve including asset prepayment speeds mortgage spreads mortgage loan and security valuations interestbearing deposit beta deposit runoff decay key assumption tests are generally performed by increasing and decreasing the assumption whether static or dynamically modeled relative to their respective starting values and then measuring the resulting impact to nii and eve under baseline and alternate rate scenarios the identification and testing of key assumptions are influenced by market conditions and management views of key risks the results of key assumption sensitivity tests are reported to alco and brc monthly the inventory of key assumptions and their associated sensitivity tests are reviewed with alco and brc at least annually market risk from trading activities as a financial intermediary truist provides its clients access to derivatives foreign exchange and securities markets which generate market risks trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach which includes measuring risk using var stress testing and sensitivity analysis risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level truist is also subject to riskbased capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule truist financial corporation covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities specifically those held for the purpose of shortterm resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected shortterm price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits truists trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the companys clients as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity the trading portfolio measured in terms of var consists primarily of four subportfolios of covered positions i credit trading ii fixed income securities iii interest rate derivatives and iv equity derivatives as a market maker across different asset classes truists trading portfolio also contains other subportfolios including foreign exchange loan trading and commodity derivatives however these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures valuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions additionally these positions are subject to independent price verification see note derivative financial instruments note fair value disclosures and critical accounting policies herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies securitizations as of march the aggregate market value of onbalance sheet securitization positions subject to the market risk rule which were nonagency asset backed securities positions was million consistent with the market risk rule requirements the company performs prepurchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including but not limited to deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets that materially affect valuation and performance securitization positions are subject to truists comprehensive risk management framework which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits there were no offbalance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of march varbased measures var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions for risk management purposes the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a oneday holding period at a onetail confidence level for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a 10day holding period and a confidence level due to inherent limitations of the var methodology such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing scenario analysis and stop loss limits the trading portfolios var profile is influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual subportfolios because under normal market conditions risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories the following table summarizes certain varbased measures for the three months ended march and table

another component of market risk capital is calculated using the same internal models as used for the varbased measure stressed var is calculated over a tenday holding period at a onetail confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelvemonth historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for the companys trading portfolio the following table summarizes stressed varbased measures table stressed varbased measures day holding period three months ended march  in millions maximum average minimum periodend compared to the same period of prior year both var and stressed var measures were generally higher primarily due to higher market making inventory in specific risk measures specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements eg default or event risks the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a modelbased approach subject to regulatory approval truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital as such incremental risk capital requirements do not apply var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses excluding fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading from covered positions with the corresponding daily varbased measures generated by the model as illustrated in the following graph there were no companywide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended march the total number of companywide var backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the varbased capital requirement under the market risk rule the capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four depending on the number of exceptions all companywide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance there was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months truist financial corporation model risk oversight mro is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models the validation activities are conducted in accordance with mro policy which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness ongoing monitoring and outcomes analysis as part of ongoing monitoring efforts the performance of all trading risk models is reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets assess evolving modeling approaches and identify potential model enhancement stress testing the company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme but plausible stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses stress tests include simulations for risk factor sensitivities historical repeats and hypothetical scenarios with varying liquidity horizons of key risk factors all trading positions within each applicable market risk category interest rate risk equity risk foreign exchange rate risk credit spread risk and commodity price risk are included in the companys comprehensive stress testing framework management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates as necessary to capture both current and emerging risks management also utilizes stress analyses to support the companys capital adequacy assessment standards see the capital section of mda for additional discussion of capital adequacy net interest income is liability sensitive as elevated rates and quantitative tightening have led to a reduction in deposits rotation into interest bearing deposits and higher deposit betas interest rate scenarios in table assume no change in deposit mix further rotation from noninterest bearing into interest bearing deposits would increase the liability sensitivity of truists balance sheet liquidity liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs including deposit withdrawals repayment of borrowings and other liabilities and funding of loan commitments in addition to the level of liquid assets such as cash cash equivalents and afs securities other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs including access to a variety of funding sources maintaining borrowing capacity growing core deposits loan repayment and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions in considering its liquidity position management evaluates truists funding mix based on client core funding client ratesensitive funding and national markets funding in addition management evaluates exposure to ratesensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less management also measures liquidity needs against days of stressed cash outflows for truist and truist bank to promote a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities internal liquidity stress testing liquidity stress testing is conducted for truist and truist bank using a variety of institutionspecific and marketwide adverse scenarios each liquidity stress test scenario applies defined assumptions to execute sources and uses of liquidity over varying planning horizons the types of expected liquidity uses during a stressed event may include deposit attrition contractual maturities reductions in unsecured and secured funding and increased draws on unfunded commitments to mitigate liquidity outflows truist has identified sources of liquidity however access to these sources of liquidity could be affected within a stressed environment truist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cashflow needs and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements the liquidity buffer consists of unencumbered highly liquid assets and truists liquidity buffer is substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as hqla under the lcr rule contingency funding plan truist has a contingency funding plan designed to address ongoing obligations and commitments particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction this plan is designed to examine and quantify the organizations liquidity under the various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plans reliability additionally the plan provides a framework for management and other teammates to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event the plan addresses authority for activation and decision making liquidity options and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction truist financial corporation lcr and hqla the lcr rule requires that truist and truist bank maintain an amount of eligible hqla that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective calendarday period of stress eligible hqla for purposes of calculating the lcr is the amount of unencumbered hqla that satisfy operational requirements of the lcr rule truist and truist bank are subject to the category iii reduced lcr requirements truist held average weighted eligible hqla of billion and truists average lcr was for the three months ended march effective july truist became subject to final rules implementing the nsfr which require banking organizations to maintain a stable longterm funding profile in relation to their asset composition and offbalance sheet activities at march truist was compliant with this requirement sources of funds management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet truists on and offbalance sheet obligations truist funds its balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including client deposits secured and unsecured capital markets funding and shareholders equity truist banks primary source of funding is client deposits continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of truist bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested truist bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements these sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes institutional cds overnight and term federal funds markets and retail brokered cds truist bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including fhlb advances repurchase agreements and the frb discount window available investment securities could be pledged to create additional secured borrowing capacity the following table presents a summary of truist banks available secured borrowing capacity and eligible cash at the frb table selected liquidity sources dollars in millions mar dec unused borrowing capacity frb fhlb available investment securities after haircuts available secured borrowing capacity eligible cash at the frb total at march truist banks available secured borrowing capacity represented approximately times the amount of wholesale funding maturities in oneyear or less parent company the parent company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries the parent companys assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with truist bank equity investments in subsidiaries advances to subsidiaries and notes receivable from subsidiaries the principal obligations of the parent company are payments on longterm debt the main sources of funds for the parent company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries repayments of advances to subsidiaries and proceeds from the issuance of equity and longterm debt the primary uses of funds by the parent company are investments in subsidiaries advances to subsidiaries dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders repurchases of common stock and payments on and from timetotime potential repurchases or redemptions of a portion of an outstanding tranche of the longterm debt of the parent company as may be permitted by the terms of each respective series see note parent company financial information in truists annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions access to funding at the parent company is more sensitive to market disruptions therefore truist prudently manages cash levels at the parent company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments debt service common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities without the benefit of any new cash inflows truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows in determining the buffer truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends unfunded commitments to affiliates serving as a source of strength to truist bank and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets at march and december the parent company had months and months respectively of cash on hand to satisfy projected cash outflows and months and months respectively when including the payment of common stock dividends truist financial corporation credit ratings credit ratings are forwardlooking opinions of rating agencies as to the companys ability to meet its financial commitments and repay its securities and obligations in accordance with their terms of issuance credit ratings influence both borrowing costs and access to the capital markets the companys credit ratings are continuously monitored by the rating agencies and are subject to change at any time as truist seeks to maintain highquality credit ratings management meets with the major rating agencies on a regular basis to provide financial and business updates and to discuss current outlooks and trends see item risk factors in truists annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for additional information regarding factors that influence credit ratings and potential risks that could materialize in the event of downgrade in the companys credit ratings recent changes in the companys credit ratings and outlooks include on may moodys ratings downgraded truists longterm senior unsecured rating to baa1 from a3 and truist banks baseline credit assessment to a3 from a2 and longterm deposits rating to a1 from aa3 in addition truist banks shortterm deposit rating was affirmed at prime1 ratings outlooks for both truist and truist bank were changed to stable capital the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis truists principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support truists risk profile consistent with the boardapproved risk appetite provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs comply with relevant laws regulations and supervisory guidance achieve optimal credit ratings for truist and its subsidiaries remain a source of strength for its subsidiaries and provide a competitive return to shareholders riskbased capital ratios which include cet1 capital tier capital and total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and riskweighted assets truist regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the companys capital plans

reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities truists financial position and results of operations are affected by managements application of accounting policies including estimates assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position andor consolidated results of operations and related disclosures material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the acl determination of fair value for securities msrs lhfs trading loans and derivative assets and liabilities goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes and pension and postretirement benefit obligations understanding truists accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations the critical accounting policies are discussed in mda in truists annual report on form 10k for the year ended december significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in note basis of presentation in form 10k for the year ended december disclosures regarding the effects of new accounting pronouncements are included in note basis of presentation in this report there have been no other changes to the critical accounting policies during goodwill and other intangible assets effective january several business activities were realigned reflecting updates to the companys operating structure first the cbw segment was renamed csbb and the ccb segment was renamed wb second the wealth business was realigned into the wb segment from the csbb segment representing a separate reporting unit in that segment third the small business banking client segmentation was realigned into the csbb segment from the wb segment further tih was the principal legal entity of the ih segment as the operations of tih are now included in discontinued operations the company no longer presents the ih segment as one of its reportable segments following these realignments the companys three reporting units with goodwill balances were csbb wb and wealth also in conjunction with these realignments goodwill of billion was realigned to wb from csbb based on the relative fair value of csbb and wealth and goodwill of million was realigned to csbb from wb based on the relative fair value of wb and the realigned small business banking client segmentation in addition the company completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all impacted reporting units immediately prior and subsequent to the reassignments and determined that no impairment existed truist financial corporation the quantitative valuations of these reporting units for purposes of realigning goodwill use the income approach and a marketbased approach each weighted at the inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations including projections of future cash flows discount rates and applicable valuation multiples based on the comparable public company information the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of multiyear financial forecasts developed for each reporting unit by considering several inputs and assumptions such as net interest margin expected credit losses noninterest income noninterest expense and required capital the marketbased approach utilizes comparable public company information key valuation multiples and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit and guideline transactions when applicable truist also assesses the reasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units by comparison to its market capitalization over a reasonable period of time including consideration of expected acquirer expense synergies historic bank control premiums and the current market the projection of net interest margin and noninterest expense are the most significant inputs to the financial projections of the csbb wb and wealth reporting units the longterm growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was as of january based on managements assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate market risk premium beta and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit the discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit the discount rates utilized for the csbb wb and wealth reporting units as of january were and respectively the quantitative valuation of wb performed in conjunction with the goodwill realignments indicated that as of january the fair value of the wb reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by less than indicating that the goodwill of the wb reporting unit may be at risk of impairment circumstances that could negatively impact the fair value for the wb reporting unit in the future include a sustained decrease in truists stock price a decline in industry peer multiples an increase in the applicable discount rate and deterioration in the reporting units forecast the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in managements estimates and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value the valuation of the wb reporting unit as of january indicated that if the discount rate were increased less than basis points the reporting units fair value would be less than its carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment ultimately future potential changes in managements assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value additionally a reporting units carrying value could change based on market conditions change in the underlying makeup of the reporting unit or the risk profile of those reporting units which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value the company monitored events and circumstances during the period from january to march including macroeconomic and market factors industry and banking sector events truist specific performance indicators a comparison of managements forecast and assumptions to those used in its january quantitative valuations associated with the realignments of goodwill and the sensitivity of the january quantitative results to changes in assumptions as of march based on these considerations truist concluded that it was not morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of march
