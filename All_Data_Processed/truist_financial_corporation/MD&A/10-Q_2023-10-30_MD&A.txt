described below we continue to evaluate these proposals and the potential impacts if adopted as proposed on the company and truist bank in july the us banking regulators issued a proposal to revise the riskbased capital standards applicable to the company and truist bank this proposal would introduce new approaches for credit risk operational risk market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk that generally align with the approaches for these risks under the global basel accord adopted by the basel committee the proposal would introduce a new measure of riskweighted assets which would reflect the proposed new standardized approaches for credit risk operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk as well as a proposed new measure for market risk that would be based on both internal models and standardized supervisory models of market risk the proposal includes a proposed effective date of july subject to a threeyear transition period ending july over which the expanded total riskweighted assets would be phased in in august the us banking regulators proposed a rule that would require banking organizations with billion or more in total assets to comply with longterm debt requirements and clean holding company requirements that currently apply only to global systemically important banking organizations this proposal would also impose a longterm debt requirement on certain categories of insured depository institutions that are not consolidated subsidiaries of us gsibs including insured depository institutions with billion or more in total assets such as truist bank if adopted this proposal would require the company and truist bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible longterm debt amount of no less than the greatest of i of riskweighted assets ii of total leverage exposure and iii of average total consolidated assets truist bank would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible longterm debt to the company and the company would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible longterm debt externally in addition if adopted as proposed the clean holding company requirement would limit or prohibit the company from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution including for example prohibiting the company from entering into transactions that could spread losses to subsidiaries and third parties as well as limiting the amount of the companys liabilities that are not eligible longterm debt truist financial corporation in august the fdic issued a proposal to amend its rules requiring covered insured depository institutions including truist bank to periodically submit resolution plans to the fdic if adopted as proposed truist bank would be required to submit a full resolution plan to the fdic every two years and submit an interim supplement in each year that it is not required to submit a full resolution plan in addition this proposal would increase the content requirements for plan submissions and introduce a new credibility standard for the fdics evaluation of resolution plans which would be enforceable against the covered insured depository institutions separately the frb and fdic also proposed updated guidance on resolution planning requirements applicable to the company under section 165d of the doddfrank act in addition the fdic proposed a special assessment to

processes and systems to identify measure monitor manage and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities effective risk management involves optimizing risk and return while operating in a safe and sound manner and promoting compliance with applicable laws and regulations the companys risk management framework promotes the execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite truist has developed and employs a risk framework that further guides business functions in identifying measuring responding to monitoring and reporting on possible exposures to the organization the risk taxonomy drives internal risk measurement and monitoring and enables truist to clearly and transparently communicate to stakeholders the level of potential risk the company faces and the companys position on managing risk to acceptable levels truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization all teammates are responsible for upholding the companys purpose mission and values and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the companys culture the truist code of ethics guides the companys decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations risktaking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive riskadjusted returns while preserving asset value and capital truists compensation plans are designed to consider teammates adherence to and successful implementation of truists risk values and associated policies and procedures the companys compensation structure supports its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risktaking behavior refer to truists annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for additional disclosures under the section titled risk management market risk market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios securities or other financial instruments market risk results from changes in the level volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices including interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange rates equity and commodity prices truist financial corporation effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truists strategic financial objectives truists most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet however market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk price risk and volatility risk in truists business units interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options inherently embedded in bank products options risk the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at truist market risk management also includes the enterprisewide ipv function interest rate market risk as a financial institution truist is exposed to interest rate risk from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet positions to keep net interest margin as stable as possible truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities taking into account the volumes maturities and mix truist primarily uses two methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk i simulations of possible changes to net interest income based on instantaneous and gradual changes in interest rates and ii analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates the companys simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to truists assets and liabilities the model also considers truists current and prospective liquidity position current balance sheet volumes projected growth andor contractions accessibility of funds for shortterm needs and capital maintenance deposit betas the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process truist applies deposit beta assumptions to nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity truist applies an average deposit beta of approximately to its interestbearing accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity which is consistent with truists longterm expectations truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables including noninterestbearing deposits to determine the impact these variables could have on the companys interest rate risk position the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below table interest sensitivity simulation analysis interest rate scenario annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income gradual change in prime rate bps prime rate sep sep sep sep up up no change down down net interest income is liability sensitive as elevated rates and quantitative tightening have led to a reduction in deposits rotation into interest bearing deposits and higher deposit betas interest rate scenarios in table assume no change in deposit mix further rotation from noninterest bearing into interest bearing deposits would increase the liability sensitivity of truists balance sheet management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix the following table shows the results of truists interestrate sensitivity position assuming the loss of additional demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits versus current projections under various interest rate scenarios for purposes of this analysis truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at truist financial corporation table deposit mix sensitivity analysis gradual change in rates bps base scenario at september results assuming a decrease in noninterestbearing demand deposits billion billion up up the base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at september as presented in the preceding table truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities commercial loans msrs mortgage banking operations longterm debt and other funding sources truist has utilized derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities as of september truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling billion see note derivative financial instruments for additional disclosures in the third quarter of there was a billion decrease in notional amounts on derivatives with central clearing parties as a result of conversion from libor to sofr the decline in notional is due to the maturity of shortterm libor swaps entered into in the second quarter of to maintain libor cashflows until the phase out of the libor reference rate on june 30th all remaining shortterm impacts of the conversion are expected to mature in the fourth quarter of libor transition the remaining tenors of us dollar libor ceased publication on june truist provided timely notices and information to impacted clients about the transition to new interest rates post cessation most contracts were transitioned to new rates in july and august a small number of contracts utilize longer tenor libor rates and will transition by late 3month libor or early 6month and 12month libor based on contractual agreements truist has materially completed libor transition efforts primarily utilizing sofr replacement rates and closed formal project efforts as of september fallback language used to remediate loan agreements was generally consistent with arrc recommendations and included use of hardwired fallback language which transitioned loans to a sofr based rate after june for contracts remaining without fallback language truist leveraged the libor act and corresponding safe harbor provision to transition these loans to sofr truists adjustablerate mortgage products had consistent and adequate fallback language to transition to sofr based on lender discretion and as supported by the libor act therefore these contracts did not require remediation for many consumer lending portfolios libor transitioned to the sofr rate specified in the libor act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the frb and benefit from the safe harbor provisions of the libor act derivatives that reference libor transitioned to a sofrbased replacement rate as set forth in the isda protocol addressing libor fallbacks between the company and its counterparties which have adhered to the protocol through bilateral amendments between the company and each of its counterparties or as established under the libor act and rules promulgated thereunder by the frb fallback language used to remediate libor based derivatives was generally consistent with isda publications the companys preferred securities and the companys and truist banks floating rate notes that reference libor transitioned to a sofr based rate utilizing application of the libor act and the rules promulgated

foreign exchange and securities markets which generate market risks trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach which includes measuring risk using var stress testing and sensitivity analysis risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with truists risk appetite truist is also subject to riskbased capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities specifically those held for the purpose of shortterm resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected shortterm price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits truists trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the companys clients as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity the trading portfolio measured in terms of var consists primarily of four subportfolios of covered positions i credit trading ii fixed income securities iii interest rate derivatives and iv equity derivatives as a market maker across different asset classes truists trading portfolio also contains other subportfolios including foreign exchange loan trading and commodity derivatives however these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures valuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions additionally these positions are subject to independent price verification see note derivative financial instruments note fair value disclosures and critical accounting policies herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies securitizations as of september the aggregate market value of onbalance sheet securitization positions subject to the market risk rule was million all of which were nonagency asset backed securities positions consistent with the market risk rule requirements the company performs prepurchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including but not limited to deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets that materially affect valuation and performance securitization positions are subject to truists comprehensive risk management framework which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits there were no offbalance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of september varbased measures var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions for risk management purposes the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a oneday holding period at a onetail confidence level for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a 10day holding period and a confidence level due to inherent limitations of the var methodology such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing scenario analysis and stop loss limits the trading portfolios var profile is influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual subportfolios because under normal market conditions risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories the following table summarizes certain varbased measures for the three months and nine months ended september and average one and tenday var measures for the three

in specific risk measures specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements eg default or event risks the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a modelbased approach subject to regulatory approval truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital as such incremental risk capital requirements do not apply var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses excluding fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading from covered positions with the corresponding daily varbased measures generated by the model as illustrated in the following graph there were no companywide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended september the total number of companywide var backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the varbased capital requirement under the market risk rule the capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four depending on the number of exceptions all companywide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance there was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months truist financial corporation model risk

policy which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness ongoing monitoring and outcomes analysis as part of ongoing monitoring efforts the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets assess evolving modeling approaches and identify potential model enhancement stress testing the company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme but plausible stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks all trading positions within each applicable market risk category interest rate risk equity risk foreign exchange rate risk credit spread risk and commodity price risk are included in the companys comprehensive stress testing framework management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates as necessary which is intended to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately management also utilizes stress analyses to support the companys capital adequacy assessment standards see the capital section of mda for additional discussion of capital adequacy liquidity liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs including deposit withdrawals repayment of borrowings and other liabilities and

unencumbered securities truist financial corporation internal liquidity stress testing liquidity stress testing is designed to ensure that truist and truist bank have sufficient liquidity for a variety of institutionspecific and marketwide adverse scenarios each liquidity stress test scenario applies defined assumptions to execute sources and uses of liquidity over varying planning horizons the types of expected liquidity uses during a stressed event may include deposit attrition contractual maturities reductions in unsecured and secured funding and increased draws on unfunded commitments to mitigate liquidity outflows truist has identified sources of liquidity however access to these sources of liquidity could be affected within a stressed environment truist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cashflow needs and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements the liquidity buffer consists of unencumbered highly liquid assets and truists liquidity buffer is substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as hqla under the lcr rule contingency funding plan truist has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction this plan is designed to examine and quantify the organizations liquidity under the various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plans reliability additionally the plan provides a framework for management and other teammates to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event the plan addresses authority for activation and decision making liquidity options and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction lcr and hqla the lcr rule requires that truist and truist bank maintain an amount of eligible hqla that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective calendarday period of stress eligible hqla for purposes of calculating the lcr is the amount of

deposits secured and unsecured capital markets funding and shareholders equity truist banks primary source of funding is client deposits continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of truist bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested truist bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements these sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes institutional cds overnight and term federal funds markets and retail

carrying value during the third quarter of the company observed continuing declines in its financial forecasts for its cbw and ccb reporting units the company considered such declines in the context of industry related factors including a decline in bank share prices concluding that a triggering event had occurred for its cbw and ccb reporting units and therefore truist performed a quantitative test for these reporting units as of august truist also elected to perform a quantitative test for the ih reporting unit concurrent with the other units the quantitative impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting units using the income approach weighted and two market based approaches the guideline public company weighted and guideline transaction weighted methods the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis the guideline public company approach utilizes comparable public company information key valuation multiples and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit and guideline transactions when applicable the guideline transaction method uses market observable transaction multiples for nonregulatory assisted transactions occurring within the past months which inherently incorporate a premium associated with the benefits of obtaining control the inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations including projections of future cash flows discount rates applicable valuation multiples based on the comparable public company information and guideline transaction information truist also assesses the reasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units by comparison to its market capitalization over a reasonable period of time including consideration of expected acquirer expense synergies historic bank control premiums and the current market multiyear financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several inputs and assumptions such as net interest margin expected credit losses noninterest income noninterest expense and required capital the projection of net interest margin and noninterest expense are the most significant inputs to the financial projections of the cbw and ccb reporting units the longterm growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was as of august based on managements assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate market risk premium beta and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit the discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit the discount rates utilized for the cbw ccb and ih reporting units as of august were and respectively truist financial corporation based on the companys interim impairment test of goodwill it was determined for the cbw ccb and ih reporting units that the respective reporting units fair value was in excess of its respective carrying value as of august however for the cbw and ccb reporting units the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by less than indicating that the goodwill of these reporting units may be at risk of impairment circumstances that could negatively impact the fair value for the cbw and ccb reporting units in the future include sustained decrease in truist stock price continued decline in industry peer multiples an increase in the applicable discount rate and further deterioration in the reporting units forecasts the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in managements estimates and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value the company performs sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values the analysis of the cbw and ccb reporting unit at august indicated that if the discount rates were increased basis points and basis points respectively the reporting units fair value would be less than its carrying value resulting in goodwill impairment ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value additionally a reporting units carrying value could change based on market conditions change in the underlying makeup of the reporting unit or the risk profile of those reporting units which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value the company monitored events and circumstances during the period from august through september including macroeconomic and market factors industry and banking sector events truist specific performance indicators a comparison of managements forecast and assumptions to those used in its august quantitative impairment test and the sensitivity of the august quantitative test results to changes in assumptions through september based on these considerations management concluded that it was not morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of september
