competition from new and existing market participants truists subsidiaries compete actively with national regional and local financial services providers including banks thrifts securities dealers mortgage bankers finance companies financial technology companies and insurance companies the ability of nonbanking entities including financial technology companies to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has increased competition nonbanking entities are not subject to the same regulatory framework as banks and bhcs and therefore can often operate with greater flexibility and lower costs in addition the ability to access and use technology is an increasingly significant competitive factor in the financial services industry having the right technology is a critically important component to client satisfaction because it affects the companys ability to deliver the products and services that clients desire in a manner that they find convenient and attractive

ability to make distributions to shareholders truist and its subsidiaries are also subject to supervision and examination by multiple regulators banking and other financial services statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies in addition to laws and regulations state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to truist and its subsidiaries any change in the statutes regulations or regulatory policies applicable to truist including changes in their interpretation or implementation could have a material effect on its business or organization the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which truist is subject have increased in recent years initially in response to the financial crisis and more recently in light of other factors including technological factors market changes climate as well as increased scrutiny and possible denials of bank mergers and acquisitions by federal bank regulators regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector truist expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision the descriptions below summarize certain significant federal and state laws to which truist is subject these descriptions do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statues or regulatory provisions truist financial corporation general as a bhc truist is subject to regulation under the bhca and to regulation examination and supervision by the frb truist bank a north carolina statechartered commercial bank that is not a member of the federal reserve system is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the nccob and the fdic truist bank and its affiliates are also

examination by other federal and state regulatory agencies and other regulatory authorities including the sec cftc finra and the nyse truist bank is also subject to additional state and federal laws as well as various compliance regulations that govern its activities the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower examinations by truists regulators consider not only compliance with applicable laws regulations and supervisory policies of the agency but also capital levels asset quality risk management effectiveness the ability and performance of management and the board of directors the effectiveness of internal controls earnings liquidity and various other factors following those examinations truist and truist bank are assigned supervisory ratings this supervisory framework including the examination reports and supervisory ratings which are considered confidential supervisory information could materially impact the conduct growth and profitability of truists operations under the frbs large financial institution rating system component ratings are assigned for capital planning liquidity risk management and governance and controls to be considered well managed under this rating system a firm must be rated broadly meets expectations or conditionally meets expectations for each of its three component ratings the results of examinations by any of truists federal bank regulators potentially can result in the imposition of significant limitations on truists activities and growth these regulatory agencies generally have broad enforcement authority and discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity including the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements against a regulated entity where the relevant agency determines that the operations of the regulated entity or any of its subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations are conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner or represent an unfair or deceptive act or practice fhc regulation truist has elected to be treated as a fhc which allows it to engage in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permissible for a bhc including activities that are financial in nature or incidental thereto such as securities underwriting or merchant banking while fhcs may engage in certain acquisitions without prior approval of the frb any acquisition over billion in assets would require prior approval by the frb in order to maintain its status as a fhc truist and its affiliated idi must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged and truist bank must have at least a satisfactory cra rating if the frb determines that a fhc is not wellcapitalized or wellmanaged the frb may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the fhc and may place limitations on its ability to conduct certain business activities that fhcs are generally permitted to conduct and its ability to make certain acquisitions if the failure to meet these standards persists a fhc may be required to divest its idi subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bhcs that are not fhcs furthermore if an idi subsidiary of a fhc has not maintained a satisfactory cra rating the fhc would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities although the fhc would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities longstanding federal regulations require a fhc to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks in times of severe financial stress the obligation to serve as a source of strength could cause truist to commit significant resources to supporting truist bank that otherwise would be available to truists creditors and shareholders enhanced prudential standards and regulatory tailoring rules certain us bhcs including truist are subject to enhanced prudential standards as such truist is subject to more stringent liquidity and capital requirements leverage limits stress testing resolution planning and risk management standards than those applicable to smaller institutions certain larger banking organizations are subject to additional enhanced prudential standards truist became subject to the frbs singlecounterparty credit limit rule as of july and is subject to a limit of of tier capital for aggregate net credit exposures including exposure resulting from among other transactions extensions of credit repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions investments in securities and derivative transactions to any other unaffiliated

less than billion in total consolidated assets and less than billion in certain riskrelated exposures truist financial corporation resolution planning as a category iii banking organization truist is required to submit a resolution plan every three years later resolution plans under this rule will alternate between full resolution plans and targeted resolution plans the frb and the fdic must review and evaluate truists resolution plan the frb and fdic are authorized to impose restrictions on growth and activities or operations if the agencies determine that a resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate a rapid and orderly resolution of the company under the us bankruptcy code and could require the banking organization to divest assets or take other actions if it did not submit an acceptable resolution plan within two years after any such restrictions were imposed truist submitted its inaugural resolution plan to the frb and fdic in september which is currently under review in addition truist bank is required by an fdic regulation to file a separate bank level resolution plan although that requirement has been paused since the fdic issued a policy statement in june announcing that it will resume requiring bank level resolution plans for large banks including truist bank and that such banklevel resolution plans will have more streamlined content requirements than previous requirements truist bank will be required to submit a banklevel resolution plan every three years during truist bank was informed by the fdic that its next resolution plan will be due on or before december the fdic also clarified the content requirements of the next resolution plan that truist bank is required to submit capital requirements truist and truist bank are subject to certain riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements established by the frb for truist and by the fdic for truist bank these requirements are based on the capital framework developed by the bcbs for strengthening the regulation supervision and risk management of banks under basel iii rules as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act these quantitative calculations are minimums and the frb and fdic may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner failure to be well capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have an adverse material effect on truists operations or financial condition these actions could include requiring truist commit capital to truist bank in abnormal operating conditions which would otherwise be available to truists creditors and shareholders failure to be well capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on truists or truist banks ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval for acquisitions in october the federal banking regulators adopted rules that revised the criteria for determining the applicability of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements for large us banking organizations including truist and truist bank and that tailored the application of the frbs enhanced prudential standards to large banking organizations under these rules truist and truist bank are subject to the standards applicable to category iii banking organizations under the regulatory capital rules truists and truist banks assets exposures and certain offbalance sheet items are subject to risk weights used to determine the institutions riskweighted assets these riskweighted assets are used to calculate the following minimum capital ratios for truist and truist bank cet1 riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of cet1 capital to riskweighted assets cet1 capital primarily includes common shareholders equity subject to certain regulatory adjustments and deductions including with respect to goodwill intangible assets certain deferred tax assets and aoci tier riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of tier capital to riskweighted assets tier capital is primarily comprised of cet1 capital perpetual preferred stock and certain qualifying capital instruments total riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of total capital including cet1 capital tier capital and tier capital to riskweighted assets tier capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying alll tier capital also includes among other things certain trust preferred securities truist financial corporation in march the frb adopted a final rule that integrates its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with existing regulatory capital requirements for riskbased capital requirements for certain large bhcs including truist the scb replaced the capital conservation buffer which was required to be met in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions including dividends and repurchases of any tier capital instrument such as common and qualifying preferred stock and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments the scb is equal to the greater of i the difference between truists starting and minimum projected cet1 capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test plus the sum of the dollar amount of its planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage of riskweighted assets or ii the frb assigned truist an scb of which is effective from october to september at which point a revised scb will be calculated and provided to truist although the final rule continues to require that the firm describe its planned capital distributions in its ccar capital plan truist is no longer required to seek prior approval if it makes capital distributions in excess of those included in its ccar capital plan instead truist is subject to automatic distribution limitations if its capital ratios fall below its buffer requirements which include the scb for certain large banking organizations the scb could be supplemented by a countercyclical capital buffer of up to an additional of riskweighted assets this buffer is currently set at zero an frb policy statement establishes the framework and factors the frb would use in setting and adjusting the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer covered banking organizations would generally have months after the announcement of any increase in the countercyclical capital buffer to meet the increased buffer requirement unless the frb determines to establish an earlier effective date if the full countercyclical buffer amount is implemented truist and truist bank would be required to maintain a cet1 capital ratio of at least a tier capital ratio of at least and a total capital ratio of at least to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments certain large banking organizations with trading assets and liabilities above certain thresholds including truist are subject to the market risk rule and must adjust their riskbased capital ratios to reflect the market risk of their trading activities refer to the market risk section of the mda for additional disclosures related to market risk management in addition truist and truist bank are subject to a tier leverage ratio equal to the ratio of tier capital to quarterly average assets net of goodwill certain other intangible assets and certain other deductions category iii banking organizations are also subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio the supplementary leverage ratio is calculated by dividing tier capital by total leverage exposure which takes into account onbalance sheet assets as well as certain offbalance sheet items including loan commitments and potential future exposure of derivative contracts in response to the covid19 pandemic the frb adopted a rule that temporarily changed the supplementary leverage ratio to exclude us treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the calculation of a firms leverage exposure which expired march and previously benefited truists supplementary leverage ratio by approximately basis points the frb announced plans to invite public comment on several potential supplementary leverage ratio modifications to ensure that the supplementary leverage ratio remains effective in an environment of higher reserves though such proposal has not been published as of the date of this report the frb has not yet revised the wellcapitalized standard for bhcs to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the basel iii rules for purposes of certain frb rules including determining whether a bhc meets the requirements to be a fhc bhcs such as truist must maintain a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater and a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater to meet the wellcapitalized minimum the frb may require bhcs including truist to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels depending upon general economic conditions and a bhcs particular condition risk profile and growth plans refer to the capital section in mda for disclosures containing the minimum regulatory capital ratios and wellcapitalized minimum ratios applicable to category iii banking organizations in the us banking agencies adopted a final rule that permits banking organizations that implement cecl before the end of to elect to follow the threeyear transition available under the prior rule or a new fiveyear transition to phase in the effects of cecl on regulatory capital under the fiveyear transition the banking organization would defer for two years of the dayone effect of adopting cecl and of the cumulative increase or decrease in the allowance for credit losses since adoption of cecl following the first two years the electing organization will phase out the aggregate capital effects over the next three years consistent with the transition in the original threeyear transition rule truist has elected to use the fiveyear transition to phase in the impacts of cecl on regulatory capital the us banking agencies have adopted a final rule altering the definition of eligible retained income under the final rule eligible retained income is the greater of a firms i net income for the four preceding calendar quarters net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income and ii average net income over the preceding four quarters this definition applies with respect to all of truists capital requirements truist financial corporation capital planning and stress testing requirements in addition to the regulatory capital requirements under the frbs ccar process truist must submit an annual capital plan to the frb that reflects its projected financial performance under hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios including a supervisory severely adverse scenario provided by the frb the frbs ccar framework and the doddfrank act stress testing framework also require bhcs subject to category iii standards such as truist to conduct companyrun stress tests and submit to supervisory stress tests conducted by the frb the companyrun stress tests employ stress scenarios provided by the frb and incorporate the doddfrank act capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distribution assumptions across large us bhcs in addition truist is required to conduct annual stress tests using internallydeveloped scenarios intended to stress the unique risk profile of the institution the frb

range of time horizons maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to meet projected net outflows under the bhcs 30day liquidity stress test and maintain a contingency funding plan that meets certain requirements effective july truist became subject to final rules implementing the nsfr which are designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable longterm funding profile in relation to their asset composition and offbalance sheet activities the nsfr calculated as the ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding must exceed available stable funding represents a weighted measure of a companys funding sources over a oneyear time horizon calculated by applying standardized weightings to the companys equity and liabilities based on their expected stability required stable funding is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics as a category iii banking organization truist and truist bank are subject to an nsfr requirement equal to of the full requirement payment of dividends the parent company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its

related to regulatory capital requirements general regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices and federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits surplus and available earnings certain contractual restrictions also may limit the ability of truist bank to pay dividends to the parent company no assurances can be given that truist bank will in any circumstances pay dividends to the parent company the parent companys ability to declare and pay dividends is similarly limited by federal banking law and frb regulations and policy the frb has authority to prohibit bhcs from making capital distributions if they would be deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice the frb has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bhcs to pay dividends unless a bhcs net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organizations capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition in addition the parent companys ability to make capital distributions including paying dividends and repurchasing capital securities is subject to the frbs automatic restrictions on capital distributions under the frbs capital rules truists riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements are discussed below in the capital requirements section north
