id like to turn the call over to bill william stanton demchak chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bryan and good morning everybody i hope everybody is safe and well youve seen that amidst continued uncertainty on many fronts pnc delivered solid third quarter results we grew revenue led by noninterest income which included a bounce back in consumer fees on higher volumes we managed expenses which allowed us to generate positive operating leverage of over in both the quarter and yeartodate period and our provision for credit losses was substantially less than last quarter on the flip side net interest income fell from the second quarter given the low interest rate environment and weak loan demand despite growth in customers and commitments our loans outstanding declined due to lower utilization rates including the payoff of commercial lines of credit that were drawn early in the pandemic and while we continue to experience strong deposit growth the current environment has made it more challenging to put those deposits to work while the provision and chargeoffs were down quarteronquarter nonperformers continue to rise especially in the highimpact covid areas that rob is going to discuss in a little bit more detail notwithstanding these challenges we feel that pnc is well positioned with very strong capital liquidity and loan loss reserves needless to say there are several significant upcoming events including the next round of stress tests the election and ppp forgiveness that may impact the industry and our borrowers which underscores the importance of our strong position were confident that the actions weve taken position us to both support our clients and communities and take advantage of potential investment opportunities if they arise to enhance shareholder value i want to thank our employees who despite the various challenges of the pandemic continue to execute on our strategic priorities including ongoing investments in our national expansion and digital offerings all while helping our customers navigate financial hardship and other challenges during the quarter we opened retail solution centers in nashville houston denver boston and dallas and filled out corporate teams in the recently opened seattle and portland markets in we will continue our middle market expansion into san antonio austin and san diego the ability to expose our model to these demographically attractive markets continues to generate strong returns and with that im going to turn it over to rob for a closer look at our third quarter results and then well be happy to take your questions robert q reilly chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc great thanks bill and good morning everyone as youve seen weve reported third quarter net income of billion or per diluted common share our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on an average basis on the asset side total loans declined billion to billion linkedquarter investment securities of billion increased billion or linkedquarter but on a spot basis declined billion primarily due to significant prepayment activity and maturities at quarter end our cash balances at the federal reserve averaged billion the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 compared with billion in the second quarter the increase was a result of continued deposit growth and the full quarter impact of proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in blackrock on the liability side deposit balances averaged billion and were up billion or linkedquarter borrowed funds decreased billion compared to the second quarter as we used our strong liquidity position to reduce borrowings primarily with the federal home loan bank and our tangible book value was per common share as of september an increase of linkedquarter and yearoveryear as you can see on slide our capital reserve and liquidity positions remain strong as of september our cet1 ratio was estimated to be our board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of per share and as you know the fed has authorized dividends for the fourth quarter again subject to amounts not exceeding the average of net income for the preceding four quarters on this basis our fourth quarter dividend is of that rolling number in regard to share repurchases and in accordance with the federal reserves directive well continue to suspend repurchases through the fourth quarter of our loan loss reserve levels are up slightly from at the end of june and our liquidity coverage ratios continue to significantly exceed the regulatory minimum requirements as we remain core funded with a lowcost deposit base slide shows our average loans and deposits in more detail average loan balances of billion in the third quarter were down billion or compared to the second quarter this decline reflected a billion decrease in commercial loan balances as new loan production was more than offset by broadbased lower utilization in our cib segment virtually all of the drawdowns that occurred in the first quarter have since paid back and our utilization rates are currently running approximately below prepandemic levels consumer loans declined approximately billion across all categories except for residential mortgage which increased compared to the same period a year ago average loans grew or billion as the slide shows the yield on our loan balances is a basis point decline in the second quarter and the rate paid on our interestbearing deposits was basis points an basis point decline linkedquarter average deposit balances of billion increased billion or commercial deposits grew reflecting the enhanced liquidity positions of our customers and consumer deposits also grew primarily due to government stimulus and lower consumer spending yearoveryear deposits increased billion or as you can see on slide third quarter total revenue was billion up million linkedquarter or net interest income of billion was down million or compared to the second quarter as lower earning asset yields and a decline in loan balances more than offset the benefit of lower funding costs and an extra day in the quarter our net interest margin decreased to down basis points linkedquarter reflecting the impact of higher balances held with the federal reserve bank which averaged billion for the quarter fed cash balances in excess of our lcr requirements were approximately billion which represented basis points of compression to our net interest margin noninterest income of billion increased million or linkedquarter fee revenue of billion increased million or compared to the second quarter asset management revenue increased million or primarily due to higher average equity markets the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 consumer services and service charges on deposits in total increased by million due to higher consumer activity and a decrease in fee waivers corporate services declined million or as higher treasury management product revenue was more than offset by lower advisoryrelated fees residential mortgage revenue declined million or driven by both lower servicing fees and lower loan sales revenue other noninterest income of million increased million and included a positive valuation adjustment of private equity investments compared with a negative valuation adjustment in the second quarter of a similar magnitude the positive valuation adjustment was partially offset by lower capital marketsrelated revenue noninterest expense increased million or less than compared to the second quarter provision for credit losses was million a decrease of billion as a provision expense for our commercial portfolio was largely offset by a provision recapture in our consumer portfolio and our effective tax rate was the lower rate was primarily related to increased tax credits during the quarter for the fourth quarter we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately turning to slide during the third quarter we generated positive operating leverage of sic in both the yearoveryear quarter and the yeartodate comparisons as a result our efficiency ratio improved to in the third quarter of compared to for both the prioryear third quarter and the nine months ended september while the current environment presents revenue challenges from low rates and pandemicrelated pressures we remain deliberate and disciplined around our expense management as we previously stated we have a goal to reduce costs by million in through our continuous improvement program and were confident well achieve our full year target as you know this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments slide is an update regarding specific industries weve identified as most likely to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic our outstanding loan balances as of september to these industries were billion or billion excluding ppp loans these balances declined compared to the second quarter primarily due to pay downs while we still havent experienced material chargeoffs in these industries we do expect to see charge offs increase over time should current economic trends continue commercial and industrial loan balances in this category totaled billion on september declining approximately billion or compared to the prior quarter nonperforming loans in these industries remain relatively low at of loans outstanding but were continuing to see downgrades with the greatest stress continuing to be in leisure and recreation looking at the lower half of this slide commercial real estate loans in this category totaled billion at the end of the third quarter declining million or compared to the prior quarter nonperforming loans increased approximately million and downgrades continue to occur primarily in retail and lodging correspondingly our reserves on our total commercial real estate portfolio have increased to from in the second quarter moving to slide we have seen a significant reduction in the number of consumers and small businesses requesting hardship assistance at the peak this summer we had granted modifications to more than consumer and small business accounts representing approximately billion of loans billion of these the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 loans were government guaranteed or investor owned which present very little credit risk to pnc of the remaining billion of loans that did present credit risk more than billion have rolled off payment assistance and of those accounts are current or less than days past due as a result we had billion of consumer and small business balances in some form of payment assistance as of september of those balances approximately are secured and more than of these accounts have made a payment in their last cycle on the commercial side were also continuing to selectively grant loan modifications based on each individual borrowers situation within our cib segment approximately million of loan balances were in deferral as of september when combining consumer and commercial customers loans on deferral posing credit risk to pnc approximate of total loan outstandings our credit metrics are presented on slide net chargeoffs for loans and leases were million down million from the second quarter commercial net chargeoffs were million and consumer net chargeoffs were million both down linkedquarter annualized net chargeoffs to total loans was basis points total delinquencies of billion at september declined million or consumer loan delinquencies decreased million and commercial loan delinquencies declined million nonperforming loans increased million or compared to june the increase was primarily driven by commercial real estate borrowers in the highimpact covid19 industries as you can see the allowance for credit losses to loans was at quarter end up slightly from last quarter we believe that our reserves sufficiently reflect the life of loan losses in the current portfolio slide highlights the components of the change in our allowance for credit losses yeartodate which have increased billion since december as a result our allowance for credit losses to total loans was and our allowance to nonperforming loans was our reserves have increased materially this year due to the adoption of cecl and significant changes in the macroeconomic outlook during the first half of the year in the third quarter portfolio changes primarily driven by lower loan balances reduced reserves by million in addition our economic outlook improved modestly during the quarter but this was offset by increased reserves for both commercial and consumer borrowers adversely impacted by the pandemic in total this resulted in a million decline in our reserves to billion in summary pnc posted solid third quarter results and we believe our balance sheet is well positioned for this challenging environment for the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of we expect average loans to decline low single digits we expect net interest income to be stable we expect core fee income to be stable we expect other noninterest income to be between million and million resulting in our expectation that total noninterest income will be down in the high singledigit range we expect total noninterest expense to be up approximately and in regard to net chargeoffs we expect fourth quarter levels to be between million and million importantly after taking all this into account were on pace to deliver positive operating leverage between and for the full year of and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 bryan k gill executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc okay question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from john pancari with evercore isi please proceed john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning guys robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the loan loss reserve it looks like you released reserves a bit in the quarter although your acl percentage increased given the loan balance decline is it fair to assume that if we do see chargeoffs continue to increase from here like in the fourth quarter for example that we would expect that you probably still will not match the chargeoffs with provision and accordingly continue to put up loan loss reserve releases william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc theres a lot of variables that kind of go into that answer john but remember again when we put up the second quarter reserve the assumption based on our economic forecast in the models a bit was that we covered all of the losses we knew about at that point in time at the margin the economy has gotten perhaps a little bit better on the forecast and so were kind of as chargeoffs go up were using in effect the reserves that we provided for in the second quarter so that all else equal should continue unless we have deterioration from our current forecast on what the economy is doing but the general principle is all else equal as loans run down and charge offs go through thats what weve reserved for robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right john pancari q analyst evercore isi thats helpful got it and then on that same topic the chargeoff trajectory just given what you expect in terms of the ongoing migration you saw and indicated that the nonperformers saw some pressure when do you expect that youll see the greatest pressure and chargeoffs build as this plays out are we looking more like the first half of next year is where we get the greatest upside pressure in terms of loss content the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc again it depends on a lot of things not the least of which is what fiscal stimulus they put out there if any but all else equal it probably starts showing up in the second half of next year my own belief is were probably going to see more pressure on covidsensitive industries real estate earlier on and then consumers flow through as we get into the back half of next year but it all depends where the consumer number in my view is going to be highly dependent on whether they provide more fiscal stimulus which i think they absolutely need to do robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey john i would just add to that i think its all speculation at this point but mid2021 feels right john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it no thats helpful if i could just ask one more on the just to ask the ma question in a different way bill if we get a biden victory next month and the political environment potentially could move more against big bank deals how does that influence your appetite for a larger deal could you pursue smaller bank deals given that or possibly just view buybacks more attractively just want to get your thoughts william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey look youre making a whole bunch of assumptions in there the regulation as i understand it as its written in the laws i understand it and its written basically to the extent that we were to do a deal and not cause a systemic risk to the economy ultimately it has to go through approval process and be approved they can delay it they can hold hearings they can do all sorts of different things but basically it gets approved so even in a change in administration the assumption that somehow they either change laws on this particular issue even if they switch governors the regulatory process is still the same so i dont know that thats a real risk i would say that as weve always said the smaller deals arent off the table but they require a fair amount of work for less total return in effect can we do a bunch of them yeah we could do a bunch of them over time john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thats helpful thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc theres a lot of things to play id say john a lot of things to play out and i mean our thinking generally hasnt changed william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 john pancari q analyst evercore isi right right got it all right thank you operator our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies please proceed ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning guys thanks for taking the question robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah good morning ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc just got a couple of questions on nii nice to see that you guys are expecting nii to be stable sequentially and im just wondering if you can help us flush out like what parts of the loan book are you still expecting to see come down and how is that being offset with other parts of the kind of earning asset statement in terms of being able to keep the nii stable thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah hey ken good morning yeah so when we take a look at the nii stable there is obviously the earning asset side and the liability side i think weve made up a lot of ground on the liability side i think we can still do some more there when we look at the fourth quarter in terms of loan balances commercial we still see being relatively flattish and again this all depends on what happens and consumer we could see some uptick there particularly if theres some stimulus i think the other factor for us and for the industry in terms of the fourth quarter will be the rate at which ppp loans are forgiven we have an expectation built into our guidance that about half of what we have will be forgiven and thats built into our guidance in the fourth quarter and then the other half in the first quarter of so thats probably the biggest play in terms of how nii and total loans william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but we continue to drop funding costs robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc i said that yeah i said that on the frontend yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and my followup the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and weve got some more room to go ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right and my followup actually rob is on that ppp front the ci loan yields were actually stable down basis point i was wondering if you can help us understand the contribution from ppprelated interest income this quarter versus last and again how that plays through in terms of the yields and the forgiveness and fees and all that it gets really tricky right thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc it does it does get a little tricky id say a good number for us in terms of our guidance would be about million in nii related to ppp forgiveness in the fourth quarter so thatll help you size it william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but straight ci loan spread i think were up robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right spreads up yields are down william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc theyre still grinding down as we roll down into lower libors yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right so about million ken on the ppp ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc do you have just what that was in the third quarter versus the million robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah it was much smaller ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood okay thanks guys the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question comes from erika najarian with bank of america please proceed erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning another firm that is going through this downturn solidly jpmorgan was essentially chomping at the bit in terms of appetite for buybacks once the fed lifts its restrictions and bill im wondering given the amount of excess capital youre sitting on if the fed does lift at its restrictions by the first quarter or second quarter of next year how patient are you going to be in terms of thinking about your inorganic opportunities versus buying back your stock here at a narrower premium to tangible book than the stock usually enjoys william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so you should assume that we would otherwise be in the market but you should also assume that well be patient in looking at acquisitions through time notwithstanding covid the environment for banks is going to be tough going forward for all the obvious reasons so we continue to think that theres going to be a lot of opportunities out there the other thing with respect to buybacks i mean the only thing i think you ever know for certain is trying to spend as much capital as we have all in a big hurry almost never works out and makes sense so well be in the market to a certain degree but not enough that it changes our focus on the opportunities that we see in our ph deck and expansion through acquisition erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and its quite conceivable we do both william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch yeah yeah got it william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc in fact indiscernible the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch and as a followup question this management team has always been ahead in terms of warning us about the excesses that were building up in the system precovid and im wondering as we think about the chargeoffs that were coming as a followup to johns question do you think that the current programs from the government and the fed have effectively redefined cumulative credit losses lower for this cycle or are we just kicking the realization down the road william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look theyve definitely helped but with ppp effectively running out and with cares act having run out were going to see an acceleration we did a survey into small business and smaller commercial and i think of the respondents if im remembering this right basically said if this continues for another year theyll be out of business robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc alarmingly high william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah an incredible percentage and a lot of those guys have gotten by either through ppp or simply drawing on reserves and operating at an unsustainable level and somethings got to give my guess is and thats why we kind of talk about chargeoffs ramping up as we get into kind of the midback half of next year my guess is its still theres going to be a lot thats going to show up erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and future fiscal support is a big variable william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator our next question comes from gerald cassidy sic gerard cassidy with rbc please proceed bryan k gill a executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc hi gerard the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning guys bryan k gill a executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc good morning good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning guys thank you bill can you give us some thoughts obviously you guys pointed out that you have had billion up at the federal reserve and clearly thats weighing on your net interest margin like your peers because of the influx in deposits can you kind of give us some color if that level if your customers just dont start using their deposits and its now heading into the second quarter of next year is there anything you can do to shift that money out of there to get a higher yield without taking too much interest rate risk william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc theres actually billion there i think on a spot basis robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc spot basis william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah no look youre seeing it not just on the deposit side but our utilization rate on credits down i think from the precovid levels the economy just isnt running right so corporates are using less on their lines theyre creating less inventory theyre doing less investment theyre holding more cash and i dont know that that necessarily abates particularly with the size of the feds balance sheet looking like its going to remain at least stable in terms of redeployment its hard to find something that you see in size that offers a good risk return were doing a lot of things at the margin both on the lending side and some of the specialty finance areas and even on the security side that offer a lot of value but theyre not enough to dent that amount of the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc substantially faster william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and trying to force that outcome so right we can just go out and buy billion worth of 10years at basis points and to make a lot of money for some short period of time its a lousy risk return tradeoff so well be opportunistic but my best guess is were going to be sitting on a lot of cash for a pretty long period of time as well the whole banking industry gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then moving over to credit obviously you guys have been through cycles before and is there aside from what has caused this down cycle we all know was quite unique when you look at the commercial credits that youve been forced to write down or the commercial real estate that you have been forced to write down there have been many different or any differences between what you saw in the last cycle or the cycle in terms of writedowns that has surprised you or is it just very similar to the past downturns william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no its i mean if you go all the way back most real estate problems historically came from projects so office buildings that were built that were never occupied so you can remember boston when you could see straight through downtown because nobody was in it thats where the big losses historically have come from this is an instance where real estate is struggling even though in theory everything is leased up right but you have if you think about retail nobody is paying rent right so malls are getting killed and they were already on a decline robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hotels william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hotels are obvious a lot of things that in a normal downturn would have probably still cash flowed and been fine or struggling from a cash flow basis interestingly in this one versus the other ones the loan to values for the assets notwithstanding the lack of cash flow still look pretty good robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc very good yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so this is real estate come up with yet another way to hurt the industry again the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for the color william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator operator instructions our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning bill and rob robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc bill you said in response to john pancaris earlier question that the consumer number will depend on whether theres more physical stimulus would you expect stimulus to be less beneficial on the commercial side william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its a fair question it depends if they redo ppp in some form that obviously helped out thousands and thousands and thousands of smaller business commercial borrowers and kept people employed the consumer side one of the things weve watched and have talked about before is the extra that came in from the cares act for unemployment benefits allowed consumers to substantially build cash balances and pay down debt now that that has gone away youre basically seeing the balance excess they had in their dda accounts decline which is why im worried about consumers but no look if they redid ppp it would substantially affect the amount of small business commercial chargeoffs weve had small business and you guys already know this the small business commercial people who have less access to other forms of capital are really getting hurt in this environment bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thats very helpful i guess following up on your cre comments it seems like there maybe greater willingness among banks to work with borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty but maybe theres a bit less patience for example with some say cmbs conduits set up by private equity companies robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc and then that raises the question of whether the likelihood of foreclosure is higher outside of the banking system do you think thats the case and if so do you think it could result in growing pressure on commercial real estate prices and then maybe sort of just to cap off like can you share your thoughts on how an effective vaccine by say mid2021 would impact your view of the ultimate loss content within cre theres a lot there but would just love to hear your thoughts on those william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah indiscernible so at the margin banks have always been more willing to work with borrowers than a contractual cmbs relationship where that midland where is a fiduciary working on behalf of the various credit tranches having said that weve actually been surprised by the turnover that weve seen in our special servicing portfolio in midland so weve actually seen a couple of things one the bpiece buyers being willing to work with borrowers probably in a way they havent in past environments and two to the extent that they say no take the asset theres a lot of capital on the sidelines from traditional bpiece buyers robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right thats right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc who are effectively writing it off in one fund and rebuying it in another one so the turnover has been pretty high a bit to my surprise theres a pretty active secondary market for real estate properties at the moment probably it doesnt carry through to all types i imagine theres not a good bid for strip malls but for other types of properties theres robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well to your earlier point the nature of this pandemic crises and these loan to values william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sort of support that the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the covid vaccine i have zero predictions assumptions on when if how and whether it works and all of the above so ill just pass that robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah we know what you know on that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats fair if i may squeeze in one last one bill can you share your thoughts around the direct neobanks sort of the chimes and others out there that operate exclusively online without traditional branch networks in this sort of postcovid environment how you see their presence impacting the competitive environment over say the next three to five years and is there any potential benefit to deploying some of the blackrock proceeds on a neobank or are those sort of capabilities things that you think you can build on your own william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc im trying to contain myself i wish we had the opportunity to basically not have to make any money and grow customers by giving stuff away and running our back office on a thirdparty bank system thats written in cobol from years ago but we dont have that luxury robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the tech capability of these guys theres nothing that they have that we dont have nothing that they have that we cant produce if we wanted to have our platforms are much more modern than their platforms theyre all running on thirdparty banks which is a whole another issue that drives me insane and they basically do free accounts and no overdraft and simple simplification they find very low balance customers and i just dont think longterm that model works i think that delivery multiple delivery channel model that includes real care centers and customer service we see that through our nps scores through atm delivery networks through branch delivery networks and through top line digital is going to win robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and ph vr technology the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and without that look its kind of cool and theyre growing lots of customers but like a lot of things theyre not making money at it and banking is a business that you ultimately need to make money at sorry theres my rant bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats great robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc good question good question bill

certainly have been ahead in expressing concern about the way this covid situation plays out or how do you feel just in the last three months on the one hand you do see the fixed income market securities which have come in and i know you know that market you have low line utilizations which means probably that firms arent quite ready to go bankrupt you see your chargeoff rate being exceptionally low on the other hand who knows if we have a second wave its a w or how that plays out so just whats your temperature on the outlook over the next couple of years and do you have seller remorse for selling blackrock or do you say hey you know what i feel even better today the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so a couple of things going into this if we look at the corporate side notwithstanding utilization being down corporate america is levered four times today we went into the crisis levered three times which we all thought was high none of that has changed the one thing that gives me a little bit of comfort certainly relative to my initial concerns on this environment as i think weve defined the downside mike so when we went into this we really had no idea of what in fact the downside could be we didnt know mortality rates there were no real treatments for covid there was no vaccine on the so all of the things we didnt know how to define the downside so i think the best thing i can tell you is i think weve defined the downside is that we at this point muddle along pretty much where we are in the economy and i think that plays out through time and i think losses grind out through time as we said we think at this point were reserved for that environment do i have sellers remorse i dont and not surprisingly ive gotten that question i think theres a lot of things i regret in life with hindsight and all else equal i wish we were selling blackrock today at as opposed to when we sold them at the start of this thing but i think with the information we had in our hands it was the right decision i hope that people and i know a number of our shareholders bought blackrock when we sold it i hope you bought it and rode that stock up that was always your choice we were always going to be left with this basic notion that eventually we were going to have a tax burden that looks like its going to come to fruition eventually we were going to have regulatory pressure eventually and not eventually we already had a concentrated asset that was outside of our control and id much rather deploy that capital into something that is within our control so i wouldnt change the decision based on what we knew at the time and what our strategic direction is and what i think the opportunity set is going forward i still remain im trying to find the right word here but confident that having capital in this coming environment is going to be incredibly valuable and open up a lot of inorganic opportunities for us robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well just to your point theres a lot of the game left to play william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah anybody who thought wed have the sp where it is today when we sold blackrock give me a call because ill invest some money with you i just that was if i made a mistake and ive made many in my life
