like to turn the call over to bill william stanton demchak chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bryan and good morning everybody as youve seen we had a strong fourth quarter and full year for we successfully completed the conversion of bbva usa early in the fourth quarter and have been running hard as one bank since then the transaction continues to meet or exceed our deal projections and rob will give you some of those details im especially pleased by our ability to announce close and convert a transaction of this size inside of months challenges notwithstanding we had the talent the technology and the strategy to accomplish this and to combine our organizations in a way that will provide growth opportunities for years to come the acquisition positions us with a coasttocoast presence and along with our continued organic growth strategies including our recent expansion into las vegas we now have a presence in all of the top us markets were excited about the opportunity this presents and we are confident in our ability to generate growth by executing on our main street relationshipbased model that said we recognize that we have a lot of work to do in building out the new and expansion markets which will be our primary focus in bbva obviously impacted our results for the full year and rob will walk you through the details excluding bbva we generated record revenue highlighted by strong noninterest income with broadbased contributions across our commercial and consumer businesses we also maintained outstanding credit quality and a very strong capital position while we continue to opportunistically deploy some of our excess cash into higheryielding securities throughout the year we remain wellpositioned with substantial excess liquidity to capitalize on a rising interest rate environment our reported results for the fourth quarter reflected the impact of almost million of bbva integration costs excluding these we generated nearly billion of net income and solid returns importantly excluding the impact of ppp loan forgiveness we saw decent underlying loan growth trends and some uptick in utilization rates which is very encouraging as rob will discuss in more detail the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 critical to our longterm success has been the quality and stability of our talent and we pride ourselves as being an employer of choice given the recent dynamics of the substantially increased competition for talent in part due to the great resignation we experienced greater wage pressure during the fourth quarter and i expect that to persist into the coming year naturally well look to offset these increases with our continuous improvement efforts which include driving further automation and rethinking core processes we continue to invest in technology to enhance our capabilities in an increasingly digital world customers are looking to their financial providers to offer innovative tools that help them manage their money in ways that are faster smarter and more convenient whether thatd be expanded use cases for zelle where transaction volumes are up or low cash mode for example by providing account transparency and control low cash mode has substantially reduced customer overdraft fees and related complaints ill close by thanking our employees for their hard work and steadfast commitment to our customers and communities because of our employees we had a remarkable year and are wellpositioned to serve all of our stakeholders in and beyond and with that ill turn it over to rob for a closer look at our results and then well take your questions robert q reilly chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thanks bill and good morning everyone our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on an average basis overall yearoveryear balance sheet growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of bbva usa loans grew investment securities increased and deposits grew looking at the linkedquarter changes loans for the fourth quarter were billion a decline of billion or excluding billion of ppp forgiveness activity loans grew billion or and ill cover the drivers in more detail over the next few slides investment securities increased billion or as we maintained higher purchasing activity throughout much of the quarter accordingly cash balances at the federal reserve declined by billion on the liability side deposit balances declined billion as higher commercial and consumer deposits were offset by runoff deposits related to the strategic repricing of certain bbva usa portfolios during the third quarter and that negatively impacted fourth quarter average balances however on a spot basis total deposits as of december increased billion or reflecting the continued strong liquidity positions of our customers at yearend our tangible book value was per common share and our cet1 ratio was estimated to be which are both substantially above the pro forma levels we anticipated when we announced the deal during the quarter we returned approximately billion of capital to shareholders via common dividends of million and share repurchases of million given our strong capital ratios we continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility going forward slide shows our average loans and deposits in more detail in the fourth quarter loans declined billion as growth in commercial and consumer loans was more than offset by a decline in ppp loans of billion excluding the impact of ppp commercial loans grew by billion or driven by growth in corporate banking and assetbased lending the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 during the fourth quarter we continued to see a slow and steady increase in utilization rates within our corporate institutional banking business and along with that expanded pipelines taken together these factors are driving our expectations for higher loan growth in consumer loans increased modestly linkedquarter as higher residential real estate balances were mostly offset by lower home equity and auto loans finally as i mentioned ppp loans continued to decline due to forgiveness activity and as of december billion of ppp loans remained on our balance sheet average deposits of billion declined by billion linkedquarter for the reasons i previously mentioned overall our rate paid on interestbearing deposits remained stable at basis points slide details the change in our average securities and federal reserve balances as rates increased at the end of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter we continued to opportunistically add securities to our portfolio primarily us treasuries as a result securities balances averaged billion in the fourth quarter an increase of billion or compared to the third quarter and now represent of interestearning assets we continue to have substantial excess liquidity with fed cash balances averaging billion during the fourth quarter which we believe positions us well for a rising rate environment as you can see on slide fourth quarter reported eps was which included pretax integration costs of million excluding integration costs adjusted eps was as expected during the fourth quarter we incurred essentially half of our total anticipated deal integration costs which reduced revenue by million and increased expenses by million since the announcement of the acquisition weve now incurred approximately of the total million expected integration costs including million of writeoffs for capitalized items excluding the impact of integration costs linkedquarter revenue was down million or expenses increased million or and pretax preprovision earnings declined million or the fourth quarter provision recapture was million reflecting continued improvements in the economic environment net income excluding pretax integration costs of million was billion in the fourth quarter now lets discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail turning to slide these charts illustrate our diversified business mix total revenue for the fourth quarter of billion decreased million linkedquarter reflecting lower noninterest income net interest income of billion was up slightly primarily a result of higher securities balances net interest margin was stable at as i mentioned integration costs reduced noninterest income by million which included million of lease exit costs million of treasury management fee waivers and million of overdraft waivers fourth quarter fee income excluding integration costs was billion and declined million or linked quarter looking at the detail asset management fees increased million or primarily related to higher average equity markets consumer services grew million or due to higher brokerage and credit card revenue corporate service fees increased million or reflecting higher loan syndications activity as well as continued elevated corporate advisory activity residential mortgage noninterest income declined million driven by lower rmsr valuation adjustments and loan sales revenue service charges on deposits decreased million primarily a result of converting bbva usa customers to pncs product and overdraft pricing structure other noninterest income excluding integration costs was stable linkedquarter as the impact of a million positive visa derivative fair value adjustment in the fourth quarter compared to a negative adjustment of million in the third quarter was offset by lower private equity revenue the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 turning to slide our fourth quarter expenses were up by million or linkedquarter the growth was primarily driven by million increase in integration expenses excluding the impact of integration expenses of million noninterest expense increased million or the growth was largely within personnel costs driven by higher employee benefits expense an increase in our minimum hourly rate of pay as well as elevated incentive compensation related to strong fee activity we had a goal of million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal looking forward to our annual cip goal will once again be million importantly as of yearend we completed all of the actions that will drive million of savings related to the bbva usa acquisition which we expect to be fully realized in and is reflected in our expense guidance that i will provide in a few minutes our credit metrics are presented on slide nonperforming loans of billion decreased million or compared to september 30th and continue to represent less than of total loans total delinquencies of billion on december 31st increased million or obviously this was a large increase but it was primarily driven by bbva usa conversionrelated administrative and operational delays which we expect will largely be resolved within the first half of net chargeoffs for loans and leases were million an increase of million linkedquarter commercial net chargeoffs declined million offset by an increase of million in consumer inside of the higher consumer net chargeoffs auto grew million and other consumer increased million reflecting conversionrelated impacts as well as seasonality our annualized net chargeoffs to average loans continues to be low and in the fourth quarter was basis points and during the fourth quarter our allowance for credit losses declined million reflecting continued improvements in the economic environment at quarterend our reserves were billion representing of loans in summary pnc reported a strong fourth quarter which concluded a successful and were wellpositioned for as we continue to realize the potential of our coasttocoast franchise in regard to our view of the overall economy we expect strong growth over the course of resulting in gdp growth we also expect four 25basispoint increases in the fed funds rate in beginning in may followed by additional increases in june september and december looking ahead our full year guidance for includes the impact of months of bbva usa results compared to only seven months in taking that into account our outlook for full year compared to results is as follows we expect average loan growth of approximately and on a spot basis we expect total revenue growth to be to we expect expenses excluding integration expense to be up to and to be clear here this includes five additional months of bbva usa operating expenses which equates to a full year increase of approximately million and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately based on this guidance we expect we will generate solid positive operating leverage in looking ahead at the first quarter of compared to the recent fourth quarter results we expect average loan balances excluding ppp to be up approximately to we expect nii to be down approximately to the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 reflecting two fewer days in the quarter and a decline of approximately million in ppprelated interest income we expect fee income to be down to due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity as well as elevated fourth quarter fees in certain categories we expect other noninterest income to be between million and million excluding integration costs as well as net securities and visa activity taking our guidance for all components of revenue into consideration we expect total revenue to decline approximately to we expect total noninterest expense excluding integration costs to be down approximately to and during the quarter we expect to incur million of integration expense and finally we expect first quarter net chargeoffs to be between million and million and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions as a reminder this conference is being recorded thank you our first question comes from the line of dave george with baird please proceed with your question david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc hey guys good morning i had a question about capital and capital allocation you obviously finished the year at cet1 which is ahead of kind of your initial targets when you announced bbva and your stock is at of tangible book and i know youve talked about taking the cash dividend payout up so just kind of curious bill how youre thinking about capital allocation in the new year and then ive got one followup william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well you kind of answered your own question because were consistent all else equal in this environment first focus on the potential of loan growth and using it a good way a bias strong bias towards dividend but well still be in the market to repurchase shares and i think youll probably see us accelerate some of the things were doing on the smaller side in terms of product activity boltons into tm and so forth none of that by the way those acquisitions wont add up to much but theyve become an important part of just adding core capabilities as we go into a digitized world david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc okay thanks for that and then a question on your guidance in particular nii i know you mentioned youve got four hikes in there i assume youre using the forward curve and the securities as a percentage of earning assets up to i know bill youve talked about being to do you expect continued liquidity deployment just kind of curious how much liquidity deployment is embedded in that number thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 so our economist expects four hikes i actually think its going to be more aggressive than that but im an outlier in our committee and we robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the only one vote yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc our forecast is at this point pretty much on the forward curve at this point i think the plan rob i dont know if you want to talk to the plan of were going to gradually add duration throughout the year there wasnt any magic to it and we didnt really build in in robs guidance some assumption that we would go at it even more aggressively for each reacted robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc in the range that we have that to range dave is still the range thats in our guidance william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc okay thanks appreciate it william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator thank you and up next we now have a question from the line of john pancari with evercore please proceed with your question john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning guys william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey morning john the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the revenue guide for the full year of to i just wanted to see if you could help unpack that a little bit in terms of how you view the nii trajectory for the year and what type of growth you think is reasonable versus the trajectory on the fee income side of things given some of the dynamics you flagged thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure john so full year revenue up to break down those components net interest income up low teens and that does factor in the rate increases that we spoke about in the opening comments and then on the fees midsingle digits yearoveryear so those two together gets you to the to john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks thats helpful and then on the loan growth front just given the endofperiod loan growth expectations certainly implies an acceleration that you indicated that youre seeing could you give us a little more color on the growth trends that you think is achievable on the commercial side versus consumer and maybe what are you expecting to be the biggest drivers of that acceleration as you look at the loan book robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure so for the full year guide its average but probably a better indicator is the spot just because of the acquisition dynamics on the average number so spot up from period end and we see a continuation of what we started to see in the fourth quarter which was some expanded utilization in the commercial book picking up through and then a little bit less on the consumer side consumer customers are still pretty flush with cash so loan demand there certainly in the first half of we expect to be softer than the commercial side john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it that helps thanks yeah i meant to say average on the growth robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah john pancari q analyst evercore isi i appreciate the color thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc you bet operator thank you and now we have a question from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your question the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc wanted to followup on the questions on whats embedded in the nii guide rob you answered the question on what youre assuming for liquidity deployment but what are you assuming in your nii guide about the trajectory of deposit beta and what do you think will actually happen robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well in terms of our guidance erika what we apply in terms of beta is what weve seen in past cycles which generally speaking will be a lag on the front end so my expectation and what we built into the guidance is that we will see some beta increase but not until the end of and it will probably be more of a factor in just because of the levels of liquidity and deposits that we have erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay so if im comparing it to your previous deposit beta in terms of lets say in to to actually the first basis points your guidance assumes a slower ramp than that robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right thats exactly right erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and the second followup question is for bill one of your peers jamie had obviously given a guidance for higher expenses in pointing to accelerated investment spend as we think about this to obviously some of this is the bbva baseline but did you frontload some of the investment spend in in other words as your investors start thinking about pncs profitability in a normalized rising rate environment is to an appropriate guidepost for future growth in expenses going past william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no no so to unpack the guide for next year i think the pnc legacy expenses are up maybe robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the nonbbva usa the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and so did we prepack investment weve said all along that weve had a steady state and actually a fairly high level of investment in our core business and then youll remember in the guidance for bbva that in the million of cost saves that was a netted number against investments we are going to make to build out those markets so inside of everything youre seeing there actually has a lot of investment already built into it robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and of course our continuous improvement of million offsets the investments and thats something that weve been doing for a number of years william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it helpful william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i also think its worth noting weve had some debate internally on the continuous improvement number and can it be larger because i think we all see opportunities in the operating environment as we move forward with bbva the challenge is continuous improvement is something you know you can do whereas right now were still in the process of we know its there we just dont know where yet once we kind of lock it down and can track it it shows up in continuous improvement robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah and that wont stop us from going after it william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc exactly the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you operator thank you and we now have a question from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so two questions one just on how were thinking about the reinvestment in the securities portfolio as we think about the nii guide as well maybe you could give us a little sense of the pace that youre thinking about reinvesting i mean whats baked into your nii guide because as we know the forward curve does suggest were going to be hitting pretty soon so do you wait for that or do you start to leg in even at current rates william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we will leg in throughout the course but remember whats in our guide on securities doesnt dent our liquidity profile so what we have in our guide here is kind of steady deployment working towards the to well add balances it doesnt even dent the potential of what we could do with liquidity robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc with the fed cash balances william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc youre still looking for that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so its a baseline budget boring the rates do this we do the following if rates go beyond or even if we get to a place where we think rates have probably gone where they need to go not as high as i think theyll go we could increase that but thats not contemplated in the forecast that we have right now the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc because am i right in thinking your target range of securities to earning assets like to is that fair william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just to followup william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but remember inside of that mix right thats a big portfolio of securities the big difference in the yield coming out of buying shortdated treasuries which has been kind of our recent trade versus going further out the curve and going back towards mortgages once you assume the extension risk is taken out massive difference in yields so some of its notional of securities some of its what youre actually buying and both of those will be driven by the speed and outlook for rates over time betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right so what im hearing is baseline in the expectation but upside as we approach kind of rates reflecting your view of full extension risk on the rmbs side william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah no if my individual view is right theres a lot of upside but the forecast that weve given you and whats kind of in our plan is steady state follow the forwards and leg in over time betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well in simpler terms the yields on the securities portfolio can change a lot william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right right right right i got it okay and then separately just thinking a little bit longerterm bill on the investments that youre doing could you just give us a little bit of color as to what are you looking for in these bolton acquisitions to enhance your digitization what pieces of your digitization are you looking to improve and also is there a need for reinvestment in branches in the new geographies where maybe you would have had a slightly different skew to the branch mix just trying to understand a little more detail out there william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc two very different questions as youve seen weve done a number of small things tempus probably being the most interesting one where we bring in certain payment capabilities that lead to other opportunities and we see more and more of those by the way were not unique at that a lot of banks are playing in the space theyre not terribly expensive but oftentimes you get modules of technology that can be sort of bought into and then scaled across your broader platform i just think youre going to see more of that as we continue to compete in a digital space for both the consumer and the corporate on the branch side we have plans to further as we always do kind of build out selectively in the markets where were underpenetrated but at the same time youll see us continue our practice of consolidating the thicker markets so no real change there and all thats in the numbers weve given you betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator thank you and we now have a question from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead with your question gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi rob hi bill robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc good morning gerard william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc good morning the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys give us a little color im trying to figure out what were going to be talking about in the fourth quarter earnings call for in january of and i think credit might be a subject that receives more attention then can you share with us your underwriting standards how you compare them today to lets say right at the start of the pandemic and then comparing them to how they look compared to today william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so youve got to separate something our credit box per se right so the type of clients we lend to the leverage they can have all the things you would otherwise measure we really dont change that over time having said that of course even inside of that box companies are doing better or they are doing trending more poorly i think were going to go into a period of time here as we go towards the end of the year where all else equal there will be pressure on credit not because we changed our underwriting standards but because of the upgradedowngrade ratio will change rob and i were talking before the call if you actually look at our reserve ratio particularly when you adjust it for credit cards i cant think of a period of time where youre kind of going into rising rate environment which is going to help us loan growth which is going to help us and feeling healthy reserves when you compare where we are versus ill just call it that versus the rest of the industry in terms of raw percentages against balance and our book through legacy performance robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and resulting from the unique dynamics of the pandemic so its an unusual setup william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup you have some decent loan growth rob that you pointed to for robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc within the commercial growth areas ci not real estate but ci robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right right the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you share with us or give us more color are they coming from the newer markets that you guys have entered over the last five or six years or are you seeing early traction with the bbva customers maybe if you could dissect where some of them might come from in william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well the new money out right so the new clients and new money that we are committing whether its drawn or not has accelerated for the last bunch of months and a lot of that is related to the newer markets were in including some big wins coming out of the bbva markets the utilization part right so the money is out now is somebody borrowing more under what line is broadbased and if you just think about how many clients we have its kind of distributed across everything robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah the other thing that id add to that gerard is that the pipelines in our commercial book are strong and in the new markets theyre up percentagewise significantly gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator thank you we now have a question from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc bill you led off saying that the bbva has exceeded expectations but i dont think i heard any changes to expense savings or synergies or anything like that so even if you cant quantify it can you talk about whats going better or worse than expected william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well look better than expected on initial deal terms is largely the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah is largely the economy right the assumptions where we marked credit and looked at credit turned out to be wildly conservative but and thats what we saw at that point but better than expected if i look at it i think the teams that weve been able to deploy in the market some of the talent that bbva had some of the talent we were able to hire that the amount of call volume that were having in the new markets with new products and old clients and with new products and people with new clients all sort of wildly outpacing what we were able to do with rbc in our newer markets in the past and then just wins showing up with clients early on so thats kind of all in the business momentum side and continues to give us comfort on our ability to build out the markets the credit is a lot better than we thought the expense guide we go out there and we say wed take million including investment and we stick to that but to robs point you guys know this of us through time it doesnt mean that were going to stop looking once we hit our expense guide and i guess id just leave it there mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc where youre leaving it is i guess was really my question so why not increase your expense saving target or quantify that is that because youre reinvesting it or youre just being conservative or youre just waiting longer william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think the easiest way to answer that is when i was talking about continuous improvement a little while ago mike we kind of know theres stuff there through some metrics and some thought process today but until we can put an action plan together quantify it know how were going to measure it i cant im not just going to throw an expense guide in there that probably is embedded but im not sure robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and i just think this is rob mike i just think its premature so we worked hard in to get that million in savings into that billion run rate so we got to get going and this is the gettinggoing part mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then i know part of your youre in all top us markets now and i know you want to expand and so you did guide for you said solid positive operating leverage for the year i get that on the other hand isnt it getting a lot more expensive to hire people to help with that expansion in the new markets william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc it is but weve largely hired them off you need to understand when we closed and then converted we had basically the teams built out in all of these markets mike so theyre in our run rate the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i mean how many people did you hire i mean because these are a lot of new markets william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc a lot mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and stuff right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah a lot of people robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc but hey if the extension of your question is are we going to see do we expect to see wage pressure in we do william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and that is built into our expense guidance mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay fair enough all right thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator thank you operator instructions up next we have a question from the line of bill carcache with wolf research please proceed with your question bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning bill and rob following up on your deposit beta commentary how are you thinking about the risk that balance sheet runoff the potential impact it could have in this cycle versus the last one given that its expected to play a bit bigger role versus when we exited the last serve cycle the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its a great question and thats obviously going to impact it and in the extreme if they shrink their balance sheet dramatically it obviously would impact betas and make them higher the offset to that though is you got to remember with loan growth you actually create deposits right so if loan growth does pick up bizarrely as the fed is dropping their balance sheet which isnt unlikely that loan growth actually generates deposits if you think about just the leverage on the capital you hold for a loan and the money goes everywhere else robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so im not sure ive iterated my way through exactly how thats going to play out other than it feels like the combination of those two things should leave us extremely liquid depositwise for the next several years robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc which is our base expectation but youve got to keep an eye on it william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah that makes sense i guess continuing on that thought process bill do you feel pnc is perhaps a little bit less exposed than some of the larger banks that are primary dealers and more directly involved in the creation of those deposits under the qe process william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i dont think the system works that way if the fed shrinks its balance sheet you will likely see corporate cash i dont know that you can think through it that way i think it transmits through the banking system and i think it hits everybody largely the same as a function of their corporate and consumer mix but corporates behave like corporates and consumers behave like consumers bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it and then lastly i think you touched on this but just to put a finer point on it if the pipelines of strong loan growth trends that youre describing persist i guess maybe if you could just comment on your willingness to or the extent to which that influences your willingness to take your securities portfolio as high as i guess do you think your liquidity is sufficient to be able to do both fund that stronger loan growth the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc and take your securities portfolio higher or yeah i just wondered how does that interaction work william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we have plenty of liquidity to do both bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah got it thank you for taking my questions william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thank you operator thank you thank you and we now have a question from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning guys just wanted to followup rob i think you had mentioned when you broke down the revenue guide is that youre looking at mid in the midsingle digits and obviously that also includes the bbva stuff robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc last year you had a ridiculously great year for corporate services especially im just wondering underneath the surface what do you see as being the underlying growth drivers outside of the bbva rollover robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah i would just say if youre taking a look at the full year ken just going through the categories asset management we would expect to continue to increase in that midsingle digit range consumer higher than that in part due to the addition of the bbva franchise the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 but as you hit it on corporate services we had such elevated levels in our expectations for are down a bit residential mortgage may be up a little bit and then service charges on deposits down as we get the full year effect of reduced overdraft fees that we expect from low cash mode so you put all that together thats how you get to midsingle digits ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then same thing in terms of just how youre thinking about that other category is it still within the kind of zone youre thinking about for the first quarter is that how you think about it for the full year robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc that is yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay one little cleanup just on securities yields rob last quarter you had that negative impact from the bbva robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc we did that yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc portfolio mark and then this quarter it was flattish even i would think with the absence of that so can you kind of just work us through what was the impact in the fourth quarter if any and are you at the point where youre seeing better reinvestment yields robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah were starting to i think investment yields was the story on the premium amortization issue of the third quarter which was elevated it went down in the fourth quarter but its still elevated over what i would consider normal levels so that worked against us a little bit as well ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay understood all right thanks rob robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator thank you and we now have a question from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead sir the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hey guys one more on the expenses its pretty impressive for the expense guide for if i look at it relative to kind of fourth quarter annualized it implies a quarterly run rate thats about lower rob so i guess just kind of unpacking that is the fourth quarter this year a little high because of such strong capital markets revenues robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research and then how are you eating inflation and still getting cost to be lower yearoveryear when other banks are having a lot of inflationary pressures that would be helpful robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah no you hit it its definitely on the wage side in the fourth quarter and it just goes back as we go into it goes back to what we were saying earlier in terms of how we laid out the year we have the cost saves locked in for the bbva side we have investments on the nonbbva side that are largely offset by our continuous improvement numbers so thats how we put it all together and thats the plan william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john just because i know all of our employees are listening this plan assumes that we are paying people competitively in a competitive market for talented people we just need to find the dollars elsewhere to be able to do that robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay got it and then one industrytype question for you guys you have a lot of reserves relative to peers mix adjusted on every basis but weve never seen like cecl working in a loan growth environment so just kind of your guys thoughts as loan growth starts to pick up for the industry could we start to see some growth math where you need to add provisions and add to reserves just for growth or is the growth like contemplated in your reserves today or as loan growth picks up do you have growthdriven provisioning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah i can answer that one john thats complex and in some instances i dont know if we know because we havent run cecl through an environment like that but academically speaking we will get to the point where we will need to grow reserves in concert with bigger balance sheets bigger loan balances but were still in this place the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 where were running high in terms of percentage terms so theres going to be some offsetting factors there is my guess in john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah okay fair enough thanks operator thank you ill now turn the conference back to mr demchak for your concluding remarks thank you sir william stanton demchak chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc all right no concluding remarks i know you guys are busy thank you for dialing and we got a lot of calls today look forward to talking to you in the first quarter
