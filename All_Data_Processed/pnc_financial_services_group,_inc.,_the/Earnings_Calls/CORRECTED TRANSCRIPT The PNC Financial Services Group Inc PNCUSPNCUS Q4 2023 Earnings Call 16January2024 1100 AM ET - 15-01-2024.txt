bryan and good morning everyone during a challenging and volatile operating environment for the banking industry pnc performed well during and delivered a solid finish in the fourth quarter for the full year adjusting for the fourth quarter impact of the fdic special assessment and expenses related to a staff reduction initiative that we completed in the fourth quarter we earned per diluted share compared to per diluted share in throughout the year and amidst all the disruption we continue to grow our customer base and deepen relationships across our coasttocoast franchise importantly we generated record revenue and controlled core expenses which allowed us to deliver a modest amount of positive adjusted operating leverage for the fourth quarter we reported million in net income or diluted per share and per share on an adjusted basis robs going to take you through the financials in a moment but id like to highlight a few points first as we announced in early october we closed on the acquisition of the capital commitment loans from signature which is immediately accretive to earnings secondly as we expected we saw meaningful growth from noninterest income during the fourth quarter driven primarily by a rebound in capital markets and advisory fees third we completed the actions to reduce our workforce and we are positioned to realize million of expense savings in this is in addition to our cip savings target for that rob will discuss in a few minutes expense discipline remains a top priority for us and accordingly we are targeting stable expenses for even as we continue to invest in key growth initiatives fourth our credit quality remained strong during the quarter reflecting our thoughtful approach to growing our balance sheet while we continue to expect credit chargeoffs to increase over time particularly in the cre office segment were adequately reserved finally during the fourth quarter we increased our capital position saw solid improvement in our aoci intangible book value and repurchased a modest amount of shares the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 in summary we run our company with a focus

and deliver shareholder value in the coming year and beyond as always i want to thank our employees for everything they do to meet the needs of our customers and make our success possible and with that ill turn it over to rob robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bill and good morning everyone our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on an average basis and compared to the third quarter loans were up and averaged billion which include the acquired signature capital commitment loans investment securities declined billion or cash balances at the federal reserve increased billion to billion and deposits increased billion and averaged billion borrowed funds increased billion to billion driven by higher fhlb borrowings and parent company senior debt issuances at yearend pnc was fully compliant with the proposed holding company longterm debt requirements and we expect to reach compliance with the banklevel metrics through our normal course of funding well in advance of the phasein period aoci improved billion to negative billion at quarterend primarily reflecting the impact of favorable interest rate movements during the quarter accordingly tangible book value increased to per common share up linkedquarter and compared to the same period a year ago we remain wellcapitalized with an estimated cet1 ratio of as of december which increased basis points linkedquarter our estimated fully phasedin expanded riskbased cet1 ratio based on the new proposed capital rules would be approximately at yearend which is wellabove our current requirement of we continue to be wellpositioned with capital flexibility during the quarter we resumed modest share repurchase activity of approximately million or roughly million shares and when combined with million of common dividends we returned a total of million of capital to shareholders slide shows our loans in more detail compared to the third quarter average loan balances increased driven by higher commercial loan balances and modest growth in consumer commercial loans were billion an increase of billion driven by the acquisition of the signature capital commitment portfolio excluding the billion full quarter average impact from the signature loan portfolio commercial loans declined billion or driven by lower utilization and soft loan demand consumer loans grew approximately million driven by higher residential mortgage balances partially offset by lower home equity and credit card balances and loan yields increased basis points to in the fourth quarter slide covers our deposits in more detail average deposits grew billion to billion during the quarter as seasonal growth in commercial deposits was partially offset by a decline in consumer deposits in regard to mix consolidated noninterestbearing deposits were in the fourth quarter down slightly from in the third quarter and consistent with our expectations we continue to expect the noninterestbearing portion of our deposits to stabilize near current levels the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 our current rate paid on interestbearing deposits increased to during the fourth quarter up from in the prior quarter as of december our cumulative deposit beta was and in line with our expectation for the quarter as we stated previously we expect betas to drift modestly higher while interest rates remain at current level and our current forecast calls for the first rate cut to occur in mid2024 at which point we believe the rate paid on deposits will begin to decline slide details our investment security and swap portfolios average investment securities of billion decreased as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities the securities portfolio yield increased basis points to reflecting the runoff of loweryielding securities as of december the duration of the investment securities portfolio was years our receivefixed swaps pointing to the commercial loan book totaled billion on december the weighted average receivefixed rate of our swap portfolio increased basis points to and the duration of the portfolio was years aoci improved by billion in the fourth quarter reflecting lower interest rates importantly as lower rate securities and swaps roll off we expect a continued meaningful improvement to tangible book value from aoci accretion turning to the income statement on slide fourth quarter net income was million or per share which included pretax noncore expenses of million or million aftertax related to the fdic special assessment and the workforce reduction charges incurred in the fourth quarter excluding noncore expenses adjusted eps was total revenue of billion increased to million or compared to the third quarter of net interest income declined modestly by million and our net interest margin was a decline of basis points noninterest income increased million or noninterest expense of billion increased million or and included million of noncore expenses core noninterest expense was billion and increased million or provision was million in the fourth quarter and our effective tax rate was full year revenue grew compared to core noninterest expense was well controlled and grew importantly our disciplined expense management and cip savings allowed us to deliver modest positive operating leverage and ppnr growth of on an adjusted basis turning to slide we highlight our revenue trends fourth quarter revenue was up million or compared with the third quarter driven by strong fee income as net interest income of billion was down modestly fee income was billion and increased million or linkedquarter looking at the detail capital markets and advisory fees rebounded as expected and increased million or driven by higher ma advisory fees asset management and brokerage revenue grew million or reflecting favorable market conditions and residential and commercial mortgage revenue declined million or primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights other noninterest income of million increased million or and included favorable valuation adjustments and gains on sales the fourth quarter also included million negative visa fair value adjustment compared to a million negative adjustment in the third quarter as a reminder at december pnc owned million visa class b shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately billion the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 turning to slide our fourth quarter noninterest expense of billion was up million and included million of noncore charges core noninterest expense of billion increased million or linked quarter reflecting higher business activity seasonality and asset impairments during the quarter we incurred million of impairment charges which were largely related to building writeoffs notably in we reduced our nonbranch footprint by million square feet or approximately for the full year core noninterest expense of billion increased million or expense growth was well controlled due in part to the million midyear increase in our cip goal to million which we exceeded as a result we generated basis points of adjusted positive operating leverage for the full year looking forward to our annual cip target is million this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments and as of yearend we completed actions related to the workforce reduction that will drive million of cost savings in taken together were implementing million of expense management actions all of which are reflected in our guidance that i will cover in a few minutes our credit metrics are presented on slide while overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio we did see a slight uptick in npls and delinquencies nonperforming loans increased million or linked quarter and included a million increase in cre total delinquencies of billion increased million or linkedquarter the increase included seasonally higher consumer delinquencies the majority of which have already been resolved net loan chargeoffs were million in the fourth quarter and came in at the low end of our expectations our annualized net chargeoffs to average loans ratio was basis points and our allowance for credit losses totaled billion or of total loans on december stable with september the cre office portfolio is where we continue to see the most stress and fourth quarter net loan chargeoffs were million we continue to expect future losses on this portfolio however we believe weve adequately reserved for those potential losses as of december our reserves on the office portfolio were of total office loans and inside of that on the multitenant portfolio importantly our overall cre office portfolio declined or approximately million linkedquarter reflecting a higher level of payoffs criticized office loans were flat and nonperforming loans increased linkedquarter naturally well continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect current market conditions and a full update of this portfolio is included in the appendix slides in summary pnc reported a solid fourth quarter and fullyear in regard to our view of the overall economy were expecting a mild recession starting in mid2024 with a contraction in real gdp of less than we expect the federal funds rate to remain unchanged between and through mid2024 when we expect the fed to begin to cut rates we expect a reduction of basis points in with a 25basispoint decrease in july november and december looking ahead our outlook for full year compared to results is as follows we expect spot loan growth of to which equates to average loan growth of approximately total revenue to be stable to down inside of that our expectation is for net interest income to be down in the range of to and noninterest income to be up to core noninterest expenses to be stable and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 our outlook for the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of is as follows we expect average loans to be stable net interest income to be down to fee income to be down to due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity as well as elevated fourth quarter capital markets and advisory levels other non interest income to be in the range of million and million excluding visa activity taking the component pieces of revenue together we expect total revenue to be down to we expect total core noninterest expense to be down to we expect first quarter net chargeoffs to be between million and million and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from john mcdonald with autonomous research please proceed john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research good morning wanted to ask rob and bill about the loan growth outlook for the spot guidance of up to seems a bit better than what were seeing in h8 currently i thought you could give some color on the drivers of your outlook there thank you robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure hey john good morning its rob yeah on the outlook so average loans up spot to as you mentioned we see most of that being on the commercial side and most of that being on the back end of the year consumer we do have some growth throughout the year but pretty modest john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and rob on the net interest income guidance sounds like youre assuming three rate cuts a little bit less than what the forward curve has just kind of wondering what would be the sensitivity if the forward curve played out and we saw more rate cuts than what youre assuming is that helpful to the nii outlook all else equal or relatively neutral could you update us on the sensitivity there please robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure john yeah the short answer is its relatively neutral because as you know weve worked hard to get our balance sheet into a neutral sensitivity position so not a lot of variance in terms of the forwards and our own expectations in terms of the impact on nii the big question obviously is going to be on deposit pricing and how that behaves as the year plays out but we dont expect a lot of variance john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thank you the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question comes from john pancari with evercore please proceed john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the capital markets revenue the numbers certainly came in really solid this quarter as you look into and in the context of your up to noninterest income guidance for the full year how are you thinking about capital markets trajectory through the year off of this level thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah hey john good morning yeah so with capital markets we did get the rebound that we were expecting in the fourth quarter and the bulk of that is in our harris williams our ma advisory business as far as guidance goes the pipelines are good we expect sort of the fourth quarter and the first quarter of to be the range of what we would see on a quarterly basis going through in the anomalies were the soft quarters of  and  in so take a look at the first quarter of the fourth quarter of and thats the range of what we would expect the quarterly run rate to be through john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right rob thanks for that and then separately robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc ill even help you there john its up about yearoveryear ill save you the math there john pancari q analyst evercore isi right yeah all right thanks for that and then your guidance for implies about basis points negative operating leverage using the midpoint of the guidance which actually screens relatively well versus your peers how sustainable is that if the rate environment does not pan out as youre modeling and or better put if your revenue outlook is worse do you think you can sustain at that expected negative basis points operating leverage or could it be worse thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look were fairly neutral for our nii forecast toward as a function of rate cuts or not so the outcome ought to be the same robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 yeah well i would add to that john so we worked hard we took some actions to position ourselves to have stable expenses yearoveryear so thats a lot and then as bill pointed out on the revenue side the nii is fairly predictable on a relative basis outside of rates and then the fees we feel good about the guidance so thats what we think is going to occur william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think if theres variance anywhere its going to be on our assumptions as it relates to deposit betas the continued shift to interestbearing versus noninterestbearing and ultimately the steepness of the yield curve the rates at the long end of the curve as opposed to the front end of the curve weve tried to be to the best of our ability a little bit on the conservative side of all of those things and we feel pretty good about where our forecast is john pancari q analyst evercore isi great all right thank you operator our next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everybody thanks for taking the question i was hoping you might be able to share just some updated thoughts on sort of where and when nii might bottom and i think perhaps more importantly magnitude of rebound that we might see thereafter i know you sort of suggested last month that nii ultimately could be a record in i guess id be curious for any updated context around your thoughts there robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure scott good morning yeah so as we pointed out we do see nii going down in the first half of the year troughing around the time of the cuts and then growing from there and beyond so think about where we are now go down a bit and then grow back to where we are now and then in what gives us a lot of confidence around record nii is we will get the compounded effect of the repricing of our fixed rate assets as that continues into so thats what we laid out a month ago and thats still what we think r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay thank you and then i guess just on the notion of deposit pricing it sounds like youre expecting deposit cost to ease right around the time the fed starts cutting whats your sense for sort of the pace of deposit betas on the way down visàvis what they were on the way up robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc well i would say on the commercial and the high networth side fast and then we talked about on the consumer sort of the core consumer we could and this is what bill was alluding to there earlier we could continue to see some drift up in rate paid even though we get some cuts so thats a big variable obviously and well have to play it out the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning thanks for outlining the macro assumptions behind the outlook and appreciate your comments on loan growth being more backend loaded but can you give us some more color on how youre thinking about it because you also mentioned a mild recession midyear so is it really a big uptick in ci in maybe like as rates begin to come down and as we come out of that mild recession so i was hoping you could give us some more color on both commercial and consumer there robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc so i would just say just to follow up on that so yeah back half of the year on the commercial side we see the uptick in the third and the fourth quarter a big part of that being expected increase in utilization which is a little bit lower right now and then just some pickup in general economic activity not a lot to spot to average up and then on the consumer just sort of slow steady growth nothing big there maybe a little bit more in card and auto and a little bit less in resi manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then just on the credit side last quarter you had some cre loans move from criticized into npls and it looks like things have been pretty steady this quarter on both criticized and npls so do you think at this stage you guys have scrubbed the books and it should remain steady over the next few quarters with just ncos ticking up or is it likely to be lumpy the question is more given the new outlook for rates to come down do you think the worst is behind us william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well not on chargeoffs we think were reserved correctly but you have to remember that as these loans go to npl and eventually if we have charges against them well charge them off it wont run through pl because weve already created a reserve for it but the works set on actually maturing the loans and dealing with the outcome is yet to come robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and i would just add to that the key number to look at there is the criticized percentage which has not changed much to bills point thats the first bucket the movement of that to nonperforming or chargeoffs will occur but its that criticized number thats the key number manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 got it thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc please proceed gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning bill good morning rob robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys share with us you talked rob about the commercial loan growth in the quarter when you ex out the signature purchase was down slightly i know you have prospects for growth here in as you pointed out but can you share with us do you guys see much competition from the private credit market the private equity guys that have been much more aggressive recently in lending and second and part of that you have them as customers as well so do you have to balance them as competitors as well as customers william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we dont compete with them headtohead with the types of loans theyre typically in because we dont play that much in the unsecured leverage space most of the decline at signature we saw was in utilization robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and some seasonality william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah as we go forward more and more of the lending markets are moving into private hands and longerterm that is of a concern if they kind of move up scale in what they do we do serve them i would say that our client base with just call it private equity or private managers at large theyre probably our largest clients between what we do with and for them from harris williams and solebury and business credit and treasury management with their portfolio companies and on and on and on so they are good clients and i guess at the margin we could end up competing with them in certain things robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc but not so much today william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i see okay thank you and then rob the followup with your comments you gave us the visa ownership and the unrealized gain if i recall correctly i think first quarter of the owners of those shares are permitted to monetize that can you give us your updated thoughts on what you guys are thinking with your position in visa robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure gerard so our position is we have billion in unrealized gains million b shares as you pointed out theres a vote by the visa shareholders at the end of this month to approve an action to enable the b holders to monetize maybe up to so we dont control that we see when the vote is scheduled should it be approved then well move forward with our monetization plans that would be allowed under whatever is approved gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning bill and rob following up on credit if we play out what the soft landing scenario could look like and the fed starts cutting rates in mid2024 would you expect to be in a position to possibly start releasing reserves or are the theres sort of likely to still be latecycle concerns that would lead you to want to maintain the reserve levels that youve already established robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hi bill its rob so first our reserves are appropriate for what we expect to occur so thats number one number two if things should substantially improve yes sure were running at right now which historically is on the high side so if things normalize out and your definition of normal we could be lower bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it and then bill following up on your comment about feeling good about your reserve levels but that we havent necessarily seen peak chargeoff rates yet if we were to go down the mild recession scenario path should we expect there to be some lag between when those chargeoffs would actually hit the pl and when the corresponding reserves would get released or would the releases kind of occur concurrent with the increase in chargeoffs william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so remember the chargeoffs dont hit pl there seems to be a lot of confusion on that the provisions we take hit pl and weve provided for our best expectation of future chargeoffs in a scenario that assumes a mild the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 recession so if our scenario comes true were fully reserved for everything that might happen to us chargeoffs will flow through but not hit our pl because theyre effectively neutralized against the debit to the provision bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood i guess what i im sorry william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc there always seems to be robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc thats worth pointing out thats worth pointing out william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc there always seems to be some confusion on that but does that make sense bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah no i understand i guess where i was going with that is that some have sort of alluded to allowing if the credit environment does indeed deteriorate allowing some of those losses to flow through without necessarily releasing reserves and so even though theyve established reserves they would kind of maintain those reserves and allow the higher chargeoffs to flow through before ultimately releasing and i was just hoping to get your thoughts on kind of the timing of those different pieces william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so its a mechanical calculation thats dependent on our view of the economy at the time so if you got to a place where the chargeoffs occur and somehow we thought the economy was worse than our current expectation we would be providing for the remainder of the portfolio at a higher level than we are today right but right now we dont expect that to happen so if the economy is worse simply put if the economy is worse than a mild recession then you would expect our total reserve to increase robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc because its forwardlooking william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc per cecl the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood if i could squeeze in one last one on capital return i appreciate slide can you speak to how youre thinking about that 150basispoint impact from basel iii endgame in light of some of the pushback that its received and is that a level you feel comfortable running at or would you target a slightly higher buffer and then sort of underlying all of that how are you thinking about buybacks in light of all the moving pieces william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well answer the easy question first would be too low i think in this new environment assuming basel iii endgame goes through so wed run at some higher number than that for certain there does appear to be substantial commentary on the proposal such that i would expect that if it isnt reproposed there still would be some relief in certain asset categories and riskweighted assets and maybe on operating risk capital well see having said that we dont know so at the moment what we know is were going to continue to grow earnings were going to accrete aoci back into our capital base and were going to pull that up we think we have flexibility inside of that to be active in the share repurchase market between now and then and the more certainty we have the more certain well be and explicit on what we might buy back during a given period of time robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and i would just add to that you saw we bought just under million of sorry share repurchases in the fourth quarter in the first quarter we would expect to do at least that maybe a little bit more depending on market conditions bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thank you for taking my questions operator our next question comes from erika najarian with ubs please proceed erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning i just wanted to ask one followup question on nii if i may a lot of investors were really excited about the graphic that you put together at goldman the nike swoosh if you will that had sort of the first rate cut embedded under the nike swoosh basis points in and i completely understand this is abstract in a way but i just wanted to put together everything that you guys said i think it surprises investors that when you overlay the forward curve that it is neutral to this outcome at least for but just looking back at the slides rob and slide of this earnings season it does seem like a lot of your receivefixed swaps dont really meaningfully mature until so i guess in terms of like the mechanical repricing that you keep talking about the way to really ask this question is it sounds like it is possible to have potentially a lower trough than people expected in and still have that record net interest income in because of those fixed rate dynamics and who knows what can the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 happen on the liability side and the deposit repricing side if the fed cuts sooner but it feels like that swap maturity is part of why that nike swoosh could be deeper am i thinking about it the right way william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i dont know that we expect it to be deeper we purposely drew the line to be a little bit thick because we dont know exactly when that trough might occur i think all of the commentary on is in some ways mechanical its simply taking our fixed rate assets and repricing them at market and we know what the maturities of those assets are so in short form one of the reasons we highlight that and also show the steepness of the curve is our balance sheet the fixed rate assets on our balance sheet are shorter than virtually all of our peers and at a yield level that is somewhat lower so we have a big pickup in fixed rate earning yields sooner than i think the market expects which is in turn what gives rise to the slope of that curve whether it troughs in the second quarter or the first week in the third quarter or the fourth week who knows robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc but still were confident that erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc i dont think its the perfect timing though that investors are worried about in terms of second quarter and third quarter its just that your new guidance would imply sort of after the first quarter that your average nii would be like or something like that right so to get to a record net interest income it would have to be a pretty significant progression from there so thats sort of im trying to set the stage for you guys to build that bridge because i think that investors really believe that you can reach that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah but i think that that id call it the swoosh i think the swoosh is still accurate i think erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and what else to say its consistent with our guidance and its still accurate erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc perfect thank you operator our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies please proceed the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey guys good morning just a followup on that swaps book on page of the deck a couple billion dollar decline in the receivefixed any changes this quarter whether terminations or new adds and any thoughts in terms of like how you change and utilize that in terms of last answer of trying to move that forward thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i dont know that we had changes this quarter robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc going into  is that the question ken william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc ken are you talking about ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc no did you terminate any swaps this quarter and add any new and just kind of remind us of the understanding of whats still yet to go after indiscernible robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah we terminated some we added some net down but thats all in the normal course william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think were missing your question what are you trying to get at ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah i was just trying to get at just what changes youve made inside of the portfolio outside of the normal maturity schedule which i think we see in the disclosures quarterly just wondering did you terminate swaps did you add some new ones and then just remind us about the way forward william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we terminated ph and added some and just to remind you when you terminate you basically lock in that loss through the life of the original contract and well do that at times simply to reposition where we have exposure ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 yeah exactly okay got it second question just on the fee outlook good to see first of all in the fourth quarter the capital markets improvement that you saw just wondering how much of a driver is that of your expected fee growth next year your pipelines in harris williams et cetera and what other pieces do you expect to see growth in this year thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah hey ken as i said earlier on the capital markets a nice rebound in our harris williams activity pipelines are good they support yearoveryear growth of close to which is what i mentioned earlier in terms of the other fee categories asset management flattish up a bit that will be marketdependent card and cash management up low to midsingle digits lending and deposit services that will be down midsingle digits and thats reflective of anticipated lower service charges on deposits there was a number of items that we did in to reduce overdraft charges for our clients so thats good for our clients but that will be some lower fees about midsingle digit down and then mortgage outside of hedge gains flattish down if you include the hedge gains ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right rob thank you for that robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo please proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey bill december your ardent words i quote skill matters today more than it ever has prior to march and the mini crisis we knew that technology mattered we knew scale and brand mattered just eliminated tailoring and regulation for all intents and purposes et cetera et cetera youre just going to say that this will never be reverse scale is more important than ever i could give the whole speech but it seemed like a passioned william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i know its tough mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc speech more than ive ever heard you say before so why now and along those lines i mean if you had better scale when you get positive operating leverage in with a chance you could do that but i think youre talking further out i think youre talking about organic and maybe inorganic expansion but help me out there if you could the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah no i was look if you just look back at what happened this year on top of kind of eight or nine years of history post the financial crisis weve seen your words goliath win in terms of organic deposit share growth that trend line has accelerated as a function of the mini crisis in march where corporates bluntly dont necessarily trust the regulatory environment to ensure that their deposits at a bank are safe and so weve seen those deposits flow uphill and if you arent a primary relationship with that corporate deeply embedded with treasury management and other services you netnet lose corporate deposits i think when you combine that with the cost of technology the removal of some of the tiering and regulation and capital requirements and liquidity scale matters i think we are on net benefited from the mini crisis but just barely and i think below us people struggle with that conversation with corporate clients above us perhaps its easy but i think we need to move into that next level such that we are seen coasttocoast is a ubiquitous standard brand with the quasi support that the giant banks have in terms of times of crisis i think its critical mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so what does that mean okay so you identified the need and desire so what does that mean does it mean william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think naturally mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i know youre always of yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so naturally over time we are gaining share on our newer markets at a rapid pace and we see that client acquisition and growth in all forms from deposits to loans to fees to so forth i think through time youre going to see a clear differentiation of this dynamic played out across the market i think theres going to be banks that are looking for strong partners and i think we are a strong partner im not going to force that issue but i think longerterm we are a natural player in the consolidation of an industry where scale matters mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and if you cant get the deals done youve been opportunistic with national city and et cetera since then organic ubiquity how can you get there do we start seeing you advertise during the super bowl do you double or triple your marketing spend what do you do then william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 you just have to execute i mean theres a which simplifies the process if you think about whats happening in the banking industry today theres a couple ignore some other issues with the large banks but on the deposit share side theres a couple of clear winners theres one that probably should be over time theres some people neutral and theres people losing theres banks in the country that i can take from and grow right thats just a longer period of time which we will pursue than what we might see if theres inorganic opportunities when people come to the realization that theyre kind of riding something down in a deteriorating franchise mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i can see the trends i know how we would react to opportunities and the trends i know what well do to execute on our own and im confident in that but id go all the way back scale matters were going to have to play that game mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc just want to follow up i got several emails from people saying well i dont know if i want to own pnc stock because im afraid of what kind of deal they might do what do you say to that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think they should look at our history is my simplest explanation i think somebody asked me that question once before and i assure everybody i still know how to do math and i think the opportunities will come our way i dont think well have to chase them one of the reasons people say why am i as vocal about this as i am and part of the reason is to make the public aware the public being regulators politicians boards of other banks aware of whats happening in the banking industry and the need for consolidation doesnt mean im going to do something stupid in the pursuit of it i just think its going to happen mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess just maybe one i have to follow up on your discussion with mike around ma i guess do you think the regulatory backdrop today is conducive for doing ma or do we need a very different sort of doj just philosophical approach towards larger bank deals before we could see a pickup in deal activity william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 i dont think theres a simple answer to that because i think if you listen carefully to the various speeches that have been done theyll talk about the recognition of the need for ma but theyll also talk about good mergers and bad mergers good outcomes and bad outcomes along several metrics so put differently i think certain deals will get approved and others wouldnt i think we have proven as an acquirer that we know what were doing and that the resulting institution is in fact stronger than the one we might acquire ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and i guess just taking a step back around your view around the mild recession im just wondering how much of that is just theoretical informing your reserving model versus the weakness that youre seeing across your customers and that leads you to believe that we will have a recession in the middle of the year because once we go down that path who knows how bad things could get so just would love to hear whether the recession assumption is just your conservatism or are you seeing weakness across your customers william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean you see the credit metrics its not a concern in terms of customers weve seen with the margin profit margins decrease with certain clients if you look at soft inputs surveys and so forth that are coming out of the fed districts the economy is definitely weakening not at a alarming pace its kind of what we had expected given how tight the fed has gotten with monetary policy so we kind of see a mild recession we actually see employment remaining strong through that which ultimately is the thing that keeps the economy from going deeply into recession just the strength of the labor market and consumer spending so this is kind of following the path of what we thought for some period of time now ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and one quick followup robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yes ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc go ahead yeah just a quick followup rob robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc i was just going to add ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah go ahead the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc i was just going to add to that to bills i mean we can have a slowdown continue and technically hit a recession without adding a whole lot of credit risk or increased credit structure ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and just one thing rob you mentioned that you expect noninterestbearing deposits to stabilize from here just playing devils advocate why should they stabilize from here if rates remain if were in a 3plus fed funds world should we not expect the mix of deposits to move towards interestbearing towards more cds or is your view different robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc well i think obviously weve been watching that for the better part of the year here in terms of the decline in non interestbearing in absolute terms and relative percentages why we think its largely happened is because its been so long and much of that base is businesses and individuals that run on noninterestbearing deposits so theyre not necessarily shopping for a higher rate theres something around the institution in terms of they pay for their services through deposits or on the consumer side small transaction accounts ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi guys just wondering your thoughts on kind of mediumterm loan growth a bit of a bigger picture question you obviously gave details for this year but as you think out like the next couple of years are you in the camp that there needs to be some structural deleveraging so loan growth might be below gdp or where normally it would be or just any thoughts that you have on that thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean i dont think theres going to be any structural delevering here were obviously seeing a lot of banks kind of on my prior point coming to the conclusion that some of the ancillary lending activities they took on on the back of the big stimulus dont make sense anymore so theres deleveraging maybe across the industry by certain groups but not here the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and i guess i meant from customers right look even if rates go down a little bit theyre still structurally a lot higher than theyve been for last almost years so if you just think about like the lending demand thats out there obviously theres lots of factors but just thoughts on if higher rate structurally have a meaningful impact on that thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sorry on loan growth matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc correct right as you think about corporate borrowers right they just cant afford potentially to borrow as much with rates higher obviously the same for consumer mortgage is the most obvious so thinking more like on the commercial side william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well i think at the end of the day our generic corporate client needs to redo their facilities and the price has gone up and that will occur i think some of the activity that we saw on the back of just really low cost of capital in the private equity markets where kind of leverage is free thats going to go by the wayside at a higher rate environment but if you look at the composition of our book were kind of the bread and butter of america so i wouldnt expect that we would necessarily see a decline in loan growth simply because the frontend of sofr rate is higher matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator our next question comes from dave rochester with compass point please proceed david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys just back on the ma discussion i know you mentioned building in a bigger buffer than that you have on your adjusted cet1 ratio today but is the plan to also maybe retain more capital than you normally would to better position you for taking advantage of any inorganic opportunities which might keep the buyback activity more muted this year just curious to get your thoughts there how you might balance that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well there i mean both of those thoughts are consistent is too low so were going to grow whether were growing to be in faster compliance or growing because maybe something shows up where we could use some were still going to grow and its going to mute our capital return below it it otherwise might be absent the basel iii endgame changes the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay so you would expect buyback activity maybe to remain muted for the rest of the year not just the first quarter william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc theres too much up in the air i mean its david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc depending what the fed does look they could have to repropose that it could go through the elections they could change it materially we dont know right all we know is all else equal is probably too low were still burning through our aoci we dont think thats going to change so stay the course and well adapt based on what we learn david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then back on your deposit betas youre assuming in the guide are you thinking you can move those commercial rates down materially more like right out of the gate with the first cut or are you baking in some sort of a lag at least for the first couple cuts robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc itd be pretty fast david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay great all right thanks guys operator our next question comes from vivek juneja with jpmorgan please proceed william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey vivek operator vivek your line is open please proceed with your question bryan k gill a executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 do we have any more calls robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc questions operator we do have a question from mike mayo with wells fargo please proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah just a followup on your commercial loan growth like why youre punching your weight in the growth rate and which areas of commercial loan growth and i know youve deployed teams to all these cities near the nashville main street bank and youre trying to gain share and all that is it that effort the market share by city is it kind of smaller middle market is it that effect you talked about scale versus the smaller competitors i mean how much we put in each bucket as far as your delta versus peer when it comes to commercial loan growth william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look i would tell you that were winning more than were losing on pitches and thats more true today than it was premarch were winning at a higher percentage just because theres more shots on goal in the new markets than we are in the old markets so the growth there is higher and those new markets and the fact that we have them fully staffed including products mike differentiates us in a world where total loan growth may be somewhat tepid and importantly we believe weve said this for years as we go into new markets we are not leading with credit in these new markets feebased growth actually outpaces our loanbased growth in those markets as we crosssell into tm and other products and services so we look at pipelines we look at line of sight into what we have in each market i dont know that theres any particular product that stands out as something thats growing faster than another one its just were winning clients mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc last followup how much faster would your commercial loan growth be if there were no private capital competitors right now william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think the only way that impacts us directly i mean that the margin maybe something in business credit and as you know we partner with a lot of the private credit guys inside of that business and then to the extent companies are taken private which i think is going to slow down given the cost of capital we sometimes will lose a client to a leverage lender because they were taken private but thats kind of robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc at a structure ph we would want financing right the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but wed want them yeah robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc that would be the margin because if that wasnt available that would otherwise be a conventional loan william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thanks again william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks mike viveks back operator and we have a question from vivek juneja with jpmorgan please proceed vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc sorry about that i dont know what happened there but bill a question for you your deposits at the fed keep growing at what point are you thinking about putting some of that or locking some of the yields on that whats your thinking there especially given all your other commentary about rates peaking mild recession loan growth et cetera triangulating all of those factors william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well in the nearterm we think the markets gotten ahead of itself i think until were clear of the outcome here or clear inflation and fed actions were happy to kind of stay neutral i think my own expectation here vivek is notwithstanding what the fed does through the course of with the fed funds rate my expectation is youre not going to see a lot of action in the longer rate simply because of the supply calendar and the fact that inflation will have a tail and while the fed could ease somewhat i think inflation is still going to be running against versus their goal well have a lot of issues so long story short we dont see a burning desire to put money to work here because we think that opportunity is going to remain in the durations we typically invest in and probably get a little bit better just given how hot the market got post the last fed meeting vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2024 thanks and second one you talked about a lot of companies going into private hands and obviously that creating competition from private credit for loans but on the other hand youve got increasing capital requirements which is translating into higher spreads so as to maintain returns how do you balance that out on the one hand not losing share to the private market and on the other hand maintaining that given that do you see spreads staying high or do you think that turns course the other way william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so again were kind of talking about two different universes of credit but having said that im sure youve heard this inside of your own shop lending money for the sake of lending money doesnt give us an adequate return on capital didnt before it doesnt now what gives us a return on capital is the relationship the annuitylike fees you get from tm the additive fees you get from capital marketsrelated activity and price is kind of a third order effect on the return on capital we get with that client relationship private credit at the moment sees a return in private credit because they could put some leverage on it and theres not a big opportunity in private equity and yields are high and theyll chase that for a period of time i dont know that thats a particularly great investment through the cycle and we dont try to compete with it in that lending environment vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator there are no further questions at this time bryan k gill executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc okay well thank you very much for participating in the call and if you have any followups feel free to reach out to the ir team thank you and good luck this quarter
